"i like costco because they sell really big things, but pay really big wages.\n\nbut the more self-interested motivation is that they also have the most liberal return policy known to humankind. really. i defy you to find a more accepting one.\n\ni was worried about returning the sound system that i had bought for the weekend. forget that. the guy in front of me returned a big jar of peanuts. two-thirds empty. that he didn't buy.\n\nyes, that's right, he returned 1/3 a jar of peanuts that he did not purchase and got full store credit. jeez."
"I've stopped here on multiple occasions and have not been disappointed.  I know this is a chain store, but I can't complain about it.\n\nEach time I have stopped in here to get an item I have actually been over helped, if that's a thing.  I know what I need when I walk into a store like this, but that doesn't stop the employees from jumping at the chance to help you out.  \n\nThe last time I was here I already knew what I needed and where it was, but the guy behind the register yelled back to me that it would be quicker if I went to him and he'd get it for me.\n\n*Battery dead?  They will assist you in putting a new one in."
"Looking for a bargain, came in to check out their clearance tent.  Want a mattress for our spare room, with frequent visits from family, it would be nice to finally get them off the air mattress.  But prices are outrageous and we left without finding one.  Like the show room and they didn't seem to be very aggressive salesman, so we'll be back."
"Their furniture selection is sad, but they do have a larger jewelry display. I found two knives that were pretty good for $2. That's about all I have to say about this place."
"Very nervous finding a new stylist. Read reviews and chose the salon, love the urban atmosphere. Parking was tough since it was late afternoon, there is a garage but was packed and all the side streets were full for over a block, so allow time to park. \nI wanted a change since I'll be turning 50 in a few weeks. I met with Keith, he listened to what I was looking for, gave me suggestions, helped me choose  complimentary colors for base and highlights and adjusted a style from a picture I'd brought in. I couldn't be happier with the results! The color is natural, the style suits my face well, I've heard so many great compliments from co-workers, how they love the style and that it makes me look younger, just what I needed to hear! I'll be a regular for sure"
"I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants.  I have an even harsher view when it comes to Italian chain restaurants.  All that said....I dig the Macaroni Grill!  Before they came to Charlotte, I used to drive 45 minutes out of my way to eat with them....in Greenville, SC no less!"
"If this place wasn't so out of the way for me to get to, I'd go here almost every single opportunity I have.  Having had both the Sunday brunch and Pho off the regular menu, I personally don't think the brunch is all that special; the Summer Rolls were great but I didn't really like much else.  As for the Pho, I cannot begin to describe how fantastic it is.  The soup is good, the texture of the noodles is good and the meat (I always get beef, whether it's meatball, brisket, trite, etc.) is good too!  So many flavors can be stacked here, I love it."
3 1/2 stars. Doesn't have the number of rolls that most places have. \n\nA little joint in a strip mall. I was afraid to go in but we were with friends who rave about it. There was only one other table when we arrived but many more when we left. We all did AYCE. Delivery was fairly quick. Cajun is amazing. We loved the super crunch roll although we ordered a second after devouring the first and it was not the exact same roll. Ordered snow crab twice and never got it.  They cut off our ordering on two different occasions. \n\nThis is not really close to areas of town we frequent. I had been craving AYCE and this definitely filled my itch. If you are in the area and looking for a place you should give it a shot.
"""We live in the building right next door to Calabria.  Before we moved in, I was sort of excited to see the word \""""grocery\"""" so close.  You know, for those milk emergencies.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that Calabria is NOT a grocery store - just a restaurant that offers an EXTREMELY limited selection of \""""grocery\"""" items - olives, spices, etc.  (I was thinking it would be like San Diego's Fillipi's).\n\nThat said, Calabria makes a mean sandwich.  I had a Caprese (one of my favorites) and it was on awesome bread, with a great cheese, and had lots of flavor (something that is sometimes lacking in a Caprese.)  The hubs had a meatball sub and commented on it's deliciousness.\n\nWe will definitely go back to Calabria.  It is close and good, even with the \""""false advertising.\"""""""
"""Low and behold. I am back reviewing at a Chinese restaurant in Charlotte in the \""""dangerous\"""" area of asian corner. And do I have an update for everyone who said not to go here.\n\nMy family and I have heard that a good friend who used to cook at a place before yelp's time was back at it again in Charlotte. And we definitely had to come eat his food again. The restaurant has taken a new turn for the better with this chef. They also replaced furniture and made it look better.\n\nIf you want some authentic Chinese, and you don't mind trying new food then follow what I ordered and you won't go wrong. This chef has cooked world wide and from, yes you guessed it. Hong Kong. \n\nSo this is what we ordered: duck feet, chinese broccoli with garlic, and fish. Three dishes, and all amazing. I can't comment on the price as I didn't pick up the tab. \n\nOverall since this chef is back, I will definitely be back to eat his food. (Note the date of this review as the chef will be leaving the country in a year...)"""
"Let me say that my palate is pretty vanilla. I don't really like to dive into new cuisines. A coworker convinced me to try this place during lunch, and I did so hesitantly.\n\nI stuck with something simply - chicken kabob lunch special which was about $9 bucks. It came with a drink, salad, rice, grilled veggies pita and of course chicken.\n\nTo my surprise it was actually good stuff. The rice melted in my mouth, and was nicely decorated with a sprinkle of saffron flavored rice. The chicken was moist. Even the salad was amazing, and I usually don't like greens. It had a very tasty dressing, which made it irresistible. \n\nI have been back a couple of times, and will be back. I will say that you don't get that much chicken, so if you're really hungry order a double kabob.\n\nOther than that - enjoy!"
"I was moving halfway across the country and my 03 civic started having serious issues. Got the car to these guys and it turned out to be a full on valve job that was needed! But they were super helpful, even stayed late to get it done for me so I could get back on the road and salvage the many plans and moving pieces with my move. Absolute life savers, and good honest guys. For the job they did the price was good too. I'm just sad I found such a great place but I don't anywhere near!"
"Okay, I was so hesitant about coming here because some of the reviews were a little negative. Yes, they are understaffed. Yes,  there will be a bit of a wait before you get seated. Yes, they did go through a chapter 11. But we were extremely satisfied with our meal. We had a loaded filet with a loaded potato & Mac & cheese & it was ridiculous!!! This meal was fantastic. Not much of a beer selection but once my meal came it didn't matter any more. Our waiter was a young dude named Derek & he was cool. Very friendly & helpful & honest. Next time we're in Phoenix we are definitely coming here."
"The menu is super cheap and has halfway decent options. However, they were somewhat lacking in meat options. The restaurant is also quite small, which can lead to a very long wait during sunday brunches."
"I was really nervous about having my wisdom teeth out. My dentist recommended Dr. Kramer and I'm so glad he did. Dr. Kramer was straight up with me--he said that my roots were long and curved and he would have to do a lot of work to remove them, particularly the back right. He also said my recovery would be a little rough. I appreciated his honesty. Fortunately, they were easier to get out than he thought, and I had an easy recovery. I do think it's slightly odd that they never at least called to check up on me, but I do believe they would have been attentive if I'd experienced a lot of pain post-surgery. I would recommend Dr. Kramer to any of my friends who need their wisdom teeth removed."
"I needed to have some tires I bought on-line installed. They were not available locally. I expected to get attitude wherever I went. \nThey were great about it. Took me right in and got me out within a time restraint I had.\nThey also did an inspection for me. I have a negative preconception of these, and expected to have a laundry list of excessive work to be done. They pointed up a couple if things and the solutions offered were reasonable. \nThey checked the alignment and could have told me it was in need of, but instead told me it was fine.  Great people and honest service. I will be going back."
"Late night hunger too often results in desperate and embarrassing decisions: \nPerkins, questionable street vendors...  \nEating the entire tub of ice cream in my freezer...\n\nBut no more! The Tornado Room took a meal I barely want to admit I eat and turned into something I can't stop talking about.  Their late night menu is classy and delicious.  So have a house cocktail with a shrimp cocktail and say goodbye to midnight trips to Taco Bell."
"Way back when I was visitng Charlotte for the first time I remember driving by this little place with a line out the door.  People used to rush out and start devouring their food immediately.  On nice days there would be people sitting on the curbs, boxes on hoods of cars or simply folks walking down the street stuffing their face.  And yes - i was one of those people.  Price's is a charlotte insitution and worth a trip if you are in town and like fried chicken.  If not ..i feel bad for you depriving yourself of one of lifes pleasures but oh well ..."
"After striking out at two other Pizza's places while in Madison, a co-worker recommended Greenbush and all it did was fill me regret. Why? Because I regretted spending money at other Pizza places while in town while I could have had more of their AWESOME thin crust while in town!\n\nOne of the best pepperoni thin crust pizza's I have had in recent memory. \n\nDon't let the small location, bad parking and other small negativities scare you a way!"
"I really like the pizza at Garcia's and I'd probably go more often if it didn't involve venturing onto campus or driving clear across CU.  The pizza is also usually cold (they don't seem to be getting a lot of business these days), which definitely has a negative impact on the flavor.  The prices are a bit on the high side for what you get, but not enough to be too concerned about it.\n\nBoth locations have kind of a pathetic vibe.  I know Garcia's used to be THE pizza place on campus years ago, and the restaurants definitely have that has-been thing going on that kind of makes you cringe with embarrassment for how far they've fallen."
"My Dearest Fudgery, \n\nYou had me at hello. Your drool-worthy, chocolate perfume greeted me at the door, and I was ready to shed my clothes and drop my money on your counter. Why do you flirt with me so, and make me watch the fudge being folded over and over and over again before me. I thought only women were capable of multiple o's? You heat me up when my lips whisper your name . . . Fudgery . . . ah yes, yes Fudgery . . . don't make me say it again. I am at your beck and call. I love to steal away with you and fill my mouth with your creamy goodness; you are my afternoon delight. My chest heaves and my breath quickness when I see you. You make me weak in the knees and I have to cross my legs when you are not there to satisfy me. I should hate you for giving free samples to any that ask, alas, I cannot hate you. \n\nYou complete me . . . dammit. I love to hate you. Ever thine, ever mine, ever ours . . . your Immortal Beloved."
"I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is delicious (which is the most important thing anyway), but service is just meh. Also the interior is a little cramped up with not much elbow room between tables. It must be about as wide as a train compartment. While we were there, they always had a lot of take out packs waiting at the counter so other people might be sharing my opinions about the service / crowded interiors too? But I repeat, the food is MIND BLOWING.\nWe had the spring roll appetizer which was just okay. For entrees we had the Pud Met Ma Muang (cashew nut) with duck. The duck was delicious. It was crispy and full of flavor. We will definitely be back to try more variety (or maybe just keep ordering the duck?) but I definitely do recommend this place."
"If you want a place to watch soccer and not just during the World Cup, why aren't you at Piper's? No matter the league, soccer can usually lbe found playing on at least one of the TVs unless there is a Steelers game.\n\nBut soccer alone isn't the sole reason to head to Piper's.  They have food that is good at any time of day.  You can also say that about the beer selection as well and that includes several cask-style beers on tapl.\n\nI can't add much that hasn't already been said in the other reviews"
"The foods not for fast food Chinese. It's not as greasy as some that I've had before, so it passes."
"It's been 3 years & I'm still thinking about the last time my taste buds did the happy dance while snarfling down yeasty salty garlic knots & gorging on velvety epiphanous baked ziti (How else would you describe tender ziti bathed in a creamy, tangy, garlicky ricotta marinara sauce?  That's right, I'm pretty certain some minor deities were involved.).  Sigh.  Not to mention inhaling the chocolate chip & ricotta-filled cannolis from their in-house bakery.  Oh & just in case you're curious, their toothy old school deli sandwiches are nothing to sneer at either.  Sigh.  [drool]\n\nYup.  I'm so far gone that I'm actually contemplating a trip to Lost Wages just so I can root around in a ziti-garlic-knot-cannoli-induced haze.  I wonder if they use FedEx?  Or even better, is there anyone in Las Vegas willing to negotiate a food exchange program?  Could I interest you in some tapas http://www.yelp.com/biz/toro-bravo-portland#hrid:5encXDc9LaFfQjKnfRwFoA or Marine Stewardship Council certified sushi? http://www.yelp.com/biz/bamboo-sushi-portland#hrid:T6h06m_n3mj__NJrPGIhIQ  How 'bout a Tom Kah cocktail? http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-observatory-portland#hrid:B4LA344HygZL0hk-SKfg1A  Don't decide now, just have your people get back to my people.

"""I'm here frequently for lunch because I work nearby. This location is mixed in with a bunch of other \""""quick eat\"""" places nearby. Panera is always good but the different locations can be hit or miss. I will say that this place is in an extremely busy area. There are a lot of professionals who work in the area and it can get outrageously busy. I usually order for pick-up for lunch cause of time.\n\nIt becomes hit or miss here. Sometimes my food will be ready and sometimes they will have no record of it. I have ended up spending half my lunch time there just waiting for them to actually get it ready. Otherwise, food is ready and i'm in and out within 5 minutes. They recently renovated and have plentiful seating, there is no shortage of staff EVER and the bakery is fresh and stocked full with goodies. All-in-all, a great lunch spot and an exceptionally clean and quick location!"""
"I'm surprised to be giving a four-star review! We hadn't been here in years and decided to give it a go. Service was very slow early on. Hushpuppy app was kind of sad. But then our server was able to get more focused, and then our meal came. Fish and grits...delish. My brother had the Red Beans & Rice and loved it. My husband's burger was great. So, despite a half empty restaurant on a Friday night and a slow start, our bellies and taste buds are very happy!"
"I'm going to stay in so many hotels the rest of this year, that I'm going to try to figure out how to sum up the PROS of a property in 5 words or less, in order of importance to me:\n\nClean\nComfortable\nQuiet\nFriendly \nInternet\n\nI can't do 5 words.  I spent 3 nights here last week.  The lobby is under construction for the next week I think, so there was no in-house booze while I was there, but it will be back soon.  Breakfast was fine.  Nothing outstanding about it, nothing bad either.  Staff is top notch here.  Free parking and easy access to the strip without the noise.   Would have been nice to have a mini-fridge in the room for yogurt and water.  Oh who am I kidding?  For ginger ale to go with my Jameson."
"First things first, the parking is terrible. I don't understand why you have to pay for it upfront when EVERYBODY validates. It makes it such a hassle. \n\nAs for the store selection, it is great. Excellent, higher end choices. \n\nRestaurants are really where the Biltmore shines with delicious options at a variety of a price points. If you are looking for healthy, go with True Food. Fast and convenient, Paradise Bakery. A higher end treat, stop by Capital Grille. Tucked off in the corner is Stingray, which every sushi lover needs to try (get a bento box at lunch... So much food!). \n\nIt does bug me that you are not going to get good deals here. It seems like nothing is ever on sale. i went to lululemon for my wife and literally NOTHING was on sale. But then again, what do you expect when people are willing to pay the moolah?\n\nOverall I recommend it."
"""I was a little worried about this place, since it is in Fort Mill, it's called Capt. Steve's, and it was kind of cartoony.  To say I was very surprised when I actually started eating would be an under statement.  Nothing here was over fried, was fried nice and lightly.  I had the fried oysters, which were some of the best I've had, and yes, I live by the ocean.  Definitely worth the quick stop in, but beware of the crowds, they come in \""""schools\"""".  Haha!"""
"The only ice skating rink in Vegas!  If they didn't have this, my sanity from the summer heat would have been lost a long time ago."
I am a coffee snob and there is nothing wrong with that.  No five because yesterday they were out of half and half and decaf and took forever with order but usually they are great substitute if I run out if my own beans at home.  Have dog treats too!
"I was referred to Killman Automotive via a friend in 2008. Since then, I've brought all of my out-of-warranty repairs to them. Straight answers, few 'sales jobs' and a staff that knows their autos. In my opinion, that is a homerun."
It was good but our initial server was not pleasant or helpful.   Everyone else was wonderful and attentive. Therefore 3 out of 4 servers were worth out time.  Not happy to see shark fin on the menu though.
"""After trying to \""""play doctor\"""" for a nasty sinus infection, I finally gave in and went to Urgent Care. \n\nI arrived a little after 1:00 pm and they were pretty busy; but since I've been there before check in was fast, and the staff very friendly and apologetic for the wait time. \n\nI waited about 40 minutes before being seen, but they had quoted an hour and a half so I was happy. I saw Dr. Baker and she was fantastic! She listened to all my symptoms, didn't rush talking to me and explained my options for medications.

"""If you want real Chinese food then you probably should go to China. I've eaten what we Americans consider to be \""""Chinese food\"""" all across the country and it all pretty much has the same general flare to it. It's usually fried, comes with a side of duck sauce and gives you a stomach ache afterwords. Mandarin Gourmet technically is no different then any other Americanized version of Chinese food however the service really sets it apart.\n\nI have been going here since college and never had bad service or bad food. The staff always is very friendly and sadly they recognize me when I come in. The prices are comparable to any other sit down Chinese establishment. \n\nThe best time to go is lunch. No matter how full the building is you will be out in 30 minutes and that's if you take your time. No matter what I've ordered I get my meal in minutes. It's kind of unbelievable.\n\nAll things considered I have no reason eat Chinese anywhere else downtown. While most Chinese food is pretty much the same this place really stands out."""
It is a cheap way to get your core done to transfer. Professors are people who often love their subject. There are other professors who are eeking out an existnce in quiet desperation.
"This place has a good mix of good and bad...\n\nThe Bad: Super rude female bartender who was working on the night of 11/21, she gave me nothing but attitude and made it seem like serving me was a burden to her. \n\nThe Good: On my second round, I got a nice guy who smiled, was attentive and fast at getting our round.  Well done!\n\nThe Bad: There wasn't enough stools for our table so I had to sit on a mini one... I felt pretty awkward.\n\nThe Good: We all got the Vintage burger and I have to say, it was probably one of the top 5 burgers I've ever had, everything about it was perfect. I almost gave this place three stars but because my gang and I all loved our food, I threw in another one for you."

EVER. I've eaten practically the entire menu and visited so often when I lived closer that they would put in my appetizer order before I even got a table. Many of my friends were introduced to this place by me, and when visiting from as far away as Alaksa would ask me to go there when in town.\n\nIf they do reopen somewhere else, I'll be 1st in line for some paper wrapped chicken!"
"First, a shameful admission. I don't like ice cream.\n\nThose previous five words have gotten me responses ranging from loathing to pity. Gelato, milkshakes, water ice, fro-yo, and other cold concoctions? Fine by me. But I'm utterly apathetic to ice cream. However, there is one, and only one, exception that I've tasted. The sole ice cream I will gladly seek out is Dave and Andy's.\n\nDave and Andy's creation hits all the high marks, from flavor to texture to temperature. The ice cream here truly tastes of what it's supposed to without being overwhelming. Everything has a malty backbone which adds a unique savory sweetness to each flavor. The ice cream here isn't served excessively cold, and the texture is creamy without slickness. The killer waffle cones are homemade and complement the malty sweetness of the flavors very well. Even the low fat yogurt is awesome.\n\nThe lines can get long, but they move fast. Prices are reasonable given the quality, but bring cash. They also make a mean ice cream cake. Stop by and see if it's worth the hype (spoiler alert: it is)."
"Oddly enough, I never shopped here when I was a student and lived in Madison, probably b/c I was on a pretty tight budget and I felt it cruel to torment myself and enter stores where I knew I would find a ton of cool stuff that I couldn't own...*tear*. \n\nFast forward to my working girl days, I finally stopped in here on a recent trip to Madison when everything was at least 30% off (I think they are moving locations or something)...score! My bf found some sweet deals on mountain climbing shoes AND a camelbak. Needless to say, he was pretty stoked! To top it off, the sales people were pretty nice, but, hey, that is to be expected of local Madison folk ;) Anyways, we both left big fans of this place although I don't know how I would feel if we weren't getting such good deals...hmmmm..."
"I was beyond surprised to see Bruster's as we were running errands for the day as I've only seen them in Georgia.  Regardless of the low temps and snow, I asked my cousin to go through drive thru to see if it was really as good as I remembered it to be.  They had roughly 15 flavors available and it was really hard to pick one.  I really wish that their board had a tiny blurb about each flavor if it was a mix or their own combo.  Like I was a bit surprised that my turtle scoop consisted of chocolate instead of vanilla ice cream as its base.  In any case, it was rich and creamy.  The scoop was gigantic.  It's a bit too sweet for my palette now but still, delicious ice cream."

"We tried pho, stir fried noodle and fried rice with pineapple. Frankly, the pho is not as what I expected. I tried several better pho inside and outside this area. The fried noodle is pretty tasty and the fried rice with pineapple is ok, but not a Thailand style. Actually, I prefer to giving it a 3.5 which I believe is more reasonable."
Well the parking lot sucks A**. Its always busy and people are going in every which direction. The store is laid out pretty well i guess. Love the 99 cent prices or 39 cent prices. Great selection of fruit and produce. The Refrigerated and Frozen section is always well stocked and its easy to find what your looking for. The candy is hit or miss as i bought some that was stale. Cant go wrong with 3 Liter sodas for 99 cents or when you need a last minute kitchen item.
"Oh how the high school Beehive memories come flooding back.

Walking into the restaurant threw me off a bit. There's no one at the door to tell you where to go so it took us a minute to realize we were suppose to seat ourselves. The bread they give you at the beginning is really good. The side salad was also really good especially with all of the cheese crumbles. We ordered the calamari diavolo and that was very good. My boyfriend ordered the 1/2 rack of lamb and he said it was amazing. I ordered the pasta Carmela. It was good but I wasn't overly impressed. For dessert I ordered the pumpkin tiramisu and again it was good but I wasn't overly impressed. My boyfriend got the dolce amore chocolate cake with berries which was pretty good. Overall it was a nice experience. The waiter was very friendly. It was a little more expensive than we normally spend on a night out but we were on vacation. We would probably stop in again if we were in the area.
"4.5 stars - minus .5 star for the east coast style service that might not be warm enough for the occasional west coast tourist.\n\nOtherwise, I have not found corned beef hash or hotcakes as good as what Pamela's serves here.\n\nThe strawberry hotcakes are filled with strawberries, brown sugar, and cream, and the crispy hotcake with an occasional brown sugar crunch is always more than satisfying. Then there's the corned beef hash that I dream of whenever I taste other kinds of hashes elsewhere. It looks simple and homely, but somehow it tastes heavenly.\n\nI always come here whenever I'm in town!"
"""I grew up in Phoenix. I am NOT an out of town visitor. I did not actually sleep at this hotel, but I did show an out of town friend the elevator view. \n\nMy friend made it all the way to the top before I discovered he doesn't like elevators. Obviously he's not a complainer. Poor guy. But the view is nice & the ride is fast & smooth. It was fun for me at least.\n\nWe made our way to the 2nd floor & looked at the statues scattered around posed doing trapeze tricks. They're like the ones outside the Herberger. These are taller & have animal heads though.\n\nI'd like to comment on Deb L's review. She'd like for the Hyatt to \""""Remodel to a contemporary look that embraces the southwest feel.\"""" Omg, NO! I've always thought of his downtown hotel as kind of swanky. I've been to the Compass Restaurant. Any cheesy Southwest decor would make this place revolting. I'm so tired of the overly used fake cowboy motif. Thank you Hyatt for trying to keep Phoenix at least semi-classy."""
"The only reason Marigold's doesn't have a higher rating is because you will most likely need to wait in a really long line before you order and are seated.\n\nOther than that, the food here is exceptional.  This is another organic local restaurant in Madison, but they specialize in Breakfast/Lunch.  The food really is exceptional. \n\nMost places I go to, I usually think what here can I make on my own for significantly less.  There are very few places that can have as simple menus as Marigold's but have a result of me saying, 'I really can't replicate this'.  The breakfast sandwich is astoundingly simple, delicious, and impossible to reproduce.  The cream sauce they put on it is just ridiculous.  They're really well known for their french toast, which is really good, but isn't as unique.  They're specialty duck confit hash is something you will never be able to have elsewhere and is absolutely delicious.\n\nOne big thing is don't be tricked into the orange juice.  It's expensive and the amount is so miniscule as to be laughable."
"""We used Presidential again this week to pick up my wife at the airport. I had a glitch trying to use the \""""web special\"""" order form on the website, because it was less than 24 hours before pickup. I called and was told how to get around that.

We are 2 for 2 with Presidential, it's definitely our go-to company for car service in Vegas."""
"had the new york pizza, and cheese bread. both pretty good. but not reeeeaallly good. a cool place to go for lunch or dinner, i always like places with out door seating."
We have been Pan China diners since they opened and the food has always been great but lately I have to say stay away from the egg rolls! A good egg roll is a wonderful thing but it seems they are using some frozen cardboardy things with very little filling. We've gotten to the point of picking up entrees here and our egg rolls at....wait for it....Jack-in-the-Box!
"This is a dangerous place.  I could eat so much of the food.  \n\nI had a mission though.  Use a coupon for buy sauce, get a pound of free fresh pasta.  Picking out the flavor of pasta was a tough choice, but the little lightning bolts denoting a favorite flavor made it a bit easier.  The final choice was garlic & rosemary linguini.  I made a quick decision on the sauce and went with the pomodoro to try something different then my normal marinara.  \n\nI couldn't resist a baguette.  The pasta, sauce and bread totaled to around $8 - a great price for an amazing dinner.\n\nThe pasta was just as delicious as I was expecting, the sauce was fun with a little kick and the bread was gone quickly.  \n\nGlad I decided to expand my bubble and check out Pasta & Provisions.  I definitely will be returning."
"Narrow aisles and not much for home decor like hobby lobby, but does the job when I need a craft fix."
"great church, I'm not into all the music that kicks off the service, it's typically a three song set 3- 5inutes a song, and I have bad knees and a surgically arthritic ankle and I would rather sit but everyone is standing and I would feel so guilty sitting. So my advise here is this is the time to show up 10-15 minutes after the service starts. I also love that they have services on Saturday (1600 and 1800 hours) Pastor Odor is great, prior to service he is always around for a quit chat either about Christ or the football scores. The services are not up-down-up-down-kneel-pray-bow- high-five. Very modern and up to date involving Christ with current day issues as well. If you believe in God and are the fence to start coming back to church I highly recommend coming here or Central Christian. You will fell welcome and get involve in the community outreach programs too."
"Certainly a nice place, but I booked this hotel through Priceline at more than 70% off the normal price. Definitely wouldn't pay full price, but I'm not sure if I'd ever pay that much for a hotel. TV is not HD and wifi is $10 a day. \n\nGreat location, near downtown arenas, lightrail and the airport.\n\nAlso, if you stay here on the weekend, I'd recommend finding street parking as we did, rather than paying $19 to park in the hotel garage. We found a spot just a few blocks away."
"You know the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld? I like to keep that in mind when I do my Yelp reviews because, while the rating system is a simple one to five stars, you really aren't reviewing all restaurants on the same variables. \n\nDiamond's needs to be rated amongst authentic discount Chinese food restaurants. I give it four stars with the understanding that Diamond's is not:\n\n- romantic\n- a place to meet my girlfriend's parents for the first time\n- charming\n\nIs it authentic? Maybe. How would I know? I can say that it's a value where you get a lot of good for an inexpensive price. The decor isn't impressive but they don't claim it is. Specials are written on florescent poster board lining the restaurant. \n\nService is slow and inconsistent though -- so less a star. But I stand firm that, if you like Chinese food and you are hungry, then this is the place to go."
"""Have you ever read the book (or seen the film) \""""Alive\""""? You know, where the rugby team crashes in the Andes, and while freezing to death, they are forced to eat their dead in order to survive?\n\nWell, I think that rugby team should probably have just brought along Piper's Pub's Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie. Because it is the absolute perfect winter meal, and then they could've avoided that whole cannibalism thing. \n\nFor only about $10 at Piper's, you'll get a huge, hearty serving of the most rich, flavorful, lamb stew you've ever had, topped with crispy potatoes, and filled with even more. This one delicious, piping-hot bowl will sustain you for days. If you eat the whole thing, I promise you won't even have any room left for the guy who was sitting in 7C."""
"I've bought many a book in this quaint little store.  The minute you walk in you're bombarded with intimidating stacks and bookcases piled with numerous books that you probably never heard of and will never even develop the interest of reading.\n\nI usually make a beeline for the fiction section located downstairs, this is probably where I spend most of my time moseying around Craig street. I usually scour this place for their cheap and interesting books. I usually find something located on the smallest bookcase in the middle of the fiction basement.  \n\nOverall, I got to say I'm a huge fan of this place."
"Ive had the most popular bobby, I didnt like it. It has all the components I liked, excited, but it didnt taste good. I ate my boyfriends cheese steak instead with the added onion,  mushroom, and jalepano. It was tasty. They have three different sizes. They can come pretty large so perfect to share. We have over our many visit also tried the meatball sub but the best is still the philly. The staff is really nice, service was quick, will definitely be coming back."
"Order the bbq chicken taco's with mango salsa. \n\nTry not to hit them up right at noon, go a bit earlier or later."
"Napoli tries to put itself into the famous Pittsburgh pizza competition against Aiello's and Mineo's, but it falls short, save one standard: it looks damn good. In the end, however, it will always place as shameful, shameful bronze. Here's what is best about Napoli: its cheese, which tastes exactly the same as the other two (same cheese seller?), and the crust is chewy, too. But the sauce is rather flavorless, though a little sweet.\n\nDon't get me wrong. This excellent pizza, and it destroys 95% of all other pizza in the universe. But in Pittsburgh, it only wins the consolation match."
"The bowls are great, but the specials aren't that good. If you want a good teriyaki chicken with vegis white or brown rice then it's pretty good place. They've gotten a little cheap on the cups and plates lately, hope they change back.\n\nStill nice people and quick service."
"This dark moody bar has more character in a square inch than FIVE Scottsdale bars have altogether.  Quite simply stated -- they just don't make bars like this anymore.  Chez Nous oozes bar noir cool - with the patterned neo-gothic wallpaper, 70s light fixtures, plush leather booths, and a weathered old-school sensibility.  I don't know why I haven't reviewed this yet either - having been several times.\n\nA small group of us bid farewell this past weekend to the 7th Ave/Indian School charmer of a bar that was Chez Nous.\n\nI'm gonna go out on a limb here, but in my several trips here I've found this to be the most ethnically diverse crowd one can find at an Arizona bar -- all mingling, drinking stiff drinks and dancing to 70s funk and soul in harmony (cue cheesy sappy music here).\n\nI hope the character of this bar and mix of regulars stays intact - something I worry about since it's moving to the gentrifying Roosevelt arts district in August."
"""Yep, I see the reviewer before me used the phrase \""""hidden gem.\"""" I'm a little pissed, since that's the phrase I wanted to use. We went to eat here with friends last night, and I was impressed by the food, the service, and the environment for somewhere that looked like such a hole-in-the-wall. \n\nI ordered the Szechuan Eggplant, and it was really good. There was plenty on the plate, too, so I took leftovers to work today for lunch. The couple who took us there wanted the spicy green beans, and although the restaurant had sold out of green beans, the manager went to the Harris Teeter around the corner to grab some for us. Even with the little hiccup, the food was ready quick, and it was all delicious.\n\nMy only complaint is that the vegetarian selection is a little skimpy...there were 3 or 4 things on the menu, which isn't bad, but usually a Chinese restaurant will have lots of options."""
"""I have been coming to Marigold for years and this was going to be a five-star review, but they made a recent, disturbing change--they switched from Anchora coffee to Alterra. Before you get up in arms, yelling, \""""I love Alterra,\"""" let me explain that Alterra is not a bad coffee, it's just that I loved the Anchora Marigold Special Blend. We would buy this blend and give it away to friends and family as presents.\n\nI can understand making the change, and I will still LOVE Marigold, but now that I don't get my Marigold rocket fuel anymore, I will be a little less excited about going there.\n\nAs usual the food was excellent.

Our party of six was in and out in under an hour.\n\nIf you aren't looking for fancy, and in the neighborhood, I definitely would recommend you visit.

I seriously wish all of these theaters would do something about their popcorn. There should be a constant fresh batch instead of combining it all with the older stuff.

He could probably calm down a rabid dog and get into their mouth, as he had the patience of a saint with me. He took all the time I needed to go over everything and address all my concerns.

"I know: de gustibus non est disputandum, but having lived in Thaliand for a very long time, this place is the closest to authenticity you will ever get this side of the Mississippi. Portions are americanized cause no self-respecting thai will ever be caught dead or alive with a full plate of anything in front of her/him to finish all alone, preferring rather the choice of a number of small dishes from fish to beef washed down with fresh veggies - taste and eat -play with a group of people (as they lovingly say in thai), and apart from one busy evening where the hostess was annoyingly pedantic and going on about the benefits of calling up front to make a reservation, I simply love this place. Sticky rice, beef jerky and somtam will take you straight to a new level of awareness. Haven't tried the other branches, but the Rainbow/Lake Mead is a culinary retreat. Great service every time."

It's kind of like a cross between a New York pizza's thin crust with Chicago's love of calories.

The staff member told me I should have bought the covers so they could put the covers on the foam for me, if would probaby be difficult for me.; this was on Saturday. On Monday morning at 8:00am, I took in the covers of the sofa and chair, for 3 seats and 3 pillows, dropped them off and they were ready for me by 12:00 noon.  Excellent, excellent work; price was amazing.  You can't go wrong!"

"It was located right in the midst of the Asian district. I was not expecting to find decent barbers here nor in Las Vegas. I have already stopped by a few barbershops but nothing appetizing.\n\nI did not pay attention to this place in the past. But after a long day of barber shopping, I peeked into the shop here and it's not too busy. One stylist was eager to get me on immediately. But I prefer old fashion barbers usually for their old school experience. And they are the dying breed.\n\nI had Joe and he did a great job from the get go. I could feel the confidence within a minute. He was a bit rough with eccentric attitude but it's fine with me.\n\nSo hairies, I like it and I will return to Joe. It's $12 for Flat Top."
"This is really bad, I been eating here for the last 3 days. It's soo good and addicting. What make it even harder for me to resist is, I work not even a 1/2 block away. Nooooo I DONT work at Leather & Lace. Even if I was, they will fire me because I'm heading to looking like a balloon. Last 3 days, I had the Mr. K's 1/4 lbs cheeseburger on white bun, grill onions and lettuce. Very simple burger yet juicy and nicely done. I totally agreed w.Jimmy D. on the time it took to bring me my food. However, that I don't mind because my burger alway come hot and bother. Fries are hot and crispy.

"My regular Madison hangout between classes and after school was probably most frequented because it was also the regular hangout of most of the hottest bizzels in town.  However, I did generate one intelligible thought here that occured to me one especially cold and fine winter day: that the severe weather sure does have a humbling effect on the people and culture in the midwest.  Sure, in California we have periodic episodes such as earthquakes and fires, but those are rare events, not regularly re-occuring.  Unlike anything we will ever experience here, we don't know what inclement weather really means.  The Midwest's version of Mother Nature is brutal - engraved into your subconscious memory year after year after year - forcing every single soul to bundle up, huddling together in the same boat during those harsh winter months (vicious even in the summer, with the severe thunder storms, lightening and flash flooding).  A sense of humility and environmental determinism unknown to us Californians is the result."
"""I am grateful to Matthews Animal Clinic.  I have a rescue puppy that my neighbor was unable to keep.  I needed a fecal exam done to treat her for parasites.  The clinic in my area refused to even test her stool without performing an exam, which was $42.00.  I knew she had round worms and if that was all, I could RX it over the counter.  The fecal would have told if she had other parasites, and then an exam and Dr.'s RX would have been necessary.    Matthews Animal Clinic gladly tested her stool for me, and all she had were roundworms.  This saved me over $40.00 on a rescue pup.  With the economy the way it is, a lot of people can no longer rescue.  Things like this help so much with the finances and potentially help save more dogs and cats.

"Met a friend for brunch there this morning; we were a little on the early side for a Saturday morning, arriving about 9:30.  By the time we left, the place was full and there was a wait at the counter.  \n\nI had coffee and the biscuits/gravy with eggs and field greens for $10.95, my friend ordered the breakfast sandwich for $5.95.  Frankly, my meal was overpriced, and wasn't of sufficiently higher quality to justify the additional charge over, say, Denny's.  I'm not opposed to paying for atmosphere or creative and fresh cooking; this just wasn't special enough, IMO.  My friend's sandwich, on the other hand, was tremendous- on ciabatta with eggs, tomato, applewood bacon, etc.  I'd definitely order that again.\n\nIt's great that they serve Ancora coffee- a definite plus in my book.  It's family-friendly, but the kids there were generally well-behaved- also another plus.  Didn't feel rushed and the decor is comfortable."
"My how you've grown since I last visited you Biltmore Fashion Plaza. You now have more fancy stores and the parking situation is a nightmare. The girl that validated our parking token actually said the designers of the lot were very smart as they made it very easy for patrons to lose those little round poker style chips, and end up having to pay the max fee for parking. Well, if your shopping at the Biltmore Fashion plaza you can most likely afford to pay for that lost token but why risk it? Valet your car. \n\nTumi, Lululemon, Saks, Apple, are some of the shops here. It's a beautiful setup with a nice open feel and very posh and clean. The lush lawn in front of Julia Bakers chocolate shop and Saks serves as a spot for the  free community movie nights where the proprietors of the plaza bring out a big screen and project movies for all to enjoy. Picnicking people spread out on blankets and chairs over the lawn. What a charming scene!"

"I was back here over the holidays and I feel like I really needed to update this review to distinguish my previous rating about the food and the beer. First off, once again I tried several of their beers. Their rotating stout was a chocolate-mint and I found the mint flavor absolutely undesirable. I also tried a seasonal brown and was thoroughly disappointed. However, they did have a bottle-only IPA (the Thunderhop) that was drinkable. But once again, I would rate the beer  2 or 3 stars.\n\nHowever, the food was absolutely phenomenal. We started with the hummus (good) and the spinach, feta, and smoked Gouda dip (phenomenal). Then for my lunch, I had, literally, the best French onion soup of my life. For anyone that makes it to the Church Brew Works I cannot say enough that you MUST TRY THE FRENCH ONION SOUP.  I also tried the nontraditional pierogies, which, were a green chile, cheddar and chorizo. These too were excellent.\n\nSo overall, the beer is a bust but the atmosphere and food make this place worth of a rating bump."

OMG *faints* 2 1/2 yrs in Vegas and this was my first time coming here which I wish would've been waaay sooner. I just left from here and I guess it gets pretty busy on Saturdays so be prepared to wait. I believe I waited around 45 minutes-1 hr but boy was it worth it! The prices were actually pretty cheap compared to other bbq places and they actually give you your money's worth. While waiting in line they gave us cold bottles of water and when we got our order we got an extra free peach cobbler for the wait. This food was by far the best bbq I've had in Vegas. I had the pulled pork dinner with mac & cheese and baked beans with peach cobbler for dessert. Everything was sooo fulfilling and scrumptious and the portions were BIG.  Everybody was friendly and I enjoyed the classic r&b songs they played while we were waiting. I'll definitely be back to get my fix in the future.

I wasn't sure they'd even let me in, but the manager happened to come by and immediately stopped to help me.

I'd rate the food very good, with maybe a few shortcomings because we were there on a very busy Saturday night.  The spinach salad which was supposed to be a comforting warm was lukewarm at best.  And a steakhouse that runs out of baked potatoes?  However, the venison I had as an entree was excellent.  I'll definitely go back to check out their late night menu which was recommended to us by several people in town.  And to try the pineapple upside-down cake!"

This is definitely a hot dog joint that's been around for a while and has resisted change it's entire life. Frankie's is a hot dog joint and that's all you're going to get. The hot dogs?

I do not eat steak so I ordered off their other menu which was a order slip listing what was for dinner. I had fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. It was eerily close to a frozen dish but you know what, it's $2.00 so who the hell cares. I was there to drink, not eat. Don't go in with huge food expectations.

"A+++ customer service. I took in my daughter's stroller, one of the three-wheeled jogging ones, because the front tire had come off the axle. I didn't know what else to do, and the tire looked like a small version of a bicycle tire, so I figured I'd give it a shot. The guys in the service area were great. They didn't blink when I explained the problem and that I didn't know where else to go. The took the tire apart, realized that the bearings were shot and went to work trying to figure out what size they were. They were able to determine the size, locate two of them in the shop and had the old ones popped out and the new ones pressed in in about 20 minutes. Total cost was around $30! This was a $200+ stroller that the manufacturer couldn't service. Without their help, it was probably going in the trash. \n\nI can't comment about the bikes they sell (I'm not a bike guy), but I know good service when I see it. When my daughter graduates from the stroller to a bike, BikeSource is where we'll be going."
"When I do get coffee or the urge for caffine, I'd probably pick Caribou over those other chains.  I still haven't really found a homey mom and pop corner coffee shop, but I haven't exactly been looking that hard either.\n\nThis location is pretty convenient and the people are nice - not a huge location so it seems like there are always people here.  May be hard when you come and it's busy to get a table/place to sit.\n\nI happened to wander in after having a hearty meal at Chipotle next door.  Good way to cap the dinner off... unfortunately I was wired for the rest of the night.  A+ on the effective caffeine content of your coffee.... F for me for not being smart and drinking coffee after dinner on a Sunday night.   Monday was quite a long day after a sleepless night.  Fail on my part."
They have a robot that makes cappuccinos.  'Nuff said.
"Wow - arcane bolts and nuts, pulleys, and piano hinges that would make a lowes cringe - yeah we got those.\n\nMan store is correct, this place has whatever you can think over crammed in ceiling to floor aisle after aisle.  \n\nLittle bit confusing on pricing - not marked on a lot of items.\n\nWhile quite a distance drive for me, I make it a point to swing by here often (plus the breakfast/lunch restaurant next door is good)."
"I've now been to this X.O. Liquor twice as it is the closest liquor store to my house. No, I am not a booze hound! The first time I needed banana liquer for cupcakes I was making, but unfortunately they were all out, although the employee there was nice enough to look around and even make a suggestion for 99 Bananas. I didn't want the people eating my cupcakes to get totally smashed though, so I opted out of that one.\n\nHowever, this past Super Bowl Sunday I was in need of Chambord at a last minute decision to put the delicious liquor into my margaritas I was making. Lucky me, they had Chambord, for a decent price and also offered the smaller size bottle and the bigger bottle. I opted for the smaller one.\n\nStaff is always friendly and helpful. It is in a kind of skeezy area right off the freeway. But just power through that area into the store. Oh PS - I would NOT come here if it were not light out and NO I am NOT joking about that fact."
"Yes, the owner of this shop is a bit curt and unwelcoming.  And the turnaround time on some of the items is not the fastest.  However, the work I've had done there -- by both the owner and her employee -- has always been very well done and sturdy.  I recommend this shop!"
"I was locked out of my son's apartment. I lost the key somewhere in the blding. could not find it. Called Bill's Key shop, and it was just about 6:00 pm. Someone arrived within 10-15 mins. had the door unlocked within minutes. All was good! The gentleman was very nice, didn't take advantage of the situation. I had asked for charge up front to know what I was getting into, and he stuck to his price. Hopefully you won't need their service, but if you do, rest assured you are in good hands!"
"Conclusion:\n  Bypass everything else and go here. Don't waste your time, it's a no-brainer.  If it was a little closer to work I would come here every other day at least (I wouldn't say that about any other place)\n\nRundown:\n-Neighborhood is sketchy (no offense)\n-DRIVE-THRU!!!\n-Phenomenal Food\n-A little pricey for random mexican place but worth every penny\n-Phenomenal Food\n-Not near the strip\n-Not for the tourista\n-Cost/Benefit skewed far towards benefit\n\nDetail/Context:\n  Moved to Vegas recently and showed up here with my buddy at the insistence of a local (we came by the day before but it was closed around 10PM)  We walked in and ordered instantly (lucky?)\n\n  2xCarne asada burritos and a carne quesadilla, OMG the flavor was perfect, the ingredients were fresh and the meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  We were sad we couldn't eat more.\n\n  I can't wait to go back"
"Reliable, felt safe - no winos or pervs probably b/c the driver was strict. Bus was comfy. Lost a star b/c expensive even with Memorial Union RT discount from Madison to O'Hare and no wifi. Had to pee fast at brief Janesville stop. Current pickup/drop off location at Chazen at UW. Slight trek in O'Hare going from Terminal 3 to Bus area in Terminal 2. O'Hare is NOT friendly for those without a ticket - buy food before leaving terminal for Bus pickup area."
"The waffles were good and sweet, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was down to earth.  The only real drawback and it is a drawback, is we had to wait outside for a good twenty minutes in the late summer afternoon.  There is not waiting room and if the place is full when you get there you have to wait out on the sidewalk."
"""It has been way too long since I have been out to a driving range. As I drove up to Leatherman's, I was surprised to see how large it is. There is a two level driving range with two areas (one on either side) reserved for instructions. \n\nThere are two putting ranges as well. The putt-putt course is nothing to talk about. \n\nWe bought a large bucket of balls ($15) and it had approximately 105 in it. You dump the balls in this area where you'll hit from and it automatically saves you from having to tee up each time. Auto-teer. Nice!\n\nGreat place! Close to Renaissance Park and golf course.

"I took my wedding dress to Anna's to have a bustle put in about one week before my wedding because I'm a procrastinator. Other places told me it would take 2-4 weeks but Anna's accommodated my timeline and had it done in two days! She also noticed that my dress was a little long on me, which was distressing because it is lace and can't really be hemmed on short notice. The owner took the time to talk to me and suggested adding in another layer of tulle while shortening the inner layers to make it easier to walk in the dress. When I picked up the dress, it was even more beautiful with the fuller flared skirt. She noticed a small tear in the lace over my zipper (which had been caused by a seamstress somewhere else who claimed it already looked like that) and had her most experienced seamstress sew it up for free! I am incredibly happy with the service and personalized attention I received at Anna's and will definitely be going back for future alterations."
"I'm sure this not the healthiest place you eat at, but closest you get to the perfect fried chicken.... While eating, the last thing i cared about was the healthy part of the food... Tried the 3 pc chicken smothered with gravy and onion and waffles (Not to mention the butter and syrup on the waffle), I know sounds absolutely crazy but an absolute heaven.... Have to try the gravy, always cooked right..love the hot sauce, great flavors."
"The decor is nothing special, probably the coffee sort of sucks and the AC is not quite high enough, but who cares: if you are vegan and have been missing out of your sweet friend the doughnut this this the place to go. Lots to choose from; it was worth the $18 cab charge to-and-from the Strip for the $5 box of sweet little friends for my wife and I."
"""\""""Oh no,\"""" I first thought. The man with the scissors and the customer in the chair were a few generations ahead of me. The place was dead on a Saturday afternoon.\n\n\""""Should I have trusted all the Yelp reviews,\"""" I wondered.\n\nYES! I slipped out of Reece's chair with the best hair cut I've had in years. He gave me the exact cut I was looking for. A hidden gem next to the now-closed Healthy Home Market.\n\nI walked in with a shaggy mess. I walked out with a great look. I only wish I found this place sooner after so many hit and miss visits to Great Clips.\n\nA basic clean-up and trim came with a warm gel and razor shave of my neck. I walked in without an appointment and was out in under an hour. Probably best to make an appointment, but walk-ins will get what they're looking for.\n\nGo while you can! Reece says he'll be in business through November when the shopping center redevelopment will push him out. I hope he finds a new place nearby to set up shop.\n\n$18 for a basic men's cut.

"WALGREENS PHARMACY DEPT.\n\nI was at the location to fill a prescription. First time was a breeze. I called my prescriptions in for a refill and attempted to pick them up few days later, I ran into problems. The pharmacy-assistants kept informing me to come back because they were having some problems with my worker's comp insurance. The 3rd time I went back to the pharmacy, I spoke to a different person. She also ran into the same problem with my worker's comp insurance but was very patient and thorough that she was able to resolve what the other assistants were not able to do. After a month of going back and forth, I was finally able to fill my prescriptions and went home a happy camper! THANK YOU Ms. SOSHEE!!!"

But when the average price that I could see on the shelf was over $100...that's pricey.\n\nWhat amazed me most, though, was the customer service.  The associate helping us gave us our space, but regularly checked in.  When we were headed to the register, she met us to take our items and escorted us to the register and acted as liaison with the cashier, and made sure we left with her card and a coupon for next time.  Definitely made the trip!"""
"A basic oil change is a basic oil change. The dealerships are not going to do a better job than me changing it myself.............But I'm lazy and I like convenience.\n\nAfter completing paperwork, I was out of here in 20 minutes, tops. My filthy carpets were vacuumed and they didn't try to sell me any unncessary maintenance such as a transmission or radiator fluid flush like other places would. \n\nAn extra $10 for tire rotations though - not so hot. But thats not why I come here. When I have the time, the best part about Speedee is that its located right next to gamestop. =)"

Aaargh!  They were OUT of winter melon buns!  At least they still make them.
"The food is good, portions are small if you're doing family style. If you're looking for a place that serves chicken balls in pineapple sauce, DON'T come here. I only say that, bec. there was a family at the next table to me complaining about their food to the waiter. There was nothing wrong w/ their food, but I think they thought it was going to be something else. \n\nOne caveat. When someone says that Rose Tea Cafe has the best bubble tea in Pittsburgh, that doesn't mean much. If you like the bubble teas made from powdered mixes, you might like it. However, I prefer fresh fruit juice bubble teas, which no one in Pittsburgh seems to do."
"I don't understand the negative comments earlier posters have made. I've been eating here since the day they opened and have always been very pleased (and now very glad they have doubled in size). Yes, a couple of their waitresses aren't the friendliest but they are always busy and it is not a big deal for me.\n\nI used to live in the Vietnamese section of Garland/Richardson, Texas and had 10 Vietnamese restaurants within 4 miles of my house and the Pho, Bun and Spring Rolls here are the equal of anything I had in Texas. My only complaint is I wish the Bun was a little larger.\n\nThere is a reason they are always busy. When I have friends in from out of town, this is always the restaurant I recommend."
"I recently purchased a high mileage used Jeep Liberty. A few weeks after buying, the oil pressure light came on. \n\nFearing the worst (and most expensive), I started searching for repair shops online. Sun Valley Automotive had very high reviews and were located very near my home, so I decided to give them a chance. \n\nI'm exceedingly glad that I did. They were honest from the start, they had my car finished when they said they would, and best of all, didn't try to upsell me or do more than was actually needed. Instead of replacing parts, as I dreaded, I got out the door with a cleaned oil sensor and an oil change, for under $140. They also offer $15 gift cards if you spend over $100. \n\nIt was overall a very good experience (not something you'd expect from a trip to the mechanic) and I'll be back for any and all future vehicle maintenance."
"One of the problems I have with Yelp is that if one was to base their dining choices solely off it, they'd miss out on great places like East Blvd.\n\nSome of the best bar and grill food in Charlotte. The mozzarella sticks, quesedillas, nachos, black bean burger, and home fries are particularly good.\n\nPlus, if you come a couple times you'll start being treated like family."
"Going to a home improvement store isn't exactly something I love to do.  It usually involves work once you leave.  That being said, this Home Depot does make it about as painless as possible to get in and out as any I've been to.  \n\nThe location is so obscure that I don't think many people come here so that makes it very easy to get in, get what you need and get out without a lot of hassle."
"""Seems my review differs from many of the earlier ones from previous years. I needed a suit pressed and a shirt laundered and pressed. Suit came back nice and proper.

Food was delish! Loved every last bite of my fine dinner. Sadly I read everyone's reviews and see why they would get a bad rating...but not because of the food....the dinning area is really dated and needs improvement.
"I did a lot of research in to limo options for the trip from McCarran to The Mirage on my last Vegas trip. Seems that, like Vegas in general, there are a lot of scumbags out there willing to take you for a ride. Between online reviews and a coworkers recommendation, I decided on Presidential Limo.\n\nThis was a great choice. Our flight was a bit late, but our drive was there waiting for us, with the sign and a luggage cart, and our one-hour didn't start until we actually got there. He helped with the luggage, took us to the car, popped the champagne, loaded the bags, and took us on our way (via a liquor store). The price was very fair, the service was fantastic. \n\nHighly recommended."
"On a trip from New Jersey to South Carolina with my daughter the engine started to smoke and the low coolant light came on. Stopped at Fort Mill Automotive were the mechanic checked our car, and found nothing wrong and refused to accepted any payment or even a tip for his time.

"Today was one of those days where I look in the fridge at my frozen dinners.. Then I look in the cabinets at my cans of soup... and say f*ck it. I'm going to try something new. \nEnter Jimmy Johns. In GA, they just recently started opening shops, but none of them where near enough to where I lived and worked for me to actually try it. \nFirst off, the website is awesome. Their nutrition calculator lets you choose the toppings, add/subtract things from the sandwich, and even choose a lettuce wrap instead of bread. It gives you the complete nutrition info, instead of just calories. Yay!\nI got the country club unwich (lettuce wrap) with turkey and ham, and sat patiently waiting for the delivery boy. The delivery time said somewhere between 11 and 11:30; the boy showed up at 11:02. Nice!\nThe sandwich was delicious, despite it's lack of bread, and super healthy.. because of the lack of bread. \nOh, and it's cheap! 6.50 for the sandwich, plus whatever yout tip. \nWill definitely order from them again."
"I still love the food here, but frankly we most often eat at the East side location.  I recently had a http://restaurant.com certificate for this location, though, so we made the trek over.  I was not pleased with the way my certificate was handled- they shorted the credit by a few dollars, and when challenged, had some goofy excuse. Not sure how, but three reasonable adults still racked up a bill over $68 before tip and AFTER a $25 coupon.  I also didn't like that the gin and tonic I ordered was $7 each- for RAIL gin!"
"Last time I checked, the unofficial definition of a Thrift Store is a place with unexpected/mystery inventory involving questionably clean items - and that's exactly what this place is.\n\nThis Salvation Army is huge with two levels. Tons of miscellaneous crap, furniture and an entire 2nd floor dedicated to clothing.\n\nLike all T-Stores this place can be hit-or-miss, but I just about always walk out with something. My past trip proved especially fruitful.\n\nFor around $20 I got 7 or 8 shirts including a PITT basketball jersey, a cool vintage blanket that I could resell to a Brooklyn hipster for $75 and some nicknacks including a 12 inch bust of Jesus Christ and a bowling themed coffee mug."
"43rd Express is the definition of a hole in the wall place. The outside looks less appealing, the inside even less, but then the food comes out and you are oh so glad to be there. We ordered the steak pho and a pork dish that came with the broken rice, a sunny side up egg, and something else we couldn't really identify. It tasted a little fishy... not sure what it was, I wasn't a fan, but my husband seemed to enjoy it. \n\nThe pho broth was very flavorful and came with fresh basil and bean sprouts. The portion was more than enough and prices where very reasonable. \n\nDon't forget to check in and get your free drink. I ordered the fresh orange juice, which in fact was fresh with pulp and seed. My husband got the fresh lemonade, which was very tasty as well."

"I took our two cats here to get them clipped short for the summer.  Cats, as anyone knows, can be difficult critters with which to work.  It can be difficult living in the same household at times, too!  \n\nWhen I got a recommendation for Misti-Sue, I called and made the appointment.  She's a very pleasant woman.  She works well with the pets in her care and does an excellent job.\n\nFor the last three years, I had the cats groomed at one of the major pet food chains.  They always came home somewhat traumatized by the experience.  One groomer dropped the one cat when she didn't have the pet carrier closed correctly and the cat almost went running through a store with lots of dogs on leashes.\n\nMisti-Sue's work is first!  I won't hesitate to return to have her groom the youngins again."
"When you go to Cricket Arena, it feels a little like traveling back through time. The arena is just so old-school and 70s feeling. Sadly, the area around the Arena is pretty depressing and crappy. I went to Cricket to see the Charlotte Roller Girls' first hometown roller derby bout. It was awesome. There was a huge turnout, and Cricket was a pretty good venue because they could easily convert the main floor to a flat derby track. Definitely go to a Roller Girls bout. They're a lot of fun."
"So its go big or go home, and I am going BIG. I was in the market for alterations for my wedding dress, and since I bought it over a year ago and in Texas I was a little conserved about where I should go to get it done. I mean I couldn't take it to say Davids Bridal because I hadn't purchased it there. So that being said I yelped it and I was pointed in this direction. \n\nI was expecting to pay big, very big the dress was a size 14 and I am a size 10 so I imagined I would be spending at least $600 (my best friend had spent over $1000 on her alterations) I also needed a bustle and to have it taken in as  I'm super short. Called and made my appointment went in and they got down to business! Two sessions was all it took at probably 20 mins each, they took it in added my bustle AND found a cheaper more cost effective way to hem the dress. I spent $233. I can honestly say it looks better then when I bought it!!"
"This place is a favorite secret indulgence for me but only if I stay to my scheduled routine: patio seating, capital tap beer, porta salad, garibaldi sandwich.  Everything else on the menu is not as good and better purchased at Delitalia, where its cheaper and you have the freedom to go home and eat it while watching Dexter on the couch.  Seriously, people."
"This Giant Eagle is a small version of the chain.  Not as much selection as other Giant Eagles as you may expect.  They also tend to be pretty busy.\n\nMy experiences with their customer service has been OK.  My questions have been answered accurately and in a professional manner.  Not a bad, smaller neighborhood store.\n\nThey always seem to have plenty of parking."
"Well, since my previous review of Mineo's, I left Pittsburgh and returned a few months ago.  I gave them another try and I must change my prior assessment of their pizza.  I don't know if they've changed how they make it, but the problems I listed before weren't so apparent this time.  I still wouldn't say they make the best pizza in Pittsburgh, but it is definitely good."
"My wedding dress, ordered from Australia, was two sizes too big, in addition to needing shortening and some other nips and tucks. Christie knows exactly how clothing is put together, and made it look perfect. The price for all the alterations seemed slightly steep, but I've never had clothes altered before so I didn't know what to expect; they may be in line with industry standards, especially since I had to have so many things done, and a wedding dress has a somewhat complicated construction to deal with (i.e. boning etc). \n\nChristie made me look great, and business was hopping with other customers who indicated they were repeat visitors, both when I was dropping my dress off and picking it up, so I know she has clients who come back to her over and over. Count me as one of them, now. I have a new dress that needs the straps fixed, and I know exactly who I'm taking it to."
"I have heard good things about this shop.  I had a bad experience at the east side Midas many years ago when the repairman tried to sell me something I did not need.  That was over 20 years ago so I decided to give them another try.   See how long it takes for a bad experience to wear off!  Was it really worth the hard sell to have to wait this long for me to come back?\nBut they did a good job for me.   No hard sell, in fact just the opposite.  When they could have they were polite and helpful.  The man at the front desk was excellent.  He is an example of the sort of professional that I want to help me for maintenance work.\nThey did take longer than they said it would.  It ended up taking twice as long as they first quoted me.  So I was disappointed in that.  Still the time was not terrible for what I had done.\nKeep up the good work.  I will be back."
Gem in the ruff.  Yes it's old very old. Probably like 30 years old.  I would come here as a boy with my grandfather.   But if you ask for an off the line hand wash they do it the right way and it's fast.  Not like Freddie's fabulousness which is just a scam for let me try to sell you everything under the sun.  This is like an old barber shop no frills just a good hand wash.
"I don't live near this restaurant and I stopped in thinking that it was the same restaurant as the Yummy Sushi on Sunset in Henderson. Wrong! In a good way.\n\nThis place is not that big, but looks very nice inside. We chose to sit at the sushi bar and the chef was very nice and knowledgable about all of the items they had to offer. I was surprised to see the substantial list of live items available that day.\n\nAll of the sushi we had was very fresh and tasty. We were not there during any special or happy hour and the price was perfectly reasonable.\n\nIt's a shame this restaurant is almost 45 minutes from my house or I would come back here all the time."
"I ate here for the first time last year. Any place where you can get RED KOOL AID DRANK is okay in my book. I had the chicken and waffles, why try anything else on the first visit? Would be nice if they offered a nap room for the post meal food coma. This will knock you on your ass."
"The pizza would be a 3 star in my pizza rankings, but the friendly staff, great prices, and homey atmosphere earn this place a star bump. I was pretty disappointed in my lunch special pizza. I've been to NYC quite a bit, eaten a LOT of NY pizza and folks this aint it ! I did love the family vibe, and they treated me so well - I just wish the pizza was better. It was like warmed over mall food court type stuff. It *does* remind me of the food court pizzas I've eaten while in the city (Villa pizza in NYC comes to mind), but nothing special. I need to make it over there again beacuse clearly I caught them on a bad day, but unfortunately it's been a month and I still can't bring myself to go back !"
"When a place has horrible service but wonderful food, what's the user review tipping etiquitte? I don't want to rave about the food because I was so embittered by the laisse fare attitude of our waiter, who - nonetheless-was serving the whole dining room.So what if it was bad for me...I would highly recommend the food and the atmosphere, just not the waiter we had at the moment we had him. Greens n beans were delicious. My friends got prosciutto and pea openne - excellent! Chicken parm was incredible. Sauces are fabulous. Seafood bisque was so buttery. Sharpsburg scares me, but this place is great!"
"Another FedEx that I feel obligated to write a review on due to the fact that I'm here at least once a week.

What I can tell you about this FedEx is that they have some of the nicest people working here. Every time I'm here, I'm greeted as soon as I walk in and there's rarely ever a long wait. They are also very efficient. After living here about 3 years, I've learned which FedEx Centers to go to around town.  If in Henderson, it's the one located off Sunset. If in North Las Vegas, it's the one located off Craig and Jones. And if in Summerlin, it's this one that I go to.

"I got my hair permed here, and unfortunately it didn't turn out the way I wanted it - I've had my hair permed before and loved it, so I definitely had expectations. For whatever reasons, it just didn't take the first time. \n\nBut: when I called back, they were very accommodating and fit me in for a re-do two weeks later. Jody was my stylist both times, and it looks wonderful now. I will be back, especially because it's conveniently close to my office.\n\nIt's average Aveda prices - obviously a little pricey but totally worth that Aveda smell ;) And, I love that it's had the same owners for over 20 years.

Had to get a recharger for my a/c that gave out on my way home. Read the reviews for this store and decided to stop by regardless that it was out of my way. The manager...Edgar or something very similar (I'm sorry buddy!)...but he went above and beyond to go out and help me out in the parking lot. Found out I had a bad compressor but still...the manager there is a wonderful guy. I'm just so sorry I forgot your name! Driving without a/c made me forgetful but he deserves all the praise in the world. Fellow yelpers led me to this specific store and I wasn't disappointed with the service they all gave thumbs up for. There are 2 autozones closer for me to go to but will gladly drive just a bit further and give my business to that store because of that manager. Good job and excellent service!
"Usually good food, great drinks, loud but ok service. Today.... Well, we'll see."
"I own a shop that builds high performance sports cars.  I don't have an alignment rack so Joe and Tony get all of my work.  Let's put it this way, if (for some reason) you are not satisfied, they will keep working on a solution...  Since their main focus is alignments, they can't afford to have a dissatisfied customer.  Thanks guys for keeping me and my customers on the 'straight and narrow'!"
"It's a shame I don't even know the name of the Dr. Who took care of us but he is a pro! I thought gingivectomy was supposed to be painful but no! He numbed 1/2 of my mouth in less than a minute. I've received local anesthesia from several dentists before, but no one was never this good. The procedure was smooth and quick. I usually fear to go back to the dentist but I can't wait for my next appointment. On the other note, they are running 1800/implant which I think is reasonable."
"Come to this store planning to burn a few hours. Their stock is quite exhaustive with the new releases, box sets, reissues, vinyl, video games, DVD's, and what seems like an endless supply of used music. Your head will spin.\nOften, there's a special on the used section (a good way of thinning the herd). You never know what you'll find in Used. I don't know if its worth it to check it out every week, but definitely every few months \n\nMy one gripe would be wanting $11.99 or more for some used CD's. That seems to be a tall request in this digital music modern world. There aren't many artists I'd pay that much for to get a new CD, much less used with a cracked cover. Gotta keep the lights on somehow, I guess."
"Let me start off by saying I'm not giving this hotel 5 stars because it's the top of the line hotel here in vegas. I'm giving it 5 stars because I walked in with very low expectations but honestly it's not that bad. It's not the best but hey for the price it's good to me. Not far from the strip at all. I booked this hotel because my sis is law recommended it. Long story short, they ended up backing out on the vegas trip so I invited my friends. The whole time I kept telling them it was very cheapy and gross hotel (because of the reviews I read) . We walked in, had trouble checking in because we booked through expedia. My name wasn't on the reservations, took about 30 mins but whatever. It wasn't hooters fault. We got to our room and it was pleasantly clean. Restroom was clean as well. Anyway, I had a nice stay. Definitely coming back to stay here if im on a budget."
"""I am local Las Vegan.  I have a pair of Silhouettes that had a broken arm.  I was having a bear of a time getting my Optician's office to repair them.  I called Frame Fixer and they said \""""Sure, come in, we have spare parts.\""""  I went down there.  The staff is friendly, the store has a lovely atmosphere and BEST of all they repaired my frame while I waited.  They have an incredible selection of eyeglass frames and options for Clip Ons for any frame.  I will most definitely return to this store."""
"This is a hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant- not much ambiance (sometimes that doesn't matter as long as the food is good). I've been going to this restaurant for a long time- this is the 3rd location since I've lived here (the first location was where the Stratosphere parking lot is, along Main Street, the second location was on Las Vegas Blvd., near Charleston, in a Thai plaza- now closed entirely- had music and a state-of-the-art karaoke system). \n\nI would usually get the Pad Thai & Thai Beef Salad (really good here). I also tried the stuffed chicken wings and Thai style rice (also very good) a while back. I went here with my husband a few times and one of my good friends (she's been back a few times after that with her husband BTW), but haven't been back in a while. Looks like a return visit is in order, and a review update."
"I thought I was going to love this place.  I did, mostly.  I went during a very hot day in June, and the cafe felt like there was no AC whatsoever.  Kind of a let-down.  The food was good (I enjoyed a lemon bar) but quite expensive, especially if I compare the price of lemon bars in higher COL areas such as Boston.  The best part was the comfy leather chairs; if I lived in the area I'm sure I'd come back.  I'd bet it's super cozy in the winter!"
"Booked a south rim tour. Started off really slow, bus took us to the Miracle Mile and then we got put on another bus after getting a danish and coffee/water to start off with. Took a while to get things organized. \nStopped near the dam, a rest stop in Kingman, Az, then had a decent lunch in Williams, Az. The south rim is quite a drive. Once we got there, we had a couple of stops at the canyon for about an hour each, then headed back with one stop again in Kingman, Az. The south rim is a long trip, prepare accordingly. We got back around 9:30 or so. Our driver, Tommy, was excellent and informative."
"This place has Powers...and they aren't magical. They have actual Powers which is rare to see now-a-days . This is probably because Powers makes magic happen (or the precise opposite,  more likely.) More likely jail time in Louisiana but that is a special story...\n\nThey have good Guinness, good outside tables, and a magnificent whiskey selection if you have that kind of money. I am definitely a fan :)"
"Nothing worse than backed up septic tank with a house full of people on thanksgiving!  Ricky stayed late and got our system pumped and working. Great guy, great service, worth every penny.  Similar price to everyone else, but superior service"
"""I'm purely rating the sushi... but just to get it out of the way-  The Hibachi is whatever.  No, it's standard.  \""""Whatever\"""" is not such a great word for reviews, I suppose.  And \""""standard\"""" meaning, edible and makes you feel like a whale when you leave and by the time you get home, you're poke-out-belly starving.\n\nThe sushi, however, has always been on point for me and my husband.  The rolls are fantastic.  The rice has never been gummy.  The nigiri pieces are huge.  Prices are fair. And they make neat things out of oranges and fake leaves.\n\nIt's too bad, we live in the Matthews area... Sooo far - but worth the drive.  I gave it 4 stars because to be fair, I'm rating the restaurant and not just part of the restaurant's menu.  Hibachi - whatever.  Crap, no - Hibachi - standard.  Sushi - great."""
"""So I walk into Shomars and observe that there are two registers with two opposite personalities. In one register, jolly man. Behind the other register, grumpy man. As fate would have it, my order was taken by grumpy man. \n\nHe was in a hurry, barking inquiries. It's fascinating because I think he might be one of the owners. \""""No Hummus!\"""" he barked at my question. Got it! Moving right along. The no hummus retort made me think the gyros might be boring, so I went with the All-American Pita Burger. \n\nThe Pita Burger was a delightful choice, served in pita bread with three thin patties, yellow-American cheese, lettuce and tomato. It hit the spot and is pretty unique to me. First All-American Pita Burger I've had at least. I'm craving one just writing about it!\n\nAnyway--check Mr. Grumpy's out!"""
"""I was recently in a vehicular accident where I was rear ended. I came here to be examined by the physician. The wait, is probably like most offices, exceptionally long.\nOnce the wait was over, I had to do a pee test, the M.A., Tamicka, was very sweet, kind, funny and saucy. She made what would have been a boring visit to the office a little more enjoyable. \nI asked her how long it would take for the Dr to see me, and she asked, \""""Why? Got somewhere to be???\"""" in a joking manner. I told her that I was hungry and had not eaten all day long. She was kind enough to supply me with water and cheese crackers. Very sweet woman.\nThe Dr was quick, to the point, and friendly.\nI have to do Therapy this Monday. I was already frustrated that I was there for two hours, but the physical therapist, Brad, was quick and brief and considerate about my need to want to leave. I honestly hate Drs officers and PT, but everyone here was warm and welcoming."""
"They finally corrected this Sam's Club with a much-needed remodeling.  Now it is just like all the other Sam's Clubs with the exception of a gas station, which is a drawback.  This Club is very nicely located, but may not have a large selection of parking.  This is also the first one in Vegas, built in 1991."
"Dropping Sullivan's down to 4 stars, rather than 5, because one of (if not their best) attribute was their wide selection of drink specials on Thursday and Sunday.  They increased the price of the specials and reduced it to only 1 drink.\n\nStill a good restaurant, but the value is no longer as high."
The only downside about this place is that the servers are slow. Tonight we just picked our own table & it took them 15 minutes to get to us just to say hi.... Other than that the place is great! Love that they close late!
"I'm a professional photographer and I've had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Nikon Professional Service too often and was searching for someone who could do repairs to Nikon cameras and lenses. BDC not only fixed the zoom and autofocus mechanisms of my Nikon 24-70mm 2.8, they did so quickly and at a fraction of the price that NPS was going to charge (like $200 less.) Best of all the lens works great, and the people I dealt with were very professional. My lens was shipped back to me surprisingly fast. This is the only time that I've used their service, but will not hesitate to do it again in the future. Goodbye NPS!!!"
"Have you had the venison?  If not, prepare to see God."
Moved from Phoenix ten years ago but still crave a cheese pizza and buffalo wings from this place.
"If you are driving by, you wouldn't notice this place. The building is old and really looks more like a dump.\n\nFirst impressions can be very misleading though! \n\nWe went there after receiving a recommendation from a coworker.  With reservations, we were immediately seated. Low lighting, soft music playing. Romantic/upscale, yet rustic feel.\n\nYou make your own salad at your table. Came with lettuce and toppings to share. I enjoyed that. Our steaks were to die for!\n\nWait staff were very pleasant. Before tip, I think our bill was $120, so not a place we would go to eat everyday. More of a celebratory-dinner location.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the evening together there."
"I have to admit.. they are the best boba place in Vegas. However, they probably have the worst customer service - but then again, what else can you expect from a restaurant in Chinatown.\n\nlove their milk green tea & mixed fruit tea and pork stew rice for dine in :)"
They most definitely have a wide variety of things. I have been several times and noticed a lot of the same things that sit for quite awhile. Not bad things just feel they are over priced. Can get crazy busy on the weekends so if you can go during the week.
Great noodle soup. \nDont really have a lot of selections to choose from but great for lunch. Don't really like the fact that they chopped meatballs in to pieces. A lot of side vedge and massive amount of noodles. Mid size is $8 large is $9.50 I never finish the large side.
"I personally am not a big fan of chain restaurants.. Mostly because of the cookie cutter decor, mediocre service, typical short of nothing special menu and general ambiance. Yes, IMO Sammy's has some of that, but for what they lack they have a better than expected menu. They offer whole grain pasta and generally healthy options-or at least more than most. It is difficult to eat out and be limited to very few options when you're watching your diet. The food was tasty with average prices. I can't complain about much, but I won't complain at all. I'm sure I'll return in the near future."
"So last time I came here, I left without food because they had run out of gyro meat. Now I know why. I could eat a metric ton of the stuff! \n\nI had a gyro combo (there's a picture here somewhere!) to go. I'm pretty sure there were angels singing somewhere when I opened the box. There was a pile of fries, a small cup of ketchup (how thoughtful!), a big cup of tzatziki sauce (literally, about a cup of sauce) and the foil wrapped gyro. The gyro itself had tomato and onion slices, a bit of parsley and a heap of meat so big it didn't quite fit in the pita. That meat...mmmm. Perfectly spiced and sliced! The whole thing was huge and I snarfed it down with gusto!\n\nPlenty of delicious food at the right price. I can't wait to go back and try some more of their menu. There are some very Mediterranean items on it, but this restaurant makes them seem completely accessible, rather than intimidating."
"The Beef & Bottle restaurant is a landmark in Charlotte. Unfortunately I've been once in the 20+ yrs I have lived in Charlotte. Driving by the restaurant isn't a decor you recognize, but going off of reviews from friends, coworkers, yelp, and other search engines made me realize I have missed out after all those years. The food was incredible for a fine dining restaurant with a set back in time. Black and white photos cover the walls inside the dimly lit atmosphere. The music was a turn off for me and sounded more like a soda shop than a an elegant experience. Service was fantastic. Most importantly is the food. My boyfriend and I ordered the prime rib, mash potatoes, and a salad. Cooked to perfection and leftovers are always a pleasure. I definitely will be back and will pass on the recommendations to friends and family just like reviews were given to me."
"This place is probably one of the more authentic tasting Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Don't order your typical american-chinese dishes like General Tso or that sweet and sour bs. That is not real chinese food. Get the salted-squid, and stir-fried chinese brocilli, the razor clams, the seafood soup, etc. I basically ask for whatever popular dishes the chinese customers eat. Closest thing to china-town food in Pittsburgh.  The places isn't the nicest place though. But then again, most places that are fancy, do not have authentic chinese food. lol"
"Woah.\n\nI mean...\n\nWoah. \n\nSo much stuff, I didn't know where to look. Much of it is newer and some of it's new. Def the place to put together an insane Halloween costume, but not the place to hit up after students arrive. I hear it's college central for like two weeks, the co-eds clear out the aisles (mostly of furniture/decor) then the place gets stocked to the ceiling again once dorms get decked with neon signage and electronic dart boards. I went with my friend Gwen who had a blast in the Packers section. They must have been having a blowout because she made out with the equivalent of a mini Packers souvenir shop of stuff for all around $100."
"Anyone who has ever been to Redbeard's knows that it will never be a five star gourmet eatery. \n\nNor does it pretend to be. \n\nInstead, Redbeard's seems to bridge a weird divide of modern style and the unrepentant proletariat with something bordering on the urbane. It's barely perceptible, but it's there.\n\nAnd it seems to work.\n\nThe menu here seems to be a compendium of all the items from every other bar you've ever entered, all congealed into one convenient list of options. Standard bar fare, true, but there's such a variety available it seems to somehow enhance the perception of its quality. And for a busy place, the service is commendable.\n\nSo, come here for a late night jaunt, a kickass burger or maybe just because your cardiologist hasn't seen you in awhile. \n\nBut whatever you do, give this place a go."
"This is a very small, older, local casino with a burger joint, bar and small sports book.  There are no gaming tables and the machines are rather evenly split between poker and slots.  If you are looking for $.50/$1/$5 machines, this is not the place for you.  This mostly a penny/nickel/dime and quarter kinda place.\n\nThe cocktail servers are very nice and provide good service.  \n\nThe burger...  I have to admit that it was one of the best I have had in Vegas.  I will definitely come back for the burger.  It was about $9 and it was plenty of food...  If you are into a no thrills, small kinda place, this is for you..."
"Too bad when I was just in Pittsburgh in May and July, I missed going to Gullifty's.  I do like the place, but since I live in FL, I can't  give you folks any current update.  Suffice it to say, it's still standing on Murray Avenue; I walked past it just a few weeks ago, but alas (though do not pity me!), I'd already eaten a wonderful lunch at the Shadyside Pamela's.  \n  Anyway, Gullifty's has provided tasty food for me and whoever my dining companions have been over the years: my cousin, my good friend, my husband and daughters.  I don't recall anyone of them remarking their food was bad.  \n   I just need to move back to Pittsburgh for about a month or two at least, then make sure I visit this place again.  \n    So, sorry for this vague and mediocre review. But I felt I should chime in with my comments since there are several negative reviews here!"
i recently posted a negative comment about Sticklers...i was WRONG! I had the wrong restaurant. I apologize profusely.\nI have eaten here and I love their food and service. I highly recommend it.
"Initially I was reluctant to come back to Lulu's based on my previous experience. But I came back and was in for a surprise.\n\nThe lady who I previously had a situation with, spoke to me. I could usually tell if someone was apologizing to me just to get it over with, or if they were sincerely apologizing. I honestly didn't expect an apology, but this was greatly appreciated.\n\nOn top of an apology, I was given a treat as well! So I appreciate knowing that a business doesn't care only about the greens, but also about customer satisfaction.\n\nHappy to say that I'll be returning for more bubble tea in the future! :)"
"Here is the deal with Falbo's\n\nDon''t expect any, and I mean any, customer service. Expect to call and have the person on the other end of the phone be rude and inattentive. Also, always have exact change if you get it delivered, Falbo's drivers are known to not carry change. \n\nThat being said, their pizza and salads are boss. This is a working mans pizza (food not price) and damn it is good. The salads are also amazing and generously portioned. \n\nIf you can put up with the attitude, falbo's is worth every penny."
"This literally is a hole in the wall. Sometimes restaurants want to be a hole in the wall,  this is a basic sandwich shop without trying. Boar's Head meats, perfect amount sandwiches, meat, cheese and bread ratio, so if you like those mile high sandwiches that you aren't able to bite, this is not that place. \n\nI ordered a Shamrock, a variation of the Ruben. Layered corned beef, swiss, Russian dressing on marbled rye bread. I added cole slaw. It was prepared with love. My sandwich came with a tiny Dixie cup of potato salad, sweet tea, all for $10.   \n\nHarrigan's easily could get overlooked, located in a shopping center off of South Blvd. Well worth a visit."
"Wow finally some basic Italian food in Madison that isn't flavorless and bland !  One of my few regrets in moving to this area is that much of the local flair is bland.  I was sad that Olive Garden was my favorite moderate priced Italian restaurant.  That is until I tried Rosati's.  I am not looking for authentic, I don't know if this real Chicago fare but I do like how it tastes.  I am pleased with the service and love the fact that you get a bowl of salty popcorn when your seated.  I hope more franchises open in the area."
"""Dr. Robertson listens to \""""mother's instinct\"""" and he works with me  to ensure great health for my 2 year old and 8 year old. I switched my pediatrician of 6 years to go to him and I am so mad at myself for not doing it 6 years earlier!!"""
"Typical scenario. I live in California, own a home in Vegas, tenant calls when it's 112 degrees and her A/C is out. I called Deke's which I found on Yelp.com on a friday, (because of the 5 stars and the westside location), they were on the job SATURDAY for no extra charge. Called me with a fair assessment, fixed the problem and billed me for the work (they don't take credit cards). They didn't bother my tenant for payment or demand cash upon completion. Made it so easy for us out of state homeowners. You deserve the 5 stars."
"Love! Love! Love this place!\nBut what's with all the tattoos and facial piercings on the people behind the cash registers? It appears as a requirement, if you want to work there. Not very professional."
"Hey tourists!  This is NOT A FIVE STAR RESTAURANT!!  (But if I were a local, I would eat here a lot.)\n\nWe ordered (1) the combo and (2) the hot pot bibimbop.  I strongly recommend both.  I really enjoyed the meat jun (part of the combo).  Everyone in the restaurant was ordering a dish that came in the hot pot, though.\n\nThis is a great place to go if you want to get away from the pricey restaurants located on the strip.  Island Style is a hole-in-the wall.  The service is fantastic...the owner is extremely nice...and it is a great value.  Not expensive and you get a nice portion.  \n\nThe owners love the customers and don't hesitate to go the extra mile.  And if you mention yelp....they love it!\n\nValue + Quality + Friendliness = Great choice for a low key dinner.  But don't expect to be amazed like many of the people on yelp apparently are.  To say this is the best restaurant in Vegas is entirely absurd."
"""Dude. Duuuuude. This place is absolutely IN. SANE.\n\nI just... I can't get over it. Jerry's was the first record store I visited in Pittsburgh and I seriously thought, \""""This is it.

It's hardly EVEN a record store, much less a gigantic warehouse stuffed to the brim with all things vinyl related.\n\nThings I love about Jerry's:\n\nGreat for everything before 2000\nAmazing prices\nThe sheer quantity\nWide variety\n\nThings I don't really love about Jerry's:\n\nTHE AMOUNT OF RECORDS HERE IS JUST SO OVERWHELMING OMG\nNo new releases\nThe environment/atmosphere - super musty\n\nThat being said, if you go to Jerry's, either plan your trip to be at LEAST an hour long or know exactly what you're looking for prior to visiting. I've only gone here a few times and every time, I spend the first half hour staring dumbfounded and confused. Really, just go to the back and look at their aisles and aisles of 45's. Absolutely absurd.\n\nAddendum: Make sure to test things out on the turntable they have there! I've picked up some records that have been quite scratched (still playing it and loving it). Also, they are CASH ONLY, so make sure to prepare accordingly!"""
"While working on the job, one can get hungry. Man hungry and the thing about man hungry is this...greek yogurts and hot pockets can't light that flame if you get me. You'll need something more heavy duty, something that gets in deep, really gets the engines revving. For that you will need Salonika. Oh what's that you say? You are working all day on making sure some steel pipeline is put into the ground, well then friend...I have the place for you. We are talking, 12 cylinders of man meat sledgehammered into what they call a gyro. Spices so sensational, you will have Bob Vila jealous at your home taste bud improvements. The best part about this man meal is that it's man cheap. This will allow you to spend your real money on lifting your truck, roofing your house or just plain old football, man style. \n\nI give this place a manly 4 out of 5.  Don't forget to bring this man meal home or eat in your car because this place doesn't have seating but that's okay...because real men don't sit...they stand tall."
"I ordered a Dirty Chai here and my life has never been the same since. When I sip on my daily, straight forward and unimaginative iced coffee, distant memories of espresso, chai, almond milk and crushed ice still dance in my mind. \n\nThe truth is, I came here for the name. And because it was literally across the street from Yelp's Summertime Soiree at the Neighborhood Theatre across the street.\n\nBut boy am I glad they came up with a quirky name to hook and line me in there to experience that Dirty and take in the sights and scents of roasting coffee."
"""Packing up and moving your life across the country can be pretty hectic. This task lands on the bottom tiers of \""""things I enjoy.\"""" However, when it came time to select a moving company to transport the family goods from Charlotte to Chicago, Easy Movers was a fine choice overall.\n\nSince hubs did the front end work of setting up and negotiating with the administrative folks, the only piece I can really comment on is that they stay true to their word. Promises were kept and our household items arrived in Chicago on time and in great shape. The actual guys who moved our boxes and furniture were polite, funny and efficient. The items from our two bedroom townhome were unloaded into our new home in a half day's time. \n\nIf you're moving in or out of the Charlotte area, Easy Movers is a solid choice!"""
"Why did I go so many years without visiting this place?  We went in once years ago and they were out of almost everything and we left empty handed.   After that I wrote them off and never visited again.  That is until I had a craving for marzipan-y baked goods!  Their almond horns are TO DIE FOR!  Their princess cake is too tasty!  Their cookies and pastries are just amazing.  They are definitely my go-to for fine sweets now!  That being said, we went at midday today and there was only ONE person working and she was busy making a HUGE order of coffee drinks that took FOREVER and the line kept building up and building up.  Some people left, but I had driven all the way over from Champaign to pick up a sweet so I stuck it out.  The server was friendly, but didn't apologize for the slow service so I imagine it's common enough that she didn't think it was an issue."
"I will concede that chains = evil, but I ask for a reprieve: it's walking distance from my home and I'd have to play Frogger on Hwy 51 to get to Dilworth Coffee. For my personal safety (and some tasty drinks) this Caribou is my place of choice.\n\nI am an aspiring coffee drinker, and while I'm not an aficionado yet, I can tell when a place uses good quality coffee beans, and on the whole Caribou uses some pretty good beans. They don't over roast their beans and the staff here (in addition to being super friendly) don't over brew the coffee. They also offer plenty of non-coffee drinks that are equally great, too, as well as a small assortment of baked goodies.  As others have said, this particular Caribou is pretty small and can feel crowded fast, but on days with decent weather I have no problem sitting outside. \n\nAnother plus: it isn't as easily overtaken by obnoxious high school kids like the Starbucks down the street."
"Growing up in the NYC area, your cut is a vital part of your image. You could be decked out in a fresh tee or Polo. Some True's and a pair of J's, but if your cut was wack, you better have a fitted to cover it up.\n\nAfter gettin' a cut here I can leave my hats at home. Well, depending on who I let chop me up. I usually get tapered by Jose Luis. He blends well and takes his time trimming with the shears. It's pretty convenient too. I call like for my appointments like 2 hrs ahead. Only negatives are.. He pushes my hairline and line up a little TOO high for my liking. I like it clean but closer to the natural hairline. Other than that, not all the barbers cut on the same level. So just pay attention!"
"I received a coupon in the mail and hired Mr. Rooter to install a new toilet in our home. I mentioned to the sales clerk on the phone that I read the reviews on yelp about their business and they are not very good. I was blunt in telling her I was not going to pay for a diaginosis fee, I simply want to replace a toilet and expect you to honor your coupon for the price you advertized. My husband said that the plumber was a very nice young man who did as great job, no hassels, no sales tactics. We are very pleased and recommend this business for hire. Thank you for your great customer service."
"Let's get this out of the way....\n\nI am one of those pedantic vegans who like to question people inside out how vegan food really is.  Ronald's know what time it is.\n\nThey keep all of their vegan donuts on the top shelves to stop non-vegan donut crumbs from falling onto them.  When I asked what products were vegan, they didn't bat an eyelid as they pointed out more vegan donuts than I'd seen in my life.\n\nThe shop itself is too cute.  Located in a strip mall a short drive out of the main gambling area, it is usually full of locals ordering take out coffee.  \n\nThis place opens super early, allowing greedy vegan chubbies like me to get 'em while they're hot!"
"I don't like shopping at Walgreens due to the pharmacy issues. However, occasionally I stop at this one because it is by my office. There is a young female cashier that is always sooooo nice.   Next time I'll get her name so I can send her praises. She is the reason this walgreens gets five stars."
"I am not a fan of Herbst locations, except their car washes. For a $6 exterior wash, this location does a good job and the service is usually friendly and on point. This wash is a machine with a person in the beginning to do an initial scrub. The plus is the no-cost vacuums..."
"After consulting with many attorneys, I was referred to Mr. Berman.  Each of the other attorneys gave me a different resolution to my problem.  Mr. Berman spent a fair amount of time with me to discuss my situation.  He was upset that a few of the other attorneys were trying to take advantage of me as their next paycheck without resolving my issue.  \nHe is trustworthy, honest and professional.  Other attorneys should follow his example \nThank you very much Mr, Berman."
"Suns out, guns out. Or in this case... suns out, all the dirty cars out.\n\nThis location is bumping at most times. It's an Autobell, so there are real no surprises here.\n\nI took Lance here a couple weeks ago to save him from the pollen. He was a hot mess inside and out. As always, they did a great job. All the workers are super nice, too. Almost like brainwashed too nice, but I like it.\n\nTrying to take a left out of here when you leave? Good luck. I recommend hanging a right and going up to the light to turn around. South Blvd can be impossible sometimes."
"One day for some reason I was craving a hot dog with sauerkraut, like the ones at the Brighton Hot Dog Shoppes in Beaver County. Where on earth could I find such a thing on the south side? Only at the Pickle Barrel. \n\nThey have all sorts of toppings for their burgers and footlong hot dogs, and they also make a big deal about their fries, which can be loaded with chili, bacon, cheese, or onions. It's standard greasy spoon kinda stuff, but pretty cheap and in a friendly (though not air conditioned) environment.\n\nI see a lot of the south side old timers here for breakfast too."
"This place is located inside of the Belk store, on the 4th floor in the area labeled customer service. In desperate need of repair, I took in my fav brown boots, which needed a new heel and to be resoled. I was hesitant, but I turned over my boots figuring they couldn't come back any worse than the condition then what they already were. I took my ticket and counted the days until I could return to pick them up. \n\nBoy o boy was I ecstatic when she opened the bag and I saw my boots, looking brand new but still worn in in all the right places! Maybe I just got lucky but they did seem to polish up the leather so I was really happy about that! \n\nI have such a hard time finding shoes that fit right so I have a serious love for the ones that make it into my closet and get worn to the point they need repair so I'm so happy to have a place to take them so I don't have to start the battle of finding a new pair again."
"Conditional Recommendation \n\nAmerispec employs a wide variety of different inspectors. I've heard both good and bad things about different inspectors and I would recommend against just using them and getting a random inspector. \n\nThat being said, Mike Hoeser is a fantastic home inspector. I've had him perform two home inspections and he was thorough and professional. He was honest and answered numerous questions. \n\nWe ended up not buying the first house he inspected based on his home inspection. He didn't recommend for or against buying the house, simply presented the report.  \n\nNot buying that house is one of the best financial decisions I have ever made and with a lesser home inspector, I might not have made it. He also caught some things that I felt the seller of the first house was being less than honest about."
"I've been looking for a very specific model road bike for a while, did my research and found the only way to get it in Vegas was to special order it and I couldn't do that on my own, I had to go through a dealer. \n\nI went in, I met with salesperson Mike, he wasn't aware of the bike I was speaking of, he grabbed his catalog found it, called the supplier and had a price for me in minutes. All he needed was a 100 dollar deposit to pull the trigger on ordering the bike, done. \n\nA week later the bike was sitting there professionally built, went to pay the bulk of the bike to find he got a discount for me, which basically covered the tax on the bike, got a lifetime warranty and 2 months of free tune up, which I will be using towards the end of that 2nd month. \n\nAlso, the bike was built beautifully and I couldnt be happier. \n\nOne cool thing, I had 90 days to pay for the bike with no interest, I just choose to pay it all right away so I could just have it."
"ok 5 stars because I dont give bad ratings, but few things can be improved like shower need to step up from 80 dark era lol and I do still smell cigarets smell in a lobby. \nLocation is absolutely amazing and for it price it is a 5 stars place. Clean and friendly."
"When I think of Woodlands, two thoughts come to mind.  The first: what the heck is a meatosaurus like me doing eating at a vegetarian restaurant?!?  Yeah, it's that good!  And the second: why didn't I know it was so close to where I lived?  That's a dangerous thing for my pocketbook.\n\nMy go-to dishes here are the Paneer Makhani and the Vegetable Makhani.  The spices are so well balanced that you completely forget there's not an ounce of meat in the place.  And the dosas...  absolutely delicious!\n\nMy wife has recently gotten into Indian food, so I have a feeling that Woodlands will be a frequented spot for quite a while.  The interior decor is a little dated, and some may look at the location as not the best in the world.  If you're wary about that, they do offer take out."
"When we walked in the place, only three other tables were occupied and they soon left, leaving us the only diners in the place.  It was a Monday evening, after all.  My sinking feeling got worse when I saw therre was a fairly small (for a Chinese place) selection of poultry dishes.  I opted for sauteed shrimp and onions in a spicy garlic sauce and my wife ordered the sesame chicken.  Both were very good.  Mine was VERY good.  And being the only diners in teh joint, attentive service was a given.  This irestaurant is VERY seafood-oriented.  Recommended."
Didn't go into the bar area so this review is only for the dining room.\n\nPretty small dining room area but they packed in as many chairs/tables as possible. You order and pick up at the same counter so customer service is really negligible. It seems like a larger scale chipotle.\nSince you aren't reserving tables you can fit in a larger group (as long as you grab the seats as they become available). You can also stay as long as you want since you don't have to worry about a waiter rushing you to leave. Also each person can walk up to the counter and order their food so there is no mess with splitting the bill. \n\nTheir turkey burger with the cilantro mess on top was awesome. BF had the steak sandwich and he loved it. Everyone else in the party seemed to be happy with their food as well. \n\n\nDownside--wait was FOREVER!! And the chairs were just plain wood. Ouch. \n\nAlthough we had a pleasant experience...I'm not dying to go back again.
"I had some bad experiences the day with DAVIDS BRIDAL,  my niece told me to go to the store she bought her prom dress at. She said they have nice choices and good service.  I had bad service all day had yelled and cried already and the bridzilla theory was becoming all too true.  Until I stepped into Celebrations I was treated like royalty. I tried on 4 dresses and the 4th one was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen and I purchased it and my search was over. Trisha was an absolute doll ! I got my vale, shoes, necklace and tierra there too!  I hope everyone goes to this store.  I am on a mission to let everyone know what a great place to go to buy a dress that will be in your memories, closet and pictures forever."
"""Since EVERYONE knows there's no culture in Arizona, my husband and I decided to waste an afternoon at the Phoenix Art Museum.  And it's really too bad their collections of American, Asian, Contemporary, and European art are non-existent, for example.\n\nAll sarcasm aside, not an easy feat for me, I really enjoy this museum.  Not having visited since the Yelp pARTy, I was anxious to come back.  Granted, I did miss the free food and drink, but it was still a great way to spend an afternoon.  I love the newly designed interior and I hope Kusama's \""""fireflies\"""" exhibit stays forever.  I seriously wish I could camp out here.  I also really enjoyed Klett & Wolfe's \""""Charting the Canyon,\"""" exhibition.  If you are a fan of the Grand Canyon, this is a must see.  The two have layered their images with 19th century drawings and mid-century photos of the same locales.  Crazy inspirational, thought-provoking, creativity here.\n\nWith the hot weather ready to pounce, the Phoenix Art Museum is a great way to spend the day.  Just don't bother to look for a fish taco on your way."""
"""Chocolate pretzel frozen custard is amazing!!! The menu is confusing as hell. Basically, there's about 5 flavors per day that you can choose from for the frozen custard. All the other flavors that are listed on the menu are NOT served. Luckily, I went on a day where they had chocolate pretzel as an option and it was decadent. The chocolate pretzel flavor was just the perfect amount of sweet and salty. The pretzel was crunchy and balanced perfectly with the chocolate. There's no place to sit and eat the custard, so it's more of an \""""order to go\"""" type of joint. It's basically a shack in a parking lot. I was confused because I was hoping that there would be an original custard flavor, but there isn't!! The closest thing is the \""""Vanilla\"""" but it just tastes like vanilla ice cream."""

"This is an addendum to a previous review (which was filtered for no reason). But, let me tell you, Thrifty's is starting to learn (not completely) the trick. Instead of using pins to secure their tags, this last group of shirts I just dropped off (n=20) all had the tags wrapped around the shirts tag and stapled at the ends (thus not wasting a pin and not putting a hole in the shirt! the only thing is they have yet to do this through a buttonhole which would be the next level of great). I think this is the one folks."
"This Walmart is a lot better than the one at 7200 Arroyo Crossings. Yes, some of the people that shop here are ghetto and they have more bums. But this place has a lot of more things in stock and it's more organized.  Arroyo's Walmart it's in a better, friendlier part of town but is always sold out of merchandise. So you can go to this place and deal with ghetto people and get your shopping done or try your luck at the rainbow/215 one."
"This isn't where I normally go for eye care but I was in a bind. I needed to study for my midterms but wouldn't you know it, I lose a screw in my glasses. So I quickly google map the closest eye care facility and it turned out to be this cozy looking place. The moment I walked in I was greeted with the friendliest hello. I told him that I had lost a screw from the hinge of my glasses and he took one look and said he'd take it to the back and it would be fixed it in a few minutes. Now usually when someone says that those few minutes really means much more but nope. In a manner of minutes he came back with my glasses fixed and looking nicer than ever!"
"AHHH, the red brat!"
"One of my tall black boots needed a new heel, so I brought them in on a Saturday morning.  Being the shoe repair novice, I honestly thought he just had to replace the one heel...but he had to replace both.  Obviously.  Good thing I brought the other shoe with me.\n\nHe replaced the heels, cleaned up the salt stains, and had them ready for me the following Wednesday.  Cost was $22, which was reasonable.  I appreciated the quick turnaround."
"Note: I did not get my car fixed here\n\n...but I did come for an estimate. Called and made an appointment for them to check out my car and they were ready for me when I arrived. It took about 10 min to check out the car and then another 10 min to type up the estimate. They came back with a price that was $800 lower and 2 days less labor than the other shop I went to for an estimate. While I didn't end up getting my car fixed here because of my insurance company (they are a Progressive affiliated shop), I have to commend them on giving me an honest estimate in a timely manner. Gracias, AAB&P!"
"Talk about a lifesaver. I bought my bridesmaid dress this past January for a September wedding. Unfortunately, I gained some weight. Three weeks before the wedding, the bridesmaid dress barely zipped up; it was so uncomfortable. I've never had anything altered so I had no clue if there was any hope on making the dress larger...I was scared to even ask. Tina was amazing! She put my mind at ease and I finally slept well knowing she would do an amazing job with the confidence and expertise she exhibited. She made it sound like it was going to be so simple and never questioned her own judgement. I picked up the dress today with the wedding happening in 4 days and I can't be happier. It's so comfortable and flows beautifully."
"This location is always quick and friendly...  I used to come a lot more often, but I've slowed down considerably...  \n\nI'm just going to go ahead and say it:  The grilled nuggets are not even worth the calories you save...  If you want to be healthy, just get a salad or eat somewhere else... I was completely underwhelmed... \n\nI love the lemonade here, much like all the rest of them... And of course, the fries are awesome..."
"Driving through Concord NC, thought I would grab some lunch. \n\nThis is one of the newer interior Hooters with the new logo. \n\nNo milk available here. Settled for Mt Dew. (General manager did offer to go and get some milk if I really wanted it).\n\nDecided on a Club Sandwich with a side of baked beans......     whooooa hold on sailor!  No beans at this Hooters. Discontinued 2 years ago.    What?\n\nI though she was kidding!  Brittany T was the nicest Hooters Girl I encountered in a long time. Actually had a great conversation with her and the general manager. \n\nThe club sandwich was great!  I didn't order any other side because I was set on beans for some reason.  \n\nThis is an above average Hooters in all respects!  Good food and great people and service.   (Only thing that I wish they still had was the sports section of the paper hanging in the bathroom. \n\nKeep it up!  Will stop by again on all trips through Concord."
"I took a wrong turn in Charlotte yesterday. Who hasn't? I ended up by Lupie's. I knew it existed but didn't take the time to stop in. The exterior can deceitful, especially if your used to the ubiquitous patina of most Charlotte restaurants. The food: amazing. Ask for the specials. There's always some seasonal goodness of the day. The beef in the chili is flavorful, and no fatty grit. I also spotted a member of Charlotte city council dining there, so you know it's a good spot."
"""Well this was not what I expected. In the hallway and stairs, you are thinking OMG I am not eating here... Even in the actual restaurant, I had some doubts, but the food was amazing!!! Blueberry pancakes were great and the coffee wasn't half bad. The wait staff seem a little put off by the fact that you are there, but \""""effe em\"""" I liked the food anyways."""
"Ragstock. Ragstock. Ragstock.\n\nSuper trendy new clothes=not into it.\n\nSuper awesome used, vintage clothes=ultra awesome.\n\n$20 vintage leather boots. Sold. \n\nYou have to check in your bag at the front, which isn't a big deal. All the good stuff is to your left and up the little stairs. And sometimes downstairs. \n\nThey have douchey sunglasses if that's your thing too. \n\nIt's something for everyone!"
"Good food, good location.  For the people that are complaining about the free chips being stale, its kinda hard to find a place where the free chips aren't stale.  Service has something to be desired."
"This place gets my four stars mainly for being the one of the only places to catch limited release movies.  The smaller theaters can't or won't take a risk showing movies that mainstream audiences don't know about.\n\n I totally found out about this quirk by accident when my friends and I happened upon a poster for a movie we, like most people, hadn't heard about.  We found out that it was a two day limited release and would only be playing at the Concord Mills theater.  Long story short, I found my new favorite actor and book series (it was Death Note, for those who wanted to know).  \n\nYou really have to look for these releases though, because they have a nasty habit of not advertising them.  Apparently movie execs don't put a lot of faith in foreign movies, even though most of them have a huge cult following before they even come over.  So keep your eyes peeled and your mind open, plus it is a very nice theater."
"""I was a \""""tough case\"""" due to my sight, so said my Optometrist before referring me for corrective surgery.  I was in my mid 40's and it was 2004.  I still have 20/20 vision but now have presbyopia, or old people's eyes.  I must endorse Christenbury for professionalism, truth in discussing the realities for my outcome, and for the care I received.  I did have to go back to be adjusted after the original surgery but rather that than living with an over correction that could not be fixed.  His office really shines for his staff.  I moved to California and now face cataract surgery where exact records are needed from my previous surgery by Christenbury.  Here it is 9 years later and my records are immediately available to my eye doctor. Thanks Melissa for your help!"""
"Every time I've gone to the Canopy Club to see some raucous rock show, I've always wondered if folks at Timpone's were being disturbed by wailing guitars and so forth.\n\nStill no answer on this but I have found that it's somewhere I'll want to be coming back to. \n\nWell, I ordered the papardelle with the bolognese. Being a bolognese snob (and believing very sincerely that the best bolognese I've had was made by yours truly), I have to say it was certainly up to my standards. In addition, I had a slice of my neighbor's margherita pizza which was also tasty. I've not been to any other Italian restaurants in town, but this is Chicago-quality stuff right here. \n\nWhile it's a little on the expensive side, it is finer dining. It's not somewhere I'd expect to go every day for lunch but it would be nice for special occasions, dates, etc."
"Until I moved to Las Vegas I had seen the same dentist my entire life, so I was nervous after a bad experience at another practice. I had nothing to worry about here though, Dr. McCaffrey is excellent; he is very patient in making sure I was comfortable and didn't feel a thing. He has replaced a couple of fillings for me and did a crown, I was very satisfied with everything. The dental hygienist is extremely sweet and does an awesome job. The staff here has always been super friendly and very efficient, I would suggest this practice to anyone!! Excellent!!"
"We used this company twice on our recent trip to Las Vegas to get married.  Our flight was delayed by the driver kept close attention to the flight status and was exactly where he was reported to be in our reservation.  On our way to the marriage bureau we asked for a Post Office in order to drop off our Elopement announcements - he knew exactly where to stop at one on the way to our final destination.\n\nOn our wedding day we reserved an Escalade from our hotel, to the chapel and then a tour of Hoover Dam.  The driver was very helpful and friendly.\n\nUsing this company made our weekend a success and we recommend them to anyone heading to Vegas.  The have a large fleet of various cars, limos and SUVs and the price is on target for the service."
"Anyone with a history of heart related issues should NOT dine here!\n\nI've been to a number of chicken/waffle houses, and Lolo's can hang with the best of them.  The fried chicken has a good balance between greasy and juicy, with seasoning that isn't overpowering.  The waffles were fairly standard, but it's hard to really jazz up a waffle.  Add an ice cream scoop's worth of butter and syrup and you are good to go.\nThe mac and cheese was good, but not spectacular.\n\nThis spot is a little hard to find as it is on a very unassuming side street, so keep your eyes peeled."
So i enjoy the food and drinks here but when seated and trying to eat the service is a bit slow. The time of day i was there was not busy at all but the employees seems pre occupied with each other. Its quicker to walk to the counter and order what you want then it is to sit and wait for them to take your order it seems. Other than that the food and drinks are awesome. I tried the yogurt green tea with boba and it was interesting and good! Not something ive ever found back home in hawaii. I think this place would do well in hawaii. The tea chicken katsu was another interesting thing but def good and somethingi havnt heard of. Def a spot ill keep coming to but most likely not to sit and eat just because the attempts ive had at seating and eating there.
"I was actually seriously terrified to go on the incline, but as we walked up to get inside, there was a huge spider, and my fear of spiders overruled my fear of heights. \n\nThe cable car was super old school. Exact change only. But the ride was smooth and beautiful.\n\nThe view of the city at night, at the top of the incline, was amazing. Overlooking the river, and all the lights, it was amazing. \n\nI'm glad the experience is over, because now I don't have to go ever again, but it was beautiful none the less."
"I am not a review writer. But I think that when you find a good health care practitioner in this city you should share it. I had my last (4th) wisdom tooth removed this morning. Getting the first 3 removed was the most horrible experience of my life. But Dr. Letelier and his staff put me completely at ease, answered all of my questions and never made me feel like I was being overly anxious, which I was. He did an excellent job. My own dentist wouldn't even touch my tooth because of it's proximity to the nerve, but Dr. Letelier is a master. The tooth is removed, I have no nerve damage and am well enough this evening to resume my regular activities. Thank you so much Dr. Letelier!!!"
"Whoa, how have I not reviewed CFT yet?\n\nOkay first, the wait: To address all these reviews that talk about waiting to be seated - yes, you usually have to wait for a table. Yes, there isn't really a good area to sit and wait. But yes, it is worth it. When you're coming to a restaurant this delicious, you'll probably have to wait.\n\nThe food: I'm not a huge fan of the chips and salsa, but most people I go with love them. I've had the BBQ Mahi Tacos (about 6 times). They are amazing. The tortillas are fried and the slaw is incredible. I usually get full after the first one, which says a lot because I can usually house my meals, but always make room for the second taco. The sides? Nothing great. Some of my friends love the jalapeno-cheddar mashers. I usually pay the up-charge to get a side salad, which is delicious, but the tacos are good enough that the lack of yummy sides doesn't really matter. The Guacamole Salmon Salad is also incredible.\n\nGreat beer selection. Decent margaritas. The prices can't be beaten. I love NoDa and I love Cabo Fish Taco."
"Just a forewarning the lines at the Cabo can be a bit long Friday and Saturday night. That being said its worth the wait and the buzzer they give you reaches across the street to the shops if your looking to blow some time. \nOnce your seated the chips and dip are amazing and the service is great. I will however warn you that you may have to seek professional help after taking that first bite. If your anything like me you may become a Fishoholic. Night flashes, shakes, panic attacks. I guess it all depends on how well you can handle a taste of heaven on earth."
"""Taipei, Taiwan, is my hometown, so it's a shame that I drove past Taipei Express several times and never dropped in until now.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao chicken, and I must say to my surprise, it tasted amazing, if not better than P.F. Chang's! Definitely not your typical \""""carryout Chinese food\"""". The size of the portions are very generous, and I could only eat half of the plate, which meant great leftovers.\n\nThe staff was really nice, and I noticed that the dining space was very well maintained. The restaurant was very clean with comfortable seating areas unlike other Chinese restaurants. \n\nIt's definitely worth ones time to stop by."""
"""A boutique for sluts. Just kidding. Sluts can't afford to shop here. This is the penultimate store for handmade leather and silk corsets. If you want a well-constructed corset that will literally last forever (unless you unlace it - don't be a retard and unlace it thinking you can re-lace it, it's not gonna happen) and you don't mind spending $300 for it, then this is the place to go. However, whether you are a \""""dancer\"""" or not, you will be treated like one.

This is the first of two kmart's I went to today in search of the new superman movie masters toy.  It never seems like many people are in this location.

"Prince William will likely end up getting married in a massive European cathedral with vaulted ceilings.  Can you imagine anything more dull and less original?\n\nAnd that's one of the reasons that people come to Vegas: to knock the stuffiness out of a solemn ceremony.  You won't find a better place than A Little White Wedding Chapel to have your Vegas-style ceremony.  The staff is fun and genuinely seem to enjoy presiding over nuptials.  \n\nI've been there twice -- once to get married to a human in a drive through ceremony under a painted starry sky and once to get married to a turkey sandwich.  See what I mean about sense of humor?  One day, the chapel staff worked with Cappriotti's on a promotion where people could come to the chapel and pledge their love to the Bobbie.  Ohh, how I love that sandwich.  \n\nAnd that's what I'm saying: if you want to be married by someone who caters to the ceremony you want, who genuinely wants to be there and who wishes your union all the best, A Little White Wedding Chapel is the place."
"What can I say? They just don't build hotels like this anymore! Yeah, my room was kind of small, but oh-so-comfortable! If you want a big room that's devoid of personality, check in somewhere else!

"I definitely wasn't expecting to eat such great authentic Thai food in Vegas since everytime I come here, I eat at the strip and asian food there is very americanized and overpriced.\n\nKomol restaurant is off the strip but not too far from the strip.  If you are willing to venture out or craving good thai food, definitely try out Komol.\n\nMy favorite there was the Tom Ka soup along with the Tofu curry and the papaya salad.  I am usually not a huge fan of Pad Thai since many places make it a little too sweet, but the Pad Thai here was very peanutty and not too sweet!  Probably the best Pad Thai I ever had for my taste :D\n\nThe Tom Ka soup and the Tofu curry is pretty spicy but very ver delicious and they go very well with rice.  Papaya salad is perfect for cooling down your palette since the food here can get pretty spicy.\n\nService wasn't the best, but wasn't too bad as well.  Prices are very reasonable :)  I will definitely come back here again!"

Pretty cheap, like $9 for a combo.  Decent food.  Not too hot or spicy.  Service was passable though if you're in a hurry I wouldn't eat outside for lunch (since they have to come up from the basement).  Wasn't as spicy or as flavorful as I had hoped, but it was a solid lunch, and I'll be back.  \n\nThe bread isn't as bad as I had read here on yelp.  A little tangy.  Fluffy.

Solid 3.5 !  I am a New Yorker so yes I am tough on pizza. Papa Johns and Dominoes just doesn't do it for me well really ever but especially not when I need my go-to rough night fixer. \n\nI can call in my order and about forty minutes later they come to my door (which is nice since I live in a complex) and deliver the pizza. Its usually hot and delicious but thickness and crispiness varies : (  . I like thin NY style pizza so this can sometimes be a let down. I wish I knew what to expect each time. The overall taste is the same and the sauce is great.\n\nA bit pricey with delivery but worth it !
"Fun atmosphere, mediocre service, good (not great) food.  Be sure to work out the check situation *before* you order.  Sometimes they get finicky and dividing things up."
"I know it isn't the greatest pizza in the world, but it isn't really about being pizza. This is more like a streamlined delivery device for everything from steak to mexican to classic comfort foods.  Ian's is quintessential part of being a UW student, especially with the demise of so many other of the campus area's late night pizza joints.\nCraziest slice I ever had there was a one-off they had created at lunch. It was poached pear with walnuts, brie, and microgreens. I think. That's close at least."
"""There's no friggin way this place can be rated 4 stars. Whoever hasn't rated this 5 stars is really stupid and shouldn't be on Yelp if all they're going to do is play around and be stupid.

"""After three days or so of being bedridden sick, and unable to eat solid food, Mineo's was my first solid food meal.  Wise? Not really, no.  Probably should have had toast or jello or something.

Yep!\n\nThe cheese was laid on a bit thick for my tastes, but other than that it was pretty delicious.  I really didn't see what was terribly remarkable about it, though.  To me, it was a decent pizza, but not a reason to celebrate.  \n\nSo that's my take on this Squirrel Hill staple.  'Tain't bad, but 'tain't life-changing, either."""
When I lived in Vegas I was right behind the place. I was coming home from a mid week bender in the strip. Didn't feel like going home and I was all jacked up on vodka/red bull and hungry. I stopped in here cuz I hadn't checked it out. \nMet someone right away from the Chicago burbs. Bartender was a cool guy. \nHad a pizza and I'm from Chicago so I'm a pizza snob. I was kinda drunk but that fawker tasted great. Had a beer or two then stumbled home and passed out.
"Super friendly staff here.  But no drive through.  They sell the hot sandwiches, which I always appreciate.  They also have a customer of the month... which is a little embarrassing.  This month it's a dog.  I'm sure the dog is cool with being customer of the month.  But personally, if my name popped up on that sign, I'd be mortified.  Don't tell the world about my sugar/caffeine addiction!\n\nSummerlin folk seem to like to hang out here with their kids, so be prepared for that.  Also, it can get a little crowded - this is a popular spot, especially on the weekends."
"For me, it's always been a challenge to find a really good Chinese restaurant that isn't just a buffet or takeout.  Usually I can only find these places in bigger cities like Chicago.  A couple of years ago, I discovered Jo Jo China Bistro in the Stonecrest shopping plaza and I've been back several times since, bringing local friends and out-of-town guests. \n\nJo Jo offers an upscale, yet casual, Chinese dining experience.  Its decor is modern, its menu is extensive, and there is plenty of seating in the dining room or at the bar.  I usually start with a sweet plum wine and hot and sour soup (Jo Jo makes some of the best hot and sour soup I've ever tasted).  Follow that with one of the spicy chicken dishes (and maybe another plum wine!), and I've had a satisfying Chinese dinner.  \n\nThe service isn't always fantastic, but the ambiance and food make up for it.  Say no to Chinese takeout and say yes to Jo Jo!   It's no downtown Chicago restaurant, but it's as close as you're going to get in Charlotte!"
"All I can say is...  I love you for existing and hate you at the same time. Sigh, I miss my skinny jeans ;)"
"I wasn't surprised to read some of the bad reviews for this joint. You really gotta be in the mood to be neglected if you sit inside. Thankfully for me I know the bartender and always get prompt service. I like the dart boards and the comfy, group friendly seating in the back room. And the patio is awesome for those wonderful Carolina summer eves. I don't know if they still do it but they used to do sushi on Monday nights and everything on that menu was bad-ass! All-in-all I like the place. Good to be a regular though."
"""They've always been able to get me in, even on freakishly short notice, as when Lumpkin ate half an aloe plant and I panicked. It's not five stars because I think sometimes they recommend over-treatment, like a special diet for her \""""allergies\"""" (\""""Live with it, Catkin,\"""" I said, and she agreed), but I'd rather they over-treat than under-treat. \n\nAlso, they have an agreement with the Dane Country Humane Society, so if you adopt a kitty there you get a discount on your first visit. The cats-only atmosphere is nice, too, as I'm not sure Lumpkin's reaction to a pit bull would be pretty."""
"McDonald's always screws my stomach up, so I don't eat it anymore. Jack in the Box is nearly the same price, however after having it consistently for over a week while in Vegas and California, I didn't have any problems. As far as fast food goes, Jack in the Box is affordable, has good food, and puts McDonald's to shame."
"I live in the DC metro area, so I am not used to being around people smoking in restaurants/bars.  I hate cigarette smoke, but given the area it's not unusual I will disregard that complaint for this review.\nSweet Jeebus I love me some Nadine's.  I love the divey-ness, when you drive by it looks more like a shed than a bar or restaurant.  You can watch your food being made, and they have delish specials.\n\nI had the most amazing fried chicken club sandwich (a special) and my husband had a burger. Food was top notch and very reasonably priced. We aren't in Pittsburgh often, but when were are there, it's our first stop."
"This isn't my favorite Avis location.  The reason I like using them is that generally they're close to the airport.  No such luck here.  They are in the same terminal with most of the  other rental cars.  If you're a regular renter, you can just check the board for your name and head downstairs and pick up your car.  The map they provide is helpful, it lists most of the major hotels in Phoenix."
"This is a very kitschy place. Very 50's diner inspired and a cool looking interior. I'll be honest and say I've never tried their food. It may not ever happen because one of my favorite restaurants ever is 2 doors away. \n\nThat being said, it's a super fun bar to visit and their beer selection rocks!  They have crazy things like Rock Bottom's Uppity Jag-Off IPA from craft beer week on tap and the bartender/owner will guide you through whatever new and exciting things they've just added and offer you a sample of anything to check and see if it's something you might like. He also remembers us every time we've walked in, which gives you that happy 'Norm!' feeling. We've had some fun conversations during our visits here and I typically like their music selections, which is a nice bonus. \n\nWe will continue to stop in here for a couple of beers whenever we're in the neighborhood just because it's fun and we know we'll like what's on tap."
"Oh Plaza Midwood, you and your silly reverse parking. I don't really understand you. However, I will endure it to come visit the Diamond.\n\nYes, it's always slammed. Yes, you may have to wait for a table. Yes, it is completely worth it. (and you never have to wait all that long)\n\nMust get app: pig wings. I know, it sounds kind of weird. They are DELICIOUS. Fried pickles and gravy fries are also good. Make sure to add pimento to the fries.\n\nA little bit of everything on this menu. Think comfort food. I like the burgers, open face hot turkey sandwich and grilled pork chops. Great side item choices for veggie plates. A lot of people rave about the veggie meatloaf. I need to try this sometime to see what the fuss is all about. \n\nFull bar. Good beer selection. They had mimosas on special Sunday. My roommate and I couldn't drink ours because the champagne was flat. Not sure what was going on there. \n\nDiverse crowd. Super laid back and chill atmosphere. The patio is great for people watching in the neighborhood."
"The stated address is incorrect. Per http://www.charlottetrolley.org/ , the address is actually at 1507 Camden Rd, Charlotte, NC 28203.\n\nWe found out about this place from a AAA street map of Charlotte, and decided to stop by. Finding parking was a trifle difficult. The museum itself is rather small, contains one rebuilt car, several HO-scale dioramas, and a very helpful staff member who showed us a stack of pictures of the discovery and extraction of car 85, which had formed the central spaces for a house! (It has since been restored, and can be found somewhere on the light rail line, supposedly.)\n\nIf you like trains or trolleys, you should go. If you like Charlotte history, you should go. This was a pretty good museum for the subject."
"Oh, Hidden House.  You and I go way back.  It started when all my coworkers and I would come visit you for happy hour after working night shift, mostly because you were the only bar open at 7 am.  But then I couldn't stay away and started coming during normal bar hours (aka at night).  I developed a love-hate relationship with your bathrooms.  I caught a guy stealing all of the quarters out of the pool tables; he felt bad and returned them.  I ordered pitcher after pitcher of cheap Bud Light.  After all we've been through, you haven't changed a bit, and I don't want you to."
"If you seek to fill out your barbecue scorecard, Bill Spoon's is definitely a stop you need to make.  Many of those newfangled places will tell you that you need pulled pork (generally longer strands of meat, often piled high on the plate).  Not here.  You get chopped pork instead - minced into tiny pieces so that it is almost unrecognizable.\n\nYou definitely know that it is meat, and the taste is unmatched.  As has been mentioned, you can get something similar at Bubba's if you are up that way.  If I recall, Bubba was a cook for Spoon's way back when, which explains the similarity in cooking styles.\n\nThe slaw is different than many, but I actually enjoy it - one of the few places I will eat slaw.  And though they did not accept anything but cash until recently, they now take cards and are even open for dinner a few nights a week.  Awesome."
"Finally I found REAL tacos in Vegas. I moved from San Francisco and was spoiled with having real authentic Mexican food and couldnt find anything in Vegas but Robertos...\nBut not anymore! I always get three carne asada tacos, a pineapple drink and a scoop of their carrots and onions on the side to nibble on."
"There is nothing fancy about southwest, but there's not much wrong with it either.  On my last flight my only complaint is that the air was not turned on in the plane while we were sitting there waiting for it to take off.  You are able to check two bags and take a carry on.  You get a drink and a snack on your trip although you get the snack before the drink for some reason.  The price is always right."
"I had a charging system issue on my Lexus so I looked online for a good lexus independent shop, after calling and speaking with Jeff about my issue he told me to bring my car down and he would do everything he could to get it fixed the same day. They got my vehicle fixed that day for me so I wasn't stuck without a car for the weekend. Great service and very friendly staff. They go above and beyond for the customers.. Thanks guys\n\nCraig"
"This shop took responsibility for what their counterpart on Cave Creek and Bell Rd could not accomplish. My car was towed to the shop with the fuel pump out. The first shop had no Master Tech in until Thursday so Devon at this shop said tow it to me, I will get it fixed. They ordered the part, had it over nighted from Jersey and fixed ASAP. The Master Tech was called in, and came in, on his day off to fix my car. I have never received such outstanding customer service from an auto shop! Devon, you did a great job, and I will be bringing my business to you from now on! This shop is the bomb and I would not trust anyone else with my Eclipse!"
"I love shopping for makeup and hair care products here. I downgraded it by one star for two reasons: 1) sometimes the high-end cosmetics does not look well-maintained and even gets a bit dirty; 2) the salon manager got really snotty with me a few weeks ago.\n\nMost of the stylists here are top notch. But I recently had a bad cut from someone who has done a terrific job on my hair in the past. When I called on Tuesday (my cut was on Friday) to say that I thought something was wrong with my cut, the manager gave me such a hard time that I considered never coming back. Everything worked out though. After Mr Ugly Manager finally saw some reason and set me up for a re-cut, I saw the same woman and she did a bang-up job the second time around.\n\nI never saw J-Byrd but someone else did my brows here about a year ago and she did a terrible job so I haven't tried the brows again. There's an Asian salon in the same strip mall as Trader Joe's over on Decatur that does great eyebrows for something like $7."
"My son turned 21 and wanted pizza. Are you serious?!. We are not in Chicago buddy!\n\nWe sat in the driveway with all five kids for about 25 minutes while I searched on Yelp! for a decent pizza place. Criteria being good, not too fancy, or expensive.\nWe narrowed it down to this place and finally headed out with hungry monsters in tow.\n\nWhat is up with restaurants in mall strips? It really give us pause as to whether to enter or not. Sorry. I'm not from around here so I'm still adjusting.\n\nWell, we ventured with our ravenous pack and was seated immediately. Ordered our drinks and appetizers. Then two pan pizzas. I appreciated the quick and attentive service.\n\nLoved the mozerally sticks. Bruschetta was missing something but decent.\n\nAs for the pan pizzas- delicious! Cheese tasted fresh. Sauce was flavorful and not overbearing. Crust was buttery and thick. Little monsters transformed into happy satisfied saints. We left full and happy.\n\nBirthday dinner for my now adult child was a success.\n\nGuess where we are ordering our pizzas when the Chicago Bears are playing?"
"Classic divebar, with plenty of local color. Last time I was there, there was an altercation between two streetwalkers who were playing the slots, and a homeless black dude. Since the machines still pay out in quarters, he grabbed the bucket of change and absconded with it, creating quite a ruckus as he spilled it during his escape. The big-tittied bartender called the cops on him and he bolted, while the ladies picked up the change off the floor. One dollar pints of Budweiser rounded out the experience, especially since they were just a tad flat. Go in through the pharmacy for that added effect...  Check out their sister bar the Decatur Liquors.."
"I have nothing bad to say about Wolbert Auto Body! As someone who knows nothing about cars or car repairs, I must admit that a visit to an auto body shop is full of comments making me feel like I'm a total idiot. \n\nThey were very nice, did not make me feel like I had no idea what was going on, and were incredibly easy to work with. They also had a great relationship with Enterprise and made the process of renting a car simple and stress free.\n\nMy insurance covered most repairs, but from what I could see, everything was pretty fairly priced. I highly recommend them for any car needs ... I will definitely be using them in the future!"
"I came here during one afternoon for a specific problem. My father's fish was dying in his pond!! So, we stopped by here because we needed a solution fast.\n\nComing in here, it was huge. All your fish needs can be taken care of here. I feel like fish can get a little pricey, but I think it's one of those animals that are a lot cheaper than other ones. \n\nService was awesome. A rep came and asked us what we needed and explained everything we needed to know. I tried to explain the symptoms and what needed to get done and he pointed us in the right direction of what needed to be put in and whatnot.\n\nOverall, we got our supplies and treatment and got out. Nice and easy."
"The service isn't as bad as most people seem to think. No, it isn't the overly nice service you get so many places these days, and the staff isn't going to hold your hand. But there's a big difference between the service at Vientiane, and if you have a bad/mean/angry/whatever waitress at Denny's. Vientiane is business-like, but they've always been nice to me. Maybe if you don't go in there and get huffy about the service, they're nicer?\n\nEither way, Vientiane is one of my favorite restaurants. It's so delicious, and I always have food for another meal leftover, and there are so many choices, even for a vegetarian. The Pad Lao is my favorite, I could get it every day."
"This is it, the last weekend ever to get some Mary Coyl's home made ice cream."
"Great doc, I wasn't thrilled to be there and he could tell, I felt cared for and left there thinking I wouldn't mind going back (if I had to)."
"""The lady who took our order was nice and accommodating.  She greeted us kindly and pulled tables together to accommodate our party.  \n\nWe ordered pho, but I believe they call it rice stick soup,  it tasted good but not great enough to warrant another return visit.  The portion was small and not adequate.  We also ordered pad Lao and it was a unique taste but probably not cooked long enough as the noodles were still hard.  The other noodle dish seems to just taste like plain noodles and pepper.\n\nIf you like your food with a little kick, be sure to order it on a \""""medium\"""" level.  WARNING: if you're used to eating food extra extra spicy, then order it on a \""""hot\"""" level.  I'm afraid to find out what their \""""extra hot\"""" level is.\n\nOverall, I give the food and service a 4 out of 5 star.  If you're an avid fan of Asian cuisine I would say this us a safe bet to eat.  If you're looking for a restaurant that has a signature dish, I don't think this is the place to find one."""
"Gisteravond na de overweldigende reviews op Yelp hier gegeten. Goed, maar geen 5*.\n\nLief wilde per se een Pekingeend en ik wilde absoluut niet nogmaals bij Pearl eten. Eerder een zeer teleurstellende ervaring gehad. Maar dat is voor een andere review.\n\nLief had zogezegd de Pekingeend, ik de beef with asperagus and black pepper. Vooraf - weer ingestonken - pot stickers en fried shrimp. Zeg maar iets met ogen en maag. Way to much. Dat moeten we echt niet meer doen.\n\nWaarom geen 5 sterren? Eten was goed, uitstekend zelf, maar de service miste een beetje. Het was een drukke doordeweekse avond en mijn lief had eigenlijk de hele eend op tafel verwacht. Maar in plaats daarvan kwam er zonder overleg eerst de buns met het vel en pas na 10 minuten de rest van de eend. Minpuntje. We zijn weliswaar toeristen, maar willen liever niet ook zo behandeld worden.\n\nVerder uitstekend, en zeer betaalbaar. Was aangenaam verrast. Heb voor het eerst een doggy bag gevraagd. Zojuist de potstickers opgewarmd en ook dan nog steeds heerlijk.....Als je in Vegas bent: doen. KJ's Kitchen wordt zeker toegevoegd aan onze standaard to-do-list. Naast The Omelet House (Charleston), The Naked Fish, Craftsteak en Il Fornaio."
"I would have given them 5 stars if they had the ox tail or the catfish.... But for summer season it is not apart of their menu. \n\nBut if your in the mood for meat so tender it falls off the bone this is the place for you! \n\nI had the goat curry.... Amazing towards the end of my meal I noticed I started eating slower b/c I knew soon it would be all gone.  I will be sure to come back!! \n\nI will give it the nom, nom, nom rating of deliciousness."
Everyone who works here is extremely friendly and helpful. For some unknown reason I have panic attacks every time I visit the dentist so I never went as often as I should have until coming here. They do a great job working things out with my insurance so my out of pocket expense is as low as it can be. I was referred here by a friend and I would also recommend this place to anyone.
"I had a coupon for a buy one get one free entree where your free entree had to be under $10. I thought that would be pretty limiting but it turns out there are a few entrees under $10 (sandwiches, burgers, small steaks)   \n\nWe started with the chicken quesadilla appetizer minus mushrooms (gross). It was a good amount of food but nothing spectacular and that may have been because the mushrooms are the spectacular part of the dish. Oh well. \n\nI got a wood grilled small steak with fries and a salad while my boyfriend got the Steak Diablo.  My steak was good, his came with a spicy sauce that he could take or leave. I don't foresee that being ordered for a second time. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and our food came out very timely.  We didn't have to open the door on the way in or on the way out, I'm a fan of that."
"I bought a bridesmaid's dress at David's Bridal for around $200.  David's wanted $60 for just a hem and I believe another $25 because it would be a two week turn around.  Of course I said no way and went to another tailor in town I was familiar with.  He wanted $100.  \n\nApparently this double, triple skirt design makes for expensive alterations.  So at this point I'm about to wear some stripper heels for height or get creative with double-sided tape.  But a coworker told me about this place and she highly recommended them.    I went on a Saturday and she looked at the dress and quoted $25 with a three day turn around.  I was leaving Friday morning.  On Thursday night before she closed she called to make sure I was coming because she knew I needed it Saturday.   I wound up picking it up Friday morning and it turned out perfect.\n\nI can't recommend this place enough for reasonable prices and great customer service."
"Portions are ridiculous, almost too big. All the food was great though."
"""I can only give this restaurant 4 stars, but it's not because of the food. I waited too long to place my order and get my check. It was busy, but you don't get  5 stars unless everything is perfect. I had the \""""Ravioli Quattro Formaggi\"""". 4 different cheeses in homemade ravioli with just enough tomato sauce. Really enjoyed it! I'll be back here each time I'm in town."""
"I don't typically do much of the shopping in our household, but I have to say that Kohl's isn't a bad choice. The staff there is friendly, and the selection isn't horrible. they also offer some pretty solid coupons just about year-round, so keep your eyes out for them.\n\nThe bad part is that it can be difficult to find items, especially if you're looking over their sale/clearance racks because there is no order to begin with, and when others start looking through them, it just gets worse - items are moved around, and new clothes get mixed in with the sale items pretty regularly.\n\nIf you persevere, however, they are definitely worthwhile. It can just take you a bit to get there."
"I feel like I should be young enough to wear these things until I think about where I would wear them.  Hmmmmm......  Yup.  I'm old. \n\nAnd yet I like this store so much that I look all the time in hopes that one day there will be something that I'll actually be able to wear.  I've found shoes - but they didn't have any in my size.  I just wish I was about 10 years younger and then I could rock it all.  I could even get away with wearing some of it to work.  Now days that just wouldn't go over so well.  \n\nPlus sized shopping for the rock&roll/punk/alt set - or just for younger folks who can pull it off.  Last time I was here I was in khaki's, penny loafers and a polo.  I think one of the girls though I was somebody's mom.  Sigh....  \n\nFor anyone, say, under 30, that is a size 12 or up, I totally suggest you shop here.  Size 12-14 is a size 0 in this store.  Not a bad little confidence booster."
Ask Charlie for a hug... and don't drink the pickle juice
"After calling 8 medical supply companies nobody had a fucking tube. We drove by Landis and thought what's the worst that could happen? The guy working came out and said he could take care of it for me, he filled my tire with goo and fit the new tube abd aired it up for me. Thanks for the help and how quickly we were in and out. I'll definitely head here for any bike or tire needs."
This round table is always amazing 5 stars for the food and the employees. The only problem they don't serve beer!!!!!! They have the tap system visible from a different owner. How do you not have beer at a pizza place? \n\nI will change my review to a full 5 star when I can sit down and have a couple beers with my pizza.
"If you know me, you know I hate basements. (Long story). \nSo if you're going to lure me below ground level, there better be amazingness below. \nAnd there is. \nDownstairs of Tornado Steakhouse in the Corral Room. \nSleek and sexy white leather booths, ambient lighting, attention to service and some rad mixology. It was down below that I tried a Tornado steak for the first time (I usually go burger) and it was pretty bomb. I feel like 13 bucks for a sirloin nothing more is a bit much, but as I cut, forked, ate... it didn't matter. Meats great. It was prepared exactly how I wanted it/asked and it was just what I was looking for to go with some expertly mixed negronis. \nI'm torn now. Upstairs or down... what do I do next time? \nDown is open Friday and Saturday, but my goal is to get enough people buzzing about it that they need to get that going all the days, all the time."
"I am from Atlanta, so I don't know or care about the politics of the ownership of this place.  All I know is the Penguin Burger I had (pimento cheese and fried pickles) was DEE-LISH-US.  It's tough to find a good burger in Charlotte, because of the dumb medium well law, but this place is fantastic.  All the other burgers looked good too and very inexpensive.  The staff was a little flirty (just the way I like them) and they even have cheap booze."

"I could walk to the Honda dealerships by my house, heck even see the sign from my roof top. however, they have screwed up on something as a simple oil change on my 2006 CRV so many times. So, I drive about 22 miles to Wally's even for an oil change, their service and pricing is top notch! It's been 3 1/2 years since I had a full time job and Wally took the time to watch my brakes for 1 1/2 years, telling me to keep waiting until needed, yet before the rotors needed to be turned. Any other shop would have told me i needed to replace them immediately. I just took my car in for it's fall/winter service, change all fluids and filters after a hot long summer and I swear everything I drive home from Wally's my car just drived better! Sure it's a little smelly and dirty from the shop mechanics, but you are not paying for a spa service for your car...(to the person below who was upset their car was not washed)!"
"When I saw that the Hooters Casino in Vegas had an average rating of 2.5 stars, I almost had a chicken-fried heart attack. Look, if you don't love Hooters restaurants, then you probably won't like the casino either. But if you're already a Hooters regular, this place is fantastic. First, you can eat buffalo wings while your dealer shuffles. The blackjack tables are cheap. Plus you're surrounded by girls in low-cut orange running shorts. So 5-stars is a no brainer if you're a smoking, boozing, buffalo-wing eating. low-stakes gambler. I can't speak to the quality of the rooms. I've only eaten and gambled in the joint. I'm sure the rooms are nicer at the Mirage, but whatever. Bottom line: Hooters breads and fries their wings -- and each one packs about 200 calories of greasy chicken. And the girls are hot. 'Nuff said. Five stars. Easy."
"I felt like The Pretzel Shop and I were star-crossed lovers of some sort. Any time I was ever in the southside and found I was craving some salty-carb action it always seemed to be closed. I would shake my fist at the sky and wonder who wouldn't ever let me have delicious warm pretzely snacks.\n\nThen on a chilly but clear Friday I was finally able to make a lunch dash! I grabbed two of the smaller bacon parm pretzels and luckily had some cash on me, as it's a cash only place. \n\nWhile on the salty side, they were DELICIOUS. They weren't warm but it was nothing a quick trip to a warm oven or the microwave wouldn't cure.\n\nIf you're in the southside around lunch time, and you want to grab a quick snack or meal make sure to stop here."
"When this place first opened the customer service was horrendous. I stopped going there. Stayed away for years. I recently started going again as it is on my way to work. And I have to say the customer service has been outstanding my emails of complaints helped.\nThe bagels are good. The breakfast sandwiches are also pretty good. But the 4 cheese souffle, now that is the shining star.It is so flaky and soft, the flavor incredible. I think 4.00 for 1 is a bit much. But for that occasional treat well worth the price. \nBravo to the staff, always very friendly."
"I'm not going to talk about the books here. I remember the days (long ago) when I barely got a few bucks back for a $250+ textbook while I completely cashed in on others.\n\nWhat I am going to talk about the insane variety of Badger gear. And, thus, the insane amount of coin you may drop ensuring that you and every single one of your family members is outfitted in red and white. \n\nThe University Book Store is a mecca of everything Bucky. Things that you couldn't even fathom to rep UW are present here. The selection is choice, the quality is high and so are the prices. Do not be shocked to see many a $65+ hoodie. It's the norm. \n\nThe kiddo and baby section is especially impressive, so definitely stop by and give a look-see for any budding Badger. \n\n*Pro tip - Bathroom is in the basement (where all those glorious textbooks lie)."
"I dropped off two pairs of jeans and a shirt to be altered.  The jeans were too long so I wanted them hemmed.  The shirt had buttons on the cuffs that fell off.  I got them back a week later - it seems like they have a lot of people coming in everyday.\n\nThe tailoring for the jeans was very good - I don't notice the seams at all yay.  They ask you what inseam length you want it to be, and if you don't know, you can always try on your pants on-site and ask the tailor to pin it for you.  However, I think they left this weird stain on my shirt - and I don't know how it got there.  Overall, the pieces of clothing cost me $27, which seemed a little high.  (Those two factors contribute to the -1 star) But they're really close to CMU (where I go to school) so I guess I'm paying for the convenience.  Overall though, they do a good job and the staff members there are really nice :)"
"My boyfriend used to work here and feels weird about coming back. So unfortunately I don't get here as often as I like. Which is a very unfortunate thing. I love their food. It's just so amazingly good. I wish it were cheaper. I ALWAYS make sure to stop by their booth at Taste of Madison to get my chocolate chip cookie dough egg roll fix. Way back in the day my boyfriend's family got the cookbook and I got a copy of the Tomato Chicken Tarragon soup. I make it all the time. Maybe some day in the future I'll be able to convince my boyfriend to come here more often.\n\nOh, and I love all the stories I've heard about the owner. He sounds like a great guy!"
"I don't eat at Marie Callender's. I used to work at one when I was in high school and I never really was a fan of their food back then up until now. \n\nHowever, I love their pies. I appreciate how fresh and inexpensive they area, when they have specials that is. Pies always seem to be a hit when you're needing to make the masses happy because you can get an assortment of pies so that there's something for everyone. \n\nMarie Callender's pies! That's all that needs to be said"
"Go for dinner or lunch, preferably dinner, as the brunch is horrible.  They just can't make a good omelet or home fries.  That said, the dinner is excellent, I order the salmon salad almost every time (it is good with the asian dressing they give you or balsamic vinegar as well).  The free bread they give you is amazing (dinner only), it is one of the reasons I go and I often ask for a second loaf.  It is particularly nice in the summer, spring, and early fall when the weather is good and you can sit on the patio outside - great for a lazy Sunday.  Consistent and friendly waitstaff."
"The only quality Chinese food I've been able to find in Squirrell Hill - they lose a star only for not delivering (which is perhaps unfair since not a lot of places here do), but it's worth it to pick up a to-go order."
"Been coming here since I moved to Vegas and haven't had any problems. Pricing is about average for dry cleaning and the job gets done. I don't like how the parking space is yards away from the building, so its a small walk."
"""I used to love love this place. Something is feeling a little off these days. I hope it's just not me. The sushis are as good as it gets. In my last visit, I got a toro (nigiri) and was quite disappointed. It was a thin slice of not so fresh toro for the same price that I paid for a fat piece of toro at an upscale place in DC. Really Chaya? Other than that, it is good. Highly recommend staying away from the \""""fancy\"""" rolls. Devote the space in your tummy for the simpler stuff. Chaya does that really really well. My Japanese friend is a fan of Chaya. That feedback means a lot!"""
"I've done my laundry at least 2 or 3 times now at Wash Tub and have had no problems.  Plenty of machines, an attendant that will break bills, and a coin dispenser.  However, there's no wifi here which seems utterly ridiculous in this day.  And not much to do in this parking lot while you're waiting, though there IS a video poker bar or two."
"Outstanding food. If you want real Chinese food like in China, go somewhere else. This is real Americanized traditional Chinese food. Terrible service. But I keep coming back because of the food. Mmm."
"""Went this afternoon after work to watch what was supposed to be a game played mostly by Packers \""""scrubs\"""" against az cardinals.  My second time here.  To my surprise, it was not only packed but standing room only.  Ordered the mountainous roadhouse nachos, tri-colored chips, with lotsa guac, sour cream, onions, peppers, blk olives and mild at best, salsa (meat extra).  Enough to take home seconds.  For the entree, the trio of fried perch sliders were awesome!  served with real french fries and delicious root beer that tastes homemade.  Great food and a great game (it's about time) by GB winning 33-7.  The place is filled with packer memorabilia and staunch fans galore.  Would give it 5 stars except for limited seating on a very busy day and a snafu by the kitchen regarding our nachos, but that happens anywhere  Otherwise, very friendly bar and alot of fun!  They serve real wisconsin walleye after 5 for dinner with baked spud and salad. Plan to go back to try that!"""
We have been going to Dr. Park for years.  He and his staff have been great.\n\n Then out of nowhere we get a letter dated 10/13/14 stating he is closing effective 10/17/14.  We received this letter on 10/17/14.\n\nI was no too happy about the lack of notice from him.  I had call on that Monday to get a refill of medication for my cat and no one even mentioned this.  They told me it would be a couple of days before I could pick it up.  Then on that Friday I get the notice in the mail.  I ended up having to go to another vet and paying much more for the medication.  Very unprofessional way to end his business.
"""I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. \n\nPrior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.\n\nNow let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has \""""Chicken & Waffles\"""" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.\n\nCheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...\n\nI'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.\n\nDamn."""
"Been hearing about this place since I moved to Sin City, finally made the effort to go even though it's only about 2 blocks from where I live.  Shame on me.  What I've been missing!  \n\nDenser, less sweet and filled with whole goodness of what ice cream should be.  I'm making my way through the 'sundae' menu and always happily consume every ounce of this wonderful product every time I go.\n\nNow you will hear and read about the sketchy neighborhood, but we've had no problems so far and have never felt like we were in any danger of any kind.  Maybe it's my NYC roots, but a it takes more than a couple of panhandlers to scare this chick away.  Craig Ferguson had it right that this is a must when in Vegas, don't let the paranoid rantings of some Valley Girl wannabe starlet keep you away.  Parked in the lot and standing on line you will see families patiently waiting for the just reward of digging into this wonderful dessert.  But take greenbacks, cause no cards are accepted."
"I can't speak enough praises about this place. \n\nI was traveling between Chicago and Providence and found my car's steering scarily unresponsive to my input. I stayed in Pittsburgh with a friend and spooked when I took it to a place that quoted me over $2000 and a wait time of 3 days (I would have had no place to stay!).\n\nI then went to Vince for a 2nd opinion. Vince made me feel right at home and not only was able to fix my car that same day, but he billed me for another service that solved the problem and only costed $800! \n\nIf you're going somewhere else, you're missing out on supporting a local business that treats you like royalty and will be honest about your options."
"The bagels are really fresh!  I wouldn't suggest coming here with a dog and expecting to have a table outside available. People who eat at this location are very snotty and could care less about you needing to eat outside with your dog.  There have been times we sat in our car with the dog to eat. The service is good but strange how you order at one station and pay at another.  That seems to be a waste of time and resources.  The building was an old gas station so there are random parking spots at the front door under the shelter. Seating inside is extremely limited so be prepared!  Do everyone a favor, and leave your kids at home!  Too small of a space for them to be running around and screaming."
"From what I hear, this is the oldest continually operating restaurant in Phoenix, and is also the last remnant of Chinatown.  The place is old and run down, parking is a pain, and it's tough to get to sometimes because of what seems like never-ending construction and road work.\n\nBut...the food is outstanding!  I am eating my way through the menu, and everything I have tried is fantastic and hot and fresh.  It's Cantonese, so a bit different than some folks may be used to unless they came here from a city with a big Chinese population.  The service is great too!"
"I absolutely love grocery shopping and I am overall a fan of Copps. The staff is sub-par....the check out people are a motly assortment of high school rejects and those who never made it to college. It doesn't really bother me though, I know what I am looking for as I do most of my grocery shopping here. Great selection of frozen dinners and the liquor is cheaper than most of the downtown liquor stores, what more could a college student ask for?"
"I ate the WHOLE calzone and didn't even get a t-shirt?!?  Really?  Not even a discount?!?\n\nSeriously, my stomach hurts so bad right now, but I conquered the beast. The whole, delicious beast in all of its entirety. \n\nThis place is not a diner, not a drive-in...definitely a dive, but, man is it good!  Came with a business party of about twelve and the place accommodated us just fine and without hesitation. \n\nEveryone loved their food, so I'll definitely be back...though next time for a MUCH smaller portion...or at least when I have portion-control. \n\nSuper delicious and a super dive!  Gotta' love places like this!\n\nCheers!"
I have been bringing my dogs to Dr. Brinkmann since my dog was blinded by another ophthalmologist here in town. Dr. B was able to save her eye from being removed  however her sight could not be restored because the damage caused by the first doctor(?) was too great. I take my dogs every 6 months to see him and his wonderful staff. Dr. B is the most experienced eye doctor for animals in Las Vegas and I recommend him highly.
"After a so-so birthing experience in Columbus, OH. and a horrible one in Weirton, WV., my wife was desperate to have the birthing experience that she wanted. In this case, that would mean a VBAC without pain medication. We searched reviews and statistical websites for weeks to find a hospital that was open to VBAC's, had a high success rate, and worked with The Midwife Center.  Mercy was the winner. \n\nThe staff was terrific and worked so well with our midwives. My wife got the birthing experience that she wanted and now she and baby are home and happy."
"Love this place. From the outside it looks closed and when you walk in it looks like they need some paint and ceiling tiles replaced. But the customer service is great! As soon as I walked in I was approached and was asked if I needed any assistance. The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful with parts and repairs. I was there for cam locks, keys, propane, sewer treatment, and a replacement door latch. They had some reasonable priced led light bulbs and wood burning products. They also have a great selection of items. Only downfall is there key machine isn't working and neither was the Propane station. Refill on propane is $3.50 lb. not bad. Call if you need to get keys or propane. But I will be back. :)"
"I came here having high expectations for their meat jun from what I was reading. Unfortunately, their meat jun didn't quite meet my expectations. Their meat jun is really good, but I have had better where it was nothing short of amazing."
"I ordered a plain cheese slice and a pepperoni one as well. I loved the crust and the cheese, but I was a bit disappointed by the sauce, it did not have much flavor. I wish it had been a bit more savory. Other than that, and the tiny size of the slices (I wand more!), this place is top notch! Will return!"
"Stopped by for a late lunch after catching a film during the Wisconsin Film Festival.  The film was rather dark and depressing.  The stomach was empty and growling.  My sister took me here and noted she takes everyone here.\n\nThe dal was ok, the samosa was great despite the sweet sauce it came floating on top of.  This is my opinion though. I'd rather coat my potato-y goodness in mint and cilantro.\n\nMy dosa was pretty good and the spice was just enough, not too much.  My sister's chicken korma was good.  I was digging the gigantic chunks of potato on her plate.  I stole them while she wasn't looking.\n\nI want to bathe in the coconut chutney served on the side.\n\nPictures of dishes posted for your viewing pleasure.  :)"
Sad to be leaving Charlotte...especially when I've finally found a jewel of a neighborhood coffee shop such as this in a city full of Starbucks and (less so now) Caribou.\n\nCame in and ordered the moose mocha - everything about it was great. Rich tasting coffee with great caramel flavor. Very warm and inviting interior as well. Will definitely be back.
"I took myself, my mom, and my stepdaughter to Best Nails for mani pedis last weekend. When we got there they were super busy; and since it was only about a half hour to closing, I figured we were probably going to be lucky to be taken in for manicures only. But no, the lady who greeted me said not to worry and that they'd take care of the full requested service for all three of us no problem. They then proceeded to do a nice, unrushed job on all three of us. We were all pleased with the results and will definitely be back."
"I was pretty bummed when I found out my AC was messed up again, and I hadn't renew my home warranty. So after researching Yelp, I came across all of these positive reviews on Action AC. They did not disappoint. They were flexible, friendly and the service tech, Dustin, made me feel comfortable having a stranger in my home. The $100 voucher sure was a big help too. If I ever need AC service again, this is the company I am going to call."
"I moved away from Madison about a year ago and having grown up in California never liked most of the bland food from Wisconsin... with a few exceptions.\n\nNew Orleans Take-Out is at the top of that list. The food is incredible... better than anything I had the week I spent in New Orleans; The Jambalaya, Red beans and rice, and especially the Shrimp Creole. Hell, they even have the best potato salad I've ever tasted.\n\nI spent a month playing with my Shrimp Creole recipe trying to get it to taste like Roussos'... I'm close, but not quite there.\n\nSo any time you are in Madison you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't treat yourself to some creole on the prairie."
"""Osaka is easily one of the most civilized sushi restaurants in Vegas, and it's my \""""default\"""" sushi spot.\n\nI have come to thoroughly dislike the multitude of \""""fusion\"""" sushi joints cropping up all over town. The majority of them are owned by Koreans and have little in common with traditional Japanese food.\n\nThankfully, Osaka is an oasis here in the Mojave desert. Having been around for more than 40 years, they were doing traditional sushi long before it has hip or trendy. And they've stuck with a traditional approach, relying on top-quality ingredients and skilled chefs.  The owner told me he gets his fish from the same supplier as Nobu and they often split a fish between the two restaurants. To the sushi snob, the difference is apparent. \n\nAs wonderful as the food is, the dining experience is what really sets Osaka apart. From the coziness of the sushi bar to the tranquility of the tatami rooms, Osaka offers the most civilized dining experience I've encountered so far. No blaring hip hop, no trendy decor, no pushy servers, just an hour or two of peace and tranquility to enjoy good quality food. It's like Zen meditation with raw fish. Divine."""
"""We've been regular customers of LMAH almost the entire time we've had our Catahoula Leopard dog, Chelsie. I admit, we didn't do such a great job of socializing her, so she gets over-excited and anxious at the vet's office. While I'm not saying, \""""Hey, if you have a nervous, poorly socialized dog, feel free to unleash your demon at this vet's office\"""", I am thankful that the staff is so understanding, patient, tolerant and caring of *our* personal demon.\n\nDr. Amy Munchausen (yah, that's her real name!) is a wonderfully caring vet and will definitely try to obtain the correct diagnosis for an ailment. Chelsie had a brief period where she had protein in her urine. Although we never found out exactly why Chelsie had proteuria, Dr. Munchausen didn't immediately prescribe a bunch of drugs or treat Chelsie like a medical experiment. Yes, the urinalysis every few weeks was a little pricey, but it was worth it to see the problem cleared up on its own."""
They make smoothies.  Can a smoothie ever be bad?
"So, I rarely write reviews but I need to contribute to the good things said about Dekes. I called earlier this week because my AC had stopped working and Steve was at my house the next day. He looked at my AC unit for 2 seconds and knew what my problem was. I just moved into this house and the unit had been neglected and just needed a couple water strainers cleaned. He took 5 minutes to tell me how to go about doing it myself and then he left. Didn't charge me a dime and it took me no time to clean the strainers myself and now my AC is working great again. If I have any problems in the future Dekes will be my first call."
All I can say is that it's the Disneyland of beauty supplies....Or maybe Mall of America....
"The door directly into the dining area is never open so don't break your arm trying to open it like I almost did.  But do walk in through the grocery store and make sure to greet the staff and you can take a seat in one of the red booths and they will wait on you.\n\nThe food is good quality.  The presentation is not spectacular, but there are few other places in town where you can get a $3 falafel sandwich that tastes this good.  Other items are also extremely reasonably priced.  Their sandwiches are pita wraps but satisfyingly filling.  Ideal for lunch or a quick meal to go.  Get the hummus or falafel appetizer for something extra to keep you going."
"This place has had more leadership changes in the last 4 years than UPitt football. But, doesn't seem to really affect them one way or another. This is a subway, people. You don't come here because you just LOVE their oven roasted chicken. You come here because it is on campus, reasonably priced, and very fast. To that end, they certainly deliver as much as even the best Subways can. They get my approval."
"Love the food, always have. I'm latina and I'm embarrased and very dissapointed tonight at the racist joke from the cook, against my friend, that's not right. There's no need for any disrespect, EVER! I overheard him say, to have my friend over pay because he's black? Wow!"
"NY pizza purists beware! You'll see black beans. Cheddar. Thai flavors. Jerk chicken. Things that could almost take these pizzas to snobby flatbreadland.\n\nBut the tastes are sharp, toppings fresh. Flavor combos pretty awesome. And they're sympathetic to veggie whining, so you can sub stuff in and out easily, with no extra charge.\n\nPlus they deliver. Quickly. And haven't screwed my orders up yet (knock on wood).\n\nPrices are a tad high, but like I said, quality stuffs are being used. A take on pie that's somewhat new to me, so this could be beginner's love. (If you guys really wanna slay the veg set, add tofu to the topping list!)"
"I usually go for sunday brunch, so can't speak for the dinners"
"This place is pretty darn big, as it is...yet packs even more into the space....the clown car of home decor, kitchen ware, and bath goods?\n\nHonestly, it is dangerous for the bank account....I only try to go when I have a list...and then force myself to stick to it...  There is ALWAYS something cool to buy here!  Bathroom mirrors?  Check, done that....cook ware, yep...awesome bamboo cutting boards?  Yep.\n\nMy only real complaints are, first sometimes it can be hard to find help.  Second...the aisles are pretty crowded and narrow....it's very easy to smash things with your cart.\n\nhint:  Don't bring kids here people.  No, don't get me wrong, I have kids of my own and adore children.  But here?  really?  This, along with Blain's Farm & Fleet, is the adult version of toys-r-us.  Come here to enjoy your grownup self and waste way too much time drooling over things you shouldn't buy...."
"Went back for CES, and I dont know if i over ate or there was some extra MSG, but i got an immediate stomach ache after the meal. The food tasted excellent however.. so im sticking with 4 stars and a warning to pace yourself, yelpers!"
"The staff is friendly, and not inefficient. But sandwiches tend to make me sick, compared to other Arby's restaurants."
The food was so good that I don't want to brush my teeth for a month at the off chance a fleck of meat might drop on my tongue
"This was my first root canal, and I was very apprehensive. My tooth was very sensitive and I didn't want anyone near it. Dr. Fife and his assistant were very good at listening to my concerns and making sure I was completely numb before they went into the tooth. When I did feel something, they instantly stopped and gave me more anesthetic. The whole procedure only took about 25 minutes. He called me personally later that evening to make sure I was doing OK. \n\nI was treated very well and am so glad I was referred to Dr. Fife!"
"Hope this place doesn't go up in smoke with the statewide smoking ban. Excellent selection of drinks. Selection of cigars left A LOT to be desired. I can understand the mark-ups, but let's also be a bit reasonable. The music last night when we went in around 12ish was horrible. The DJ looked like he thought he was cool. Let's just let him keep thinking that. I don't know what kind of mood he was looking to set, but it was reminiscient of the music playing in the background when I had my wisdom teeth pulled. I'll spin better tracks and do it for free if Maduro will let me!"
"""This was going to be the absolute last time we bought \""""Groupon.\"""" Had a bad experience with the last Groupon restaurant. We just decided only looser restaurants go with the Groupon thing. Changed our mind today. Some Groupons are hidden gems like this one. LOVED THE BREAD. The Calabrese was fantastic. Best Italian. Loved the Cannoli. Fresh. Super Great Quality. Clean and simple surroundings. He told us we could get our own Beer or Wine if we want. Next time I am taaking a bottle of Chianti. I am ready to go back for dinner tonight and just might. There is so much more on that menu I want to try. I want this place to be there forever, so spread the word and lets support this wonderful place...The owner was courteous, kind, prompt... and a great Host."""
Ive brought a bunch of pants and jeans I bought from Nordstrom here to be hemmed and couldn't tell that they weren't factory hems. He also patched a pair of jeans I'd worn through the seat all for a very reasonable price. I work in Oakland but even if I didn't I would still make the trip!
My front office experience with Pueblo was friendly and fast.  The xray technician was cordial and efficient.  Haven't had a billing problem.  But I do agree that the front offices of many medical establishments detracts from the medical professionalism of the enterprise.  Hope this isn't true with Pueblo in the future.
"It's standard bar fare.\n\nThere's, you know, drinks available.  \n\nSo why bother to review?\n\nWell, I give Angelic 5 stars because they picked my sorry ass up off the floor when I drank myself into oblivion while visiting some friends in the Madison area and seeing our favorite band play down the block.  They were kind enough to give me a little corner to sit in and brought me water and I believe told my friends to go easy on me...which was nice.     I never, ever in my life got that obliterated, and I was hundreds of miles from home.   Oh, Angelic.. thank you for not kicking me out.  I appreciate it."
"Meeting a friend for lunch, we had a little miscommunication. He went to the wrong one, so I got to see two CFA's for lunch in one day. Like the other, this one was very busy at lunch time. I guess people are thinking that chicken is healthier than the other options in this shopping plaza?\n\nLarge seating area, they have a couple of staff wandering around to improve things. The drink lady is a nice touch and she's super friendly. She even refilled the drink I'd brought from the other CFA, though that's probably not the usual deal.\n\nMy friend and I took up the table for a good hour and no one troubled us at all!"
I didn't get what the big deal was with this place or why my exchange student roommate would go there several times a week. It's my fifth year coming here and I get it now! I took my fob friend who did the ordering for me and I had one of the best Pittsburgh meals yet. The braised pork which is frighteningly fatty and delicious wowed me as did the special crispy pork roll thing and the chunk chicken. Their menu is overwhelming and I probably would never have tried these items if it weren't for my friend.\n\nOh my braised pork. \ntl;dr Take your super asian friend and make them order the good stuff and you shall be rewarded.
Freaking ridiculous kringle. YUM!
"""After eating at this place a few times now, I am still torn. Either the dishes were a hit or a complete miss with me. Here are some examples:\n\nAll the bubble drinks i have gotten have been great!\n\nThe Ma Pao Tofu was very \""""Americanized.\"""" I am used to it with diced pork and much spicier. The Tofu cubes were too big and had cubed carrots and peas, all which authentic Ma Po Tofu does not have.\n\nThe stinky tofu was delicious. One of the things I always crave when I go back to Taiwan. The Tofu was fried perfectly with a little squeak to it every bite i took. The sauce was sweet and spicy (not in the traditional stinky tofu, but still good). Also, the spicy fermented cabbage was a great compliment. \n\nI'll try to update more as I try more dishes! I am willing to give this place more chances as most places here don't even have remotely close to the authenticity that Rose Tea cafe has."""
"In the year of the Mad Men, Don Draper could do no better than this. I lived in Madison for years and only now do I realize the sex appeal that is the Tornado Club. \n\nLow, low lights and enveloping leather booths. Huge goblets for my crimson red wine. A hot, humid summer night. Take this review as you will, I didn't eat anything, but I drank plenty. My best friend who was with me eats burgers there late at night; she vouches for their quality. \n\n Draper could have been in the booth next to me with a dirty martini and a bloody fillet, and I wouldn't have batted an eye."
"I've been here a few times in the past and it was not the best experiences of my life. Apparently they have had some management and employee changes and the service has gotten much better. I worked with Mike (the store manager) directly and he made sure that everything was good for me. \n\nThe price was reasonable, the quoted times were accurate. Will go again."
"I am so sad that Border's is closing. :-(  This store is so much nicer than B&N.   They have always had such a great selection of books, CD's, DVDs, games, greeting cards, etc.  I liked the little cafe a lot too.  \n\nGet by there quickly if you want to pick up some deals on clearance items, I am not sure when the last day will be."
"3 Stars for the Food~\n4 Stars for the Service~~\n\nHonestly, having walked by this place for years and never giving them a try, I decided to on this trip mainly because I didn't feel like leaving the property for the night. On the one hand, I was always turned off by the North Korean style karaoke going on by the waitresses (oddly enough they never sing the good 50's songs). On the other hand I was always tempted by the plastic looking desserts at the entrance. I did not know they were real but asked about them because they are not on the menu. The ultimate grilled cheese was great,  though they should have mixed the cheeses rather than keeping them separated. Its also kinda bland, but still fantastic. The carrot cake did not taste like carrot cake, but I will give something else a try next time around for the sweet tooth.\n\nService was Outstanding! Everyone seemed genuinely nice and enjoyed their jobs, even the cooks in the back singing along."
"I haven't been to an Outback in years.  I was on a road trip with my brother and we wanted to go out for a steak dinner.  I was buying.  I checked out some other local place but everything was really pricey.  We settled on Outback because the prices seemed reasonable.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla appetizer, which was not traditional but still very good.  My bother ordered the sirloin and lobster tail ~$23.00.  The lobster tails were three half tails, and a little on the small side but perfectly cooked and very tasty.  His steak was beautiful rare to perfection.  I ordered the prime rib, a 12 oz cut for I think it was 16.00.  It was excellent, perfectly rare, perfectly tender.  I was also able to get a baked sweet potato with brown sugar and honey that was fantastic.  The service was great too.  All and all a very satisfying meal for around $55."
"I visited Cecil's West for the first time last week. I had a pair of flat riding boots that was too wide and tall at the shaft plus a purse with a loose handle. I went to Cecil's and showed him the boots. He gave me great advice about the boots, and prevented me from ruining them by moving or adjusting items on the boot that would have made them look worse. He was the voice of reason, and was not going to undertake a job that would not make me happy at the end! I really appreciated that! He did a great job on my purse. I highly recommend this for any shoe/purse repairs!"
"Got the carne asada Jr. Burrito, it was dank! Although, it does suck to pay extra for things that are supposed to be included already. But besides that, Los Tacos was a party in my mouth."
"It's McDonalds. You know what to expect and are disappointed when you don't. I as in a hurry and stopped here for breakfast one morning. It was fairly busy and I considered going in instead of the drive through because the line was so long.  I didn't and it actually moved far more quickly than I expected. I got a gravy biscuit which came out hot and fresh. I hate when you can tell its been under a heat lamp too long, this did not.  Hot fresh food. What more can you really hope for at McDonalds."
"Now, I have to preface my review with my first impression of this place.  My neighbor went there one night at the end of a long night of drinking.  He fell asleep at the bar.  \n\nWhat does that have to do with the quality of this place?  Nothing.  This is just an attempt for me to make fun of him.\n\nMy ideal bar is a place that is not loud, not full of pretentious people, full of dubstep music, or has 30,000 TVs.  Instead a place where you can relax and have a conversation with friends.  That is what Le Tigre Lounge is.  \n\nFilled with decorations of tigers, tiger stripes, and retro accents, this place is also dark enough that you could make out in the corner and nobody would probably notice.  \n\nThe drink prices were reasonable but there is not a wide variety of beers on tap.  \n\nOverall a great place to hang out with your friends, be around non-pretentious people, and have a good time."
"Since they started roasting their own coffee, I take back my so-so review from before and give Smelly Cat a no-charity rating of 4 stars."
This is one place that doesn't care... In a good way. They do what they do GREAT! This isn't chipotle so get that out of your head. Great food every time I visit. Pretty much weekly.
"a little far away from the strip but worth the drive. $20 for unlimited rides on the 3 tracks they have for one hour. not my favorite go kart track, that goes to the one in kissimee florida. the only downfall was that we got jipped out of a lap on our final track since our passed expired 2 minutes after we got on."
Charlotte institution that has gained all my business since the ugly Penguin divorce happened.
"Well that other review is a bummer, so here I am to help out.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here because he was in the mood to buy new shoes. A loyal Chuck Taylor wear-er, he was pleased to find many, many styles of Chucks. Sadly, not a lot of those cool styles had his size. \n\nThe employee was super helpful in letting him know what styles they did have in size though, which was nice. My guy wanted to try on some classic black hightops, and the guy brought them out super fast.\n\nIt was a match and we checked out. I will say he spent $52, which I thought was a lot, but I never buy new shoes, so maybe it is standard."
"I really thought they were my favorite pizza of all time. Ordering a whole pizza- it was a cheesy mess of amazing. SO GOOD.  BUT I had a big disappointing visit last time. We are too poor to afford 30 dollar pizza all the time so when we need a fix we went in for slices.  I got the pizza in the rack when you first walk in.   My crust was so hard and chewy it was obvious it was old pizza. Like bad old pizza. Like all day sitting out old pizza.  So I still like the whole pie, but mineo's can give me both good pie AND slices. I know its a pizza war out there in sq. Hill, but I think I have finally picked a side. Mineo's for me please."
"This place is decent. Love the outdoor seating.  But overpriced?  Really?  Noooo, you must have the wrong place, lots of food for cheap, appetizers good too, nothing to rave about. They give you a lot of food and it satifies your greasy food craving.  I'll be back."
"In the summer of 2012, I was admitted to St. Mary's with a severe case of Lyme Disease, that led to total heart block. The physicians knew about LD (many don't), treated this aggressively and promptly, and I was out in ten days, with no signs of LD since.\n\nThe physicians, nurses, and financial department were top-notch. They even wrote off the remainder of my bill that my insurance didn't cover, due to me taking a low salary for a non-profit organization.\n\nI can't say enough good things about St. Mary's. They turned a tough experience into a very positive couple of weeks in my life."

"We had a major issue in our house! Watter backing up everywhere and smelly too! My Dad recommended Larkin to us. \n\nWhen I called they were so friendly and helpful. My dumb self had put Draino down the pipes to fix the problem . They told me that would ruin their equipment. But they were nice enough to give me advice to help us out till the morning. \n\nOur tech arrived early (by 15 minutes). I had no idea where to drain for the house was. Rick found it. And he took care of the problem in minimal time. He was quick yet efficent. He was very friendly too. He explained everything that he was doing so there was no surprises. The pricing was fair. \n\nHe was also very understanding and kind to my devil dogs! A major plus in my book! Thanks again, Rick!"
I haven't gotten a facial in nearly 7 years but recently I've been experiencing a horrible breakout due to stress.  I was in dire need of an extraction and The Spa at Lakeside was able to fit me in for a facial the same day.\n\nMy facial was done by Rachelle and she was awesome.  I came in after work tense and stressed out but afterwards I was surprisingly really relaxed.  She worked wonders on my face and I can see a significant difference right after.  The products that were used were all natural which I love and the staff is friendly.\n\nIt was only $50 for my facial which is a very inexpensive rate for a facial considering the other places that I've called around to.  I'm definitely going to be coming back since they're having a package of a facial AND massage for only $100.  This place is definitely a spot for locals and it has an amazing view of the lake as well.  It can't get any better than this place!
"Utilitarian, with the bathrooms in the back storeroom. It's smaller than most, with limited stock. Several of the things I normally get are not offered here. \n\nStill, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and quick."
"It's a nice convenient place to grab breakfast or lunch on your way to the office. My main complaint was they require a $10 minimum purchase to use a credit card. So basically you need cash on you to go here. That was really the only thing I didn't like about the place, other than that the food was pretty decent."
"Should you go in for a quickie wedding or go for the free photo op outside? I chose the photo op but we did take a quick look around. Wedding prices start at around $80. I Saw a couple doing a drive thru wedding, saw a live wedding going on in the front yard, the bride was in a white miniskirt. Took a walk through the waiting room, it was like a dentists office with the amount of people waiting to get hitched. They even told me they will take you through the drive thru with a pink Cadillac or have Elvis marry you."
"I love dr kirsten Rojas! She's wonderful and has helped me tremendously to get me this far when other doctors couldn't. So it makes me mad when people say she runs useless tests for more money. These tests are to figure out what's going on. If she wasn't a great doctor people wouldn't keep seeing  her. However, the wait is long ( but worth it to see her if you ask me) just make sure you allow plenty of time. She runs late because she spends time with you and doesn't rush you In and out.  The staff is a mixed bunch. Girls in back are wonderful. Check in / out is sometimes a mess. Name and info has been mixed up or copay confusion. You have to stay on top of them and do your job as a patient and be informed about what's going on with you. I would recommend her any day."
"I have no idea how this place has stayed under the radar for so long, maybe that really awkward location on the Boulder Highway a little south of Charleston. The food however is some of the best in Las Vegas, much better than many of the very popular and highly overrated places that I won't mention  (everyone knows them) .\n\nCarne Asada Tampiquena, Ceviche Tostada, Mojarra mojo de ajo, Cheese enchiladas, Shrimp, and al Pastor tacos, are some of my favorites. Hell, even the Hamburguesa is good. The owner is always there and the food is fresh and cooked with care. Highly recommended. The only reason I don't go more often is that they close fairly early, about 8:00 PM.\n\nBTW, Lowes is directly across the street."
"Stepping into this place, you feel like you're in some weird NYC stereotype.  It's a small store with a counter and most of the room is taken up by a pizza oven.\n\nA personal size pizza is $4.50 and it's usually more than generous.  We've ordered small calzones, and what comes out is a 4 pound monstrosity of awesomeness.\n\nI eat here about once a week and would recommend it to anybody looking for decent cheap italian fare."
"""I always take my shoe/boot repairs to Cecil's, they're friendly and helpful, and honest, too.  They'll make suggestions about caring for items and tell you if they can't fix something.  One time I brought a boot in for a new grommet, he attached a new one in about a minute, and said it was one dollar.  I didn't have any cash on me, and he said \""""pay the next time you're in.\""""  Of course, I ran to the car and borrowed a dollar from my mom, but you don't get that kind of service any where anymore!  They'll even polish your riding boots, and they've fixed my half chaps a few times--no comment on their work, I'm just really hard on my riding gear.\n\nBe sure to say \""""hi\"""" to Felix the shop cat (and real boss of the place)."""
"BUSY ALL THE TIME!! Every time I eat at Cabo it's packed. Doesn't seem to matter if it's on a monday night or a friday night. They are always hopping. One thing's for sure, though, the food is worth the wait! I haven't had anything I didn't LOVE here! My usual are the bbq mahi tacos with a side of slaw. YUM. Just the right amount of spice for me on the tacos and the slaw is delicious. The beer selection is pretty great and they have margaritas galore. Parking can be tricky because NODA has limited spaces near the main drag. Be prepared to walk a little."
"""This is a great place to stumble into after bar time for some greasy grub. Of course, it's not the greatest Greek ethnic restaurant I've ever been to... so far, nothing compares to any restaurant in the \""""Greek Town\"""" area of Detroit.

This is a greasy spoon that caters to drunk college students... and it does that well. Very well.\n\nOrder yourself a gyro, and make sure to get an order of fries... If not for yourself, at least to share. They are amazing."""
"""Pittsburgh, PA came to my small office because of having intermittent Internet connection. It was more like 80% down and 20% working.

"Insane amounts of wigs, hair, clothing, and beauty supplies for all ethnicities. They also have a 99 cent jewelry section. But beware the jewelry off to the side, it's way overpriced. I'll definitely be back though, got several items I couldn't find anywhere else since moving to Charlotte."
"Being from California, on any day of the week you can get a mani/pedi/eyebrow wax all in one visit for less than $30 including tip.  So you can imagine my frustration, moving to Vegas and realizing that nail salons want to charge you an arm and a leg for their services.  Okay okay, I'm exaggerating!  \n\nI was thrilled when my friend introduced me to Escape salon.  They have the best collection of nail polish, including O.P.I. and Essie.  Seriously, there's every color you can imagine.  They charge $15 each for a manicure and pedicure.  I've tried out a couple of salons and this is as cheap as it gets.  Plus, they do a great job!  They're all really friendly and even offer you something to drink.  If I wasn't such a poor college student, I'd be visiting more often.  Check it out!"
"I've noticed that this place has gotten a majority of 5 stars, well that may be due to the awesome chicken with the tasty skin that you just have to devour, and the greens that had me picking up my bowl and consuming the goods like 3 year old, but can I get some room, please! \nI'm knocking elbows with everyone around me. When I want to fully enjoy my meal I want all of it to go into my mouth, not down my shirt because the person behind me had to get up and shoved my chair right to the table. No elbows on the table here; there's no room!!! \noh, and the mac n' cheez is good and all but why is it after 2 bites I taste nothing but cream of mushroom soup and not cheese.....just a thought! \nand that is why I give 4 stars and not 5......"
"With an uncle and two cousins that are doctors I am writing this from the business side. I call Dr. Butler's office and get an appointment the same day. I get seen within fifteen minutes of my appointment time. He fixes what ails me. If you need a good, professional doctor and office staff, Dr Butler fills that need. If you want hand holding you probably won't get it here. One star does not seem right."
"This Coach Store always, always, always has a ton of people in it. It does not matter what day, what time, what holiday, etc. It is always packed, no matter what. I guess the slashed prices on their purses will have that effect on people. \n\nI have been here on countless occasions. Most recently I went in search of a new handbag and succeeded in my journey. I bought one of their new bags and used the 20% coupon given to me upon entering. They ALWAYS give out the percentage coupons. I've never been in here when they haven't.\n\nIt is what it is. If you go in, make sure to expect the hustle-bustle of a bunch of people and be forewarned: there may be lines you have to wait in. If you can just take it easy and not get irritated it's a great place to get a cheap purse. After all, Coach really isn't all its cracked up to be these days with many other designer purses pulling ahead of them in the game. Still, I like them for what they are - a designer purse anyone can have."
"My battery died at the sonic across the way a few days ago,  I was pretty upset but I walked over to midas and asked them to jump me.   They were awesome,  he was so sweet and patient with me so of course I returned to purchase a new battery.   Then a couple days later my check engine light came on.  I went to auto zone (I know) where they told me it was my battery.  Wait,  what?   So I called and talked to the guy who helped me before,  Randy, and if course he was amazing.   I brought my 4 runner in the next day to find out what was really wrong.  Randy was so helpful and explained everything to me in detail.   Thank you Randy and midas for the excellent service,  I'll definitely be back!"

"Ever been driving and glanced up to see that little oil change reminder staring you down...  and you realize oh crap, I am way overdue. *Raises hand*\n\nThat was me last week. No wonder Lance was running a little rough. Off to the Precision Tune Auto Care we go. Why PTAC? Well, because it's just a few blocks from my home... and I had a coupon. Turns out I didn't even need it, though. A full service oil change is only $21.90 every day. \n\nThere were several people waiting, so I took a seat and made myself comfy for the afternoon. While I was there, I had them take care of a couple other overdue maintenance issues. \n\nThe manager is super nice. There is coffee on site (don't expect Starbucks quality... come on, you're at a mechanic shop) and there is also a phone charging station. This saved me when my phone went dead.\n\nI didn't spend an arm and a leg. My car is running a lot better now. Need a quick, cheap oil change? If you're near South Blvd, stop in here!"
"Pay no attention to the bums getting paid to buy some kids liquor at the gas station next door.  Really, they're just part of the scenery. Anyway, the bums just sit there and hang out...why not contribute help some kids out...kids who unfortunately have custody of their 5 year old sibling...\n\nNothing can distract hubby and I from the delicious custard at Luv-It.  Okay...almost nothing.  We're always grateful to be in the company of some other out-of-towners who bravely make the trek for the world's greatest frozen custard.  We stand around and compare our choices as unsavory characters occassionally stroll by.\n\nOtherwise, hubby and I grab our desserts and hop back in our car pronto, one of driving with our knees so that our custard doesn't melt before we enjoy it.  \n\nDefinitely worth the drive out to old-school not-so-safe Las Vegas but be smart about it.  Don't let yummy frozen custard get you mugged."
This is the BEST shop in town. Emily is amazing. I thought I would go to a little bit cheaper shop and ended up with a crappy tattoo. I crawled back to Emily and she very kindly promised to fix it. She fixed it so well that I ended up getting an amazing lower sleeve that looks like it was done on a TV show all off a tattoo that originally looked horrible. They are worth every penny! I will never go anywhere else.
"It is sad this small venue is gone. They had good accoustics, you could get up close & personal with the bands, & they supported the local scene."
"I just moved to Carrick from Dormont and I was looking for a GREAT place for Chinese food that delivered. I used to order Amazing Wok and was so sad to be leaving that area! I ordered Wang's on a Friday night well home alone while my husband was at work. I got a dinner (Tsos) and Rangoons for $12! Portions were big and food was EXCELLENT! They also quoted me at 40 minutes, and arrived in 25! The Rangoons were BY FAR the best I've EVER had! I think the kicker that made this place amazing for me is that I called on a Sunday night  at 9:35 and asked when they stopped delivering. They told me 10:00 but were more than happy to deliver at that time! For that, I will forever be a failthful customer! Amazing service!"
"Somewhat of a dive but perfect for late nights after hitting downtown. \n\nCareful for the death trap to and from the bathroom, those stairs have taken down many a drunk."
Mochi mandu soup for a hangover. Point blank period.
"Smothered cabbage. \n\nI almost want to end this review with those two words. Smothered freakin' cabbage. \n\nIf you haven't had the smothered cabbage, you are missing the true meaning of life. I can't even properly describe it, as the description won't do it justice. No matter how many times I wash my hands, my fingers are not clean enough to type of the holy deliciousness that is Cajun Yard Dog smothered cabbage. It's something like cheese sauce that the cabbage is in...I'm not sure what that stuff is, really, but it's GOOD.\n\nThere's all kinds of wonderful cajun specialties, and the menu also has a few Southern classics, like the pimento cheese plate. I enjoy the pickled vegetable salad as well. Their prices are reasonable, the service is good, and the decor is as charming as anywhere I've been in Charlotte."
"Environmentalist be warned; you'll hate this place on principle. They use styrofoam plates & cups & disposable cutlery. \n\nLuckily for me, I don't give a shit. The place is what to be expected when you enter, very umm homey. Its clear there are a good deal of regulars here, as the staff seem to know them quite well. \n\nWe went around lunchtime so I opted for a sandwich, instead of breakfast. I ordered the tuna melt w/ green beans (I love green beans). The green beans clearly came from a can, & were incredibly salt..which was actually fine by me, but some people may not care for that. The tuna melt itself was very flavorful. My only complaint with it would be that it could've been a bit hotter. \n\nI would really like to try their breakfast, as that seems to be what they're known for."
Had the stupid fries and they were stupid good. Lemonade was also on point.
"I love the Original sandwich here, but I wish they weren't stingy on the toppings. It seems like each time I have a sandwich there is less and less tomatoes, lettuce, black olives, and salami on it!  Today my Original's toppings didnt cover my whole sandwich, so I ate a lot of bread :( \nThe customer service here is great.  Both the girl taking my order, and the man delivering my food to my table were extremely friendly.  And a pecan chicken cranberry salad was tried...it was good!\nI wish their parking lot was larger, it is very tiny and full at lunchtime. It's very hard to get out of a parking spot!"
Called this Macy's after the bad experience at the Macy's in the Meadows Mall.  The lady on the phone was very polite and helpful and even told us the item we were looking for was going to be on sale the next day.  We had bought some of the items off a wedding registry at other stores (they were much cheaper) and she said they could take them off as long as we showed proof (to ensure the couple really did get what they wanted).  We went here and the lady we talked to on the phone was not there but she told the lady working there all about our situation and they took care of marking the items as purchased on the registry and we got the other item on sale.  We will be back here for sure - customer service is so important - I hope Macy's in Meadows Mall learns a lesson.
I come here M-Friday. Parking lot can become a nightmare and place is a little small But I come between 2:00-3:30 maybe till 4 and theres less people. I like that they have a side for only women that's a nice feature for people who are easily intimated or shy. Staff or people that come here are not snobby and bathrooms are clean. i pay 20 a month and no contract I can attend the fitness classes at that price if I wished.
"Nice place, good service. I would give it a 5 star but I got some of the order-in food and was severely disappointed. The nachos were awful, basically tasted like a plate of cheap tortilla chips with cheap shredded Sargentos microwaved for $10. The internet was free , you just need a username and password which I got from the front desk."
Food is great and the new building is quite roomy and nice (even if I miss the nostalgia of the old location). But I can't give it 5 starts because of the rule of not allowing multiple credit cards for payment. This policy - especially with large parties - was pretty inconvenient. There were people in my party who were annoyed enough not to come back. :-(
Damn what shoe restoration! Don't even think about going anywhere else in vegas to get your shoes repaired!!a+++++
Food is always good here but it's a little over priced. A standard burger with fries and a soda will be over $10 for one person not to mention the cost of adding toppings to the burger.
if you can get passed all the girls in short skirts and big boobs !!!!\nthe hamburger and buffalo chicken sandwich are good. but you can sit there all day and they won't buy you one drink. ;(
"Despite the name, it's not a gym - it's a gay club that features vocalists, drag revues, go-go boys in cages, and male strippers, all of whom fortunately work out when they're not working here. Two-for-one drinks from 6:00 to 9:00pm nightly."
"After checking in with Yelp, the Fam and I decided to visit John's.  The decor was non-existent, I guess this is how they are able to keep the prices so low.  We fed a group of three for about 25$.  In these time we sure have to watch our pennies and this is the perfect place to for it.  The table barely had enough room to accomedate all of our platters.  The waitress was awesome and kept the coffee cups full. Each customer received a personal greeting unpon entering. The food was pretty good.  Something that I have never seen on a menu before....brains(pork) with eggs, and livermush.  If you are brave enough to try it please post and let us know!"
"Have been there before. Don't quite remember the cuisine, but this place you should try, to see how it feels to eat in a church."
"While visiting my elderly parents  a heavy glass table top broke.  I called Kelly's glass. They were wonderful!  They came out and measured for the table and delivered the glass to me.  Had I been at home I would have loaded the table into the Jeep and taken it to them.  But since my parents have a small economy car I wasn't able to fit the table or the completed glass into the car.  I had called a couple other companies and they would not come out to measure a table top.  I greatly appreciated the service I received from Rick, James and installer Chris. Also the price was very reasonable.  I highly recommend Kelly Glass and Mirror."
"First of all, I think it may be new management or owners, because the dining floor was completely dead compared to before.  We came in a little later in the night, but it still used to be packed all the time.\n\nI also noticed they stopped posting up the menu and specials on the walls...\n\nAnyways, this is still very solid authentic Chinese food.  My friend that does not eat chinese food at all, asked for Orange Chicken since it wasn't on the menu lol.  The waiter replied that they could make something for her, and it came out pretty well....she was a fan.\n\nI always go with salt and pepper shrimp or crab when I am here, and it was still good.  Went with a few other dishes like a sizzling eggplant and beef, pork fried rice, eggplant, and a few others.\n\nA bonus though, we got there right at 10pm and was surprised to see a discount on the tab...20% I believe\n\nOne of the best authentic chinese places you will find IMO...give it a shot if you are nearby"
"Don't be confused by the name.  This is not a full-service bakery.  I've never seen a loaf of bread or a cake in the place.  It sells donuts, turnovers, and persians/bismarks.  (They might do cookies too.)  Apple turnovers I bought on April 6 were EXCELLENT and actually had a good amount of apples and not too much cinnamon.  Dough was crispy and airy, just what you want in a turnover.  The glazed cake donuts were excellent, even the day after I bought them and they were not greasy tasting.   I've had their chocolate-covered custard-filled bismarks and those were good too, but the apple turnovers are THE BEST."
"Phat Burrito's burritos are just that: Phat. And, depending on how you order them, they're Fat too. And really, there's no reason to order anything else. \n\nChoose from BBQ Chicken, Steak, Chicken, Fish and Grilled Veggies (the girlfriend's pick every time). Surprisingly, the fish is excellent--and at a really good value. It's like a blackened Tilapia and comes with a pineapple-y salsa. Extremely tasty. Everything else is good as well--and you can add beans (black, spicy red or refried) for no additional cost. Go with the spicy red; you won't be disappointed. The guacamole isnt anything special, but it's fresh and tasty, so throw that on your burrito as well. \n\nGrab a Modelo as your cerveza and you're all set to enjoy the funky decor of the spare inside. Outside seating is perfect for a warm evening, and there's often a mellow hipster crowd out there enjoying itself. \n\nLife is Phat."
"I have no idea how they make money.\n\nThe Badlands Saloon is somewhat of a dive, but manages to avoid being grungy. This gay bar sports pool, a jukebox, and low, low prices. Their strip mall location means easy parking.\n\nIf I recall correctly, the bartender informed us that there were no specials, but when quoting prices, our jaws dropped - and our livers quivered. Our bartender was a hoot, and somehow I ended up donning a wig while there, while tossing back vodka.\n\nIf it wasn't for Lotus of Siam (our intended target) being closed, we'd never have ended up here. Sure, the Saloon was empty - it WAS late afternoon - but my crew and I enjoyed each others's company and might've left more than a little merry. What happens in Vegas... you know."
"I think 300 East is great, but it isn't the best place to take a picky eater (especially a picky male eater) because the menu is lacking things like french fries, huge hamburgers, or chicken wings.  The food here is very fresh and original.  The lunch menu is predominately salads and sandwiches, while the dinner menu has more entrees.  While the food is great, it can get cowded for lunch or dinner, and the service is not extremely fast.  There are aften people hanging out here after work for a quick glass of wine and maybe and an appetizer.  If you have an hour or so to spend, you wont regret going here to eat.  I highly reccomend the Fall Salad with port soaked cherries, goat cheese, and pancetta dressing.\n\n***UPDATE: they changed their menu so i can't vouch for some of the new stuff.  also, after the menu change you no longer get a side item with your sandwich- i like the food but that's totally lame."
"Painful, as a Marquette grad to rate anything in Madison as positive...  But it is a pretty good sports bar in a hotel.  I've been here a couple times and always found the staff friendly and attentive (morning breakfast excluded, and why I ding a star).  \n\nBar staff was amazing, friendly, attentive.  Heck they made us chicken quesadilla appetizer that was even on the menu.\n\nMorning service (aka bar supporting hotel) not so much.  Staff in attentive and know most are on coupons, etc.  Once the buffet wasn't even open.  \n\nBut as a guy that relocated to the South...  Visiting in January...  Only option ;)"
"No nonsense barber shop.  Plenty of periodicals, and you won't spend more than 10-15 minutes in the chair.  Discounts for military as well.  Your best bet is probably just to show up, there's no reason to call ahead."
The food is great just the waiter suck no joke and I hate that they sell you every drink in other words no fountain drinks they sell you every pop but over all it's good little pricey
"""This was our third year for the annual \""""Istmas beer and cheese\"""" - I really like the festival but this year there were too many people.  I didn't get to sample much beer and I think I only sampled 2 cheese.  The lines getting in were terribly organized and the coat check was ridiculous.  They really should have that figured out by now.  The event itself is great and we will probably go again - I was just disaapointed that I didn't get around as much this year because of the crowds."""
"Every Time I eat here I get the Exact same Thing and I always think they will not have it anymore or I will not be able to remember what is is called nor how to order!  The Staff here is probably Cousin to Vavid and very helpful!\n\nPork BBQ Wrap, Minus the Rice, Minus the Cole Slaw, Minus the Cheese and Extra Sauce called well I'm not going to mis-spell that on yelp, nor say it, though it is good!\n\nCollards on the Side please!"
"We are from out of town with our dog and she contracted some fleas. We didn't think to bring any flea medicine so we called this vet and they prescribed her some meds without even an appointment and costly evaluation. I was in and out in 5 minutes. These people are awesome, very courteous, and very friendly. Minus the fact I didn't directly deal with a doctor, the staff and service was great."
"I love the Original Pancake House, but I always hated going to the SouthPark location because it's always insanely busy, usually has a long wait and the tables are incredibly close together.  This location is much more comfortable and has a little more room to sprawl.  We got there around 8:30 on a Sunday morning and left just as it was starting to get busy.  Delicious pancakes, cheery atmosphere and quick service gets my vote every time!"
"I, like most people are very leery about getting ripped off, when it comes to car repairs. I thought my brakes were in for a major repair and major $$$. I was told the rear brakes were fine and the front brakes would not be a major repair. They did a great job at a fair price and even fixed (no charge) a panel above the front wheel well that had popped out! \nHighly recommended."
"""An institution on the southside and deserving of its reputation as the grand daddy of cigar stores in Pittsburgh. Parking can be tough but hey, it's South Side. Parking is tough everywhere.

I always feel like I'm interrupting something when I walk in. But the humidor is large, the selection is very good - including their own branded cigar which is excellent - and the prices are on par with just about anywhere else.

I always get the homemade turkey sandwich with peppers.  Peppers are the business!  The peppers make your mouth burns a lil but then again I don't handle spiciness well.
"""Let me tell you something.... it is not easy to make a good French Onion Soup! It is quite easy to screw this one dish up....But Houlihan's passes the test and serves one of the best French Onion soups that I have had the pleasure of eating. In fact, I peeled off the cheese on the side of the bowl because it was that delicious! \n\nMy main course was an Atlantic Salmon with bread salad and asparagus.... I will just have to deal with the \""""smelly pee-pee\"""" that is commonly associated with asparagus! The salad consisted of arugula (or Rocket) and was served with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. \n\nThis place was packed on a Friday night, was very clean, and the service was friendly to the point that the servers were constantly apologetic for things that did not require apology. They definitely had an \""""I can do it\"""" attitude and believed in good customer service."""
"When I first moved to Squirrel Hill I went up and down Murray trying to find a place that did pizza right and I was sorely disappointed. I wasn't looked for fancy weird pizza. I was looking for the pizza I enjoy eating when it's cheese or maybe pepperoni. Then I noticed these guys just off Murray, and boy am I glad I did. Their pizza is pizza and done RIGHT! I also regularly get their Cesar salad., which I also like quite a bit."
"Dr Amy Sparks is a first-rate internist and a wonderful, compassionate person. I have great confidence in her.\n\nI think the reviewer below (in Lansdale, PA) must be writing about a different doctor, since Dr Amy Sparks is in Las Vegas, NOT in PA. Also the description of office procedures doesn't sound right.\n\nUpdate 2013: Dr Sparks is still at the same location on W. Twain Ave, but her telephone number has changed: the new number is 702-722-2200. She has left Health Care Partners and is now Sparks Family Medicine."
"Let me just get this out of the way:  I've been going to this restaurant for years and received some of the WORST service I've ever experienced.   The last time I ate at this place, everything went wrong...but I won't go into details.  It is a true testament to the food that I'll be going back, again, and again, and again.  My favorite meal is the pork bulgogi, which is amazingly tender and has just the right amount of char that carmelizes the flavorful marinade.  Be sure to ask for it with spicy sauce.  The seafood soup is also very good.  The little dishes with kimchi and sweet potato that come with your meal are a real treat."
"It's been a while since I've been to On the Border. I think it was when I was in college when I first went and it was pretty wack. It was beyond wack... I couldn't believe this place existed. I guess they did an overhaul on the menu... perhaps I have the restaurants confused... oh well... This day! Kat made the experience and food great. Sometimes when the food is okay, the staff makes the people come back. Kat hooked us up with extra and gave us tips on the food. I've been here a couple times but this time was the best. I customized my fajitas and got the pulled pork and grilled chicken. I put the saut\u00e9ed onions, peppers, guacamole, sour cream, refrained beans, queso, shredded cheese, and salsa. \n\nYea... I'm one of those people who puts a lot of sh*t in my eggs... But I like it. Chips and salsa are good. Definitely coming back to this location, especially if Kat is here."

"This is my favorite Burger King in the world because it has so much character. First off, it has one of the most old-timey BK signs I've ever seen. It looks like it's from the 1950s. \n\nThe service is comically bad. The staff here is incredibly slow. Sometimes they'll see you standing there and not help you for several minutes. I've had to wait in line more than 20 minutes when the line was long.\n\nAnd don't even think about making a special request (e.g., no mayo). You won't get it. \n\nWhen the service is this bad, it makes for an entertaining experience. Honestly. And the staff is friendly, even if they couldn't care less about their jobs."
"it was really good bowl of pho. is it me the vietnamese people don't eat meat at all? because a big bowl of pho only has 4 slices of beef and 3 beefballs. I think if any of you on Atkin diet, shouldn't come here, because they give out lots of noodle. oh the broth is really good, this good on a cold day."
"Ancora made me a coffee snob!!!\n\nI didn't know a damn thing about beans before working here in college, and really I still don't, but what I DO know is that these folks have put together a pretty kick ass Roasterie in the middle of Wisconsin and are educating folks about proper coffee.  I compare every latte I sip to that of an Ancora cup.  \n\nEven though there are the occasional retail snafus, this place is the shit!  The regulars are the shit, the coffee is the shit, the baristas are the shit.  I can't say enough about it.  Maybe 'cause they used to pay me?  Anywho... if you ever find your self roaming Monroe Street, stop in and have one for me."
"I'm on a low carb diet right now, so I had to pass on the pizza, unfortunately.  I was expecting to order a house salad with chicken.  When I told the server my diet limitations, she suggested a side of meatballs for about $4.  It was perfect.  I had the smallest bill at the table, and the meatballs were homemade and plenty tasty."
"The Bread Company is one of the best restaurants in C-U!  If you think that the reason why they are selling out of different entrees at dinner is because of poor planning, it is obvious that you have never worked in the restaurant industry.  Dishes sell out at the Bread Company because they are popular...duh!  There is no way to predict what will sell what night, and if you are upset that dishes are out of stock, you should be showing up earlier to insure that they still have their full night's supply.  As for the service being poor, it's true: the servers are mostly college kids that could give two shakes about their job, but the food is so incredible, it just doesn't matter to me.  The head chef, Daniel is honest to God a pure genius when it comes to creating new dishes and I never order off of anything but the specials menu.  Trust me when I say trust Dan with your dinner.  If he has a hand in creating it it's bound to be amazing."
"I came here to get a trim on my naturally straight, long blonde hair. I wasn't sure what to expect and am always apprehensive about trying new salons. Since my hair is so fine, I know it can be hard to cut. My stylist did a good cut, so I can't complain about that. The only thing I didn't like was that she seemed in a hurry and that she didn't do much styling after the cut. The entire wash, trim and style took about 30 minutes. She did talk to me briefly about what kind of cut I wanted, but didn't ask how I wanted it styled at the end. She did a basic blow dry which left my hair pin straight (how it usually is). When I come to a salon, I like my hair to be styled with some pizzazz and oomph to it. I want it to be styled in a way that makes me feel like a celebrity when I leave. For this reason, I give the salon 4 stars instead of 5."
"I am typically a Fili B's girl as opposed to the generic ***berto's fan, but I can compromise since Fili B's are harder to find when you aren't in the EV.  I was really really craving a big ol' steak and egg burrito, and I knew the only way to satisfy that craving would be from one of these places.  We were on our way uptown and we ALWAYS see cars in the Eriberto's drive thru on our way to work, so I figured it had to be one of the better ones.  Oh man it is!  My burrito was more like a steak with egg burrito.  It probably weighed three pounds!  It was absolutely delicious, flavorful, and surprisingly not greasy!  I devoured a whopping half of it before I tapped out and then I ate the rest for breakfast the next morning, and yeah, it actually tastes just as good.  I can't really attest to the quality of the other menu items, but if they are even half as good as my burrito was, then you're in good hands."
"""Just having moved here from Seattle, figuring out which plants will survive here has been kind of hard.

"Dont believe the hype, not one person in the bar was from the Twin Cities because I walked around and asked majority of the patrons, there were only 8 in the tavern @ the time it was 8pm Sun.nite. the bartender was very nice and outgoing also not from MN. & thats ok,  real drab boring waitress from New Jersey who assumed and kept the leftover change $5.00 from a large bill without returning my change, I would have tipped her more . I hate when waitresses pull that stunt . Only in Vegas and only someone hailing from Jersey.  Excellent cole slaw, good burgers,very stingy with the fries that you have to pay extra for, Oh you pay extra for the cole slaw also. Dark neighborhood at night."
Was not let down by the reviews and ratings! It was yummy. Although everyines fiod was great I have to agree with hubby and wasn't to impressed with the gravy. And I wanted to by one of the items they had for sale and couldn't because the person with the keys was not there. Disappointed because I really wanted to purchase the items. But I would eat there again. As a mattrr of fact I book marked it so when we cone back to Vegas we can go there again.
"Being a beer drinker, i feel bad for saying it, but for some reason, my two stops at Brawley's didn't sell me so i still go to Total Wine. This is still my go-to place for beer. Plenty to choose from. They always have a nice seasonal selection and quite a variety of domestic and import. My only complaint is they don't have a vast NC selection. i don't spend much time in the refrigerated section, so don't know what hides over there.  Another bonus, they regularly send a $1 off coupon in their email to use when you make your own 6 pack. \nAs far as wine, there's a ton of it. i don't drink much wine beyond a very rare 2 buck chuck, but they seem to have a plethora to choose from.  Based on the people i know that love Brawley's, i have a feeling i will succumb to them someday, but for now, it's still Total Wine for my beer."
"My wife and I were here today for probably the 400th time.  Come here at least twice a month without fail.  Never thought to post a Yelp for whatever reason until now.  The owner came by our table, as he usually does as he makes the rounds and checks on the patrons.  He happened to mention how there were a couple reviews that were really bad and how disappointed he was that someone would have had such a bad experience.  By the number of visits, its easy to tell we really like the place.  The staff is super friendly and the food is always good. From the pizza to the sandwiches to the soup to the fresh baked cookies, we've tried it all and it's delicious."
big selection of plastic models and airplanes not so much on RC cars. prices are very affordable and comparable to online prices.
"Better than Baskin Robins or Coldstone, not quite as awesome as H\u00e4agen-Dazs or Maggie Moo's, and is right around the corner from my new place in Pittsburgh. Danger, danger! \n\nToday I took the ice cream bull by waffle horns and instead of *talking* about how I'm going to get ice cream, actually *got* ice cream. It was a HUGE single scoop (really, it was 2.5, I saw him do it!) of turtle-flavored goodness, overflowing from the tasty waffle cone that fell right into my hands for only $3.50! \n\nBut every fairy tale comes to an end, as is this Bruster's location - they will be closing at the end of August. So you know what that means, right? Better get my share before they do!"
I stopped at this location because of a driver's side wiper blade that was not making contact in my line of sight across the windshield (had on for less than one month). Joe exceeded my expectations when he took a look at the wiper blade and tested different brands to help fix the issue. I will definitely return to this location for the friendly service and attention to customer needs.
"I came here to have my last lunch in Madison. \n\nNeedless to say, everything I had was fresh and a great combination of flavors. \n\nI'm so sad that I discovered it so late. Makes my tummy sad, but probably good for my waistline."
"""It's clear that the majority of Las Vegans have still not discovered the joy of Mexican food from Los Tacos.  If they had, if they had tasted the joy of a Los Tacos carne asada burrito, they would have chased Taco Bell and Roberto's out of town--out into the desert wastelands where people might not mind the dregs of Mexican food.\n\nLos Tacos is playing at a whole other level than Roberto's, Taco Bell and the other Mexican food chains around Vegas.  Quite simply, there isn't a better cheap burrito in town.  It's probably because Los Tacos operates under the \""""radical\"""" notion that fresh ingredients make better food.  Fresh salsa, fresh guacamole, fresh cilantro.  And the steak for the carne asada dishes?  It's tender, seasoned, wonderful.  Simple, quick and delicious."""
"Start off your trip here just like the cows did, corralled in to a long orderly line, but you will be met by some one who takes your order not the slaughter house.\n\nIf you are not a meat eater your options are limited, and on my visit they were out of veggie burgers. Luckily they have a cod sandwich (4.79). If you want a side think cut fries are a steep $1.75 for a small tray or they have other options like fried zucinni that is upwards of $3\n\nThe condiment section is great with jalape\u00f1os peppers sauces galore onions lettuce and tomato.\n\nfor a drink they have a new coke flavor wave which is always fun, and there is a bar that is connected with free popcorn which is a big plus for me. (that is why its 4 stars)\n\nMy fish sandwich it self tasted of char and the included tar tar sauce, the bun was soft and fresh. Despite saying its was some large fraction of a pound of fish it seemed a bit thin and small.\n\nOverall if you are a vegetarian, pescaterian you can make by here but it should not be your first choice."
"I go here often for lunch.  The place is kept clean and the staff is very friendly.  I can see how Nilay thought the service was lacking in smiles, but I guess everyone has their good and bad days.\n\nIt's bad when I walk in and the guys already know what I am going to order.  I try to switch it up for variety, but it's hard to break old habits.  \n\nMy only gripe about this place is the shopping center location and it is a little difficult to get out of the parking lot due to a fairly busy intersection on Prosperity Church Rd."
"It is sad to know that I live less than two hours away from Chicago, yet there are no local deep dish pizza places around.  To get my thick crust, cheese and sausage fix, I go to Uno's.  I never leave disappointed and always leave full. I like going there when my boyfriend and I can't really decide where to go for dinner because, frankly, you can ALWAYS eat pizza. :-D"
"This was my first experience with vinegar-based BBBQ (yep, the extra B is for BYOBB). I have to say that the taste is not quite something that I would crave. However, the food was still good (BBQ, cole slaw, BBQ potatoes, and hush puppies). The hush puppies here are absolutely phenomenal. If I lived around the area, I would go back just for the hush puppies!\n\nEven though the style of BBQ didn't totally fit my tastes, the hush puppies were delicious and the service is a great example of southern hospitality. The staff was so nice!\n\nRemember, cash and checks only!"
Only place we go for pizza locally
"Try the salt baked squid.  Seriously, try it.  You won't find a better place.  Even if you don't like squid, try it.  I don't like squid and this dish doesn't remind me that I am eating tentacles.  It is salty with a slight crunch.  I haven't found a place that make salt bake squid this good.  I go to this place and order this dish each and every time.  Beware though, you'll get addicted to it.\n\nI also tried their beef lo mein dishes and I like it as well.  I don't like their beef chow fun.  Lulu's is better for that. I do like their sushi as well.  I mainly get the Philadelphia rolls.  I enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, I like this place but there are some things that they can fix.  Tables are sometimes sticky.  They reuse the chopstick wrapper. But honestly, I haven't had any explosive diarrhea from this place so I'm going to keep going back."
"""\""""Is it yucky?\"""" a friend asked me of the Movies 10 in Matthews. Many discount theaters get a reputation for having sticky seats, funky smells, and screaming children, but the Matthews 10 is an exception to the $2 theater rule. I've had only good experiences there.\n\nOn Mondays, there's a bonus discount. Tickets are only $.50, which is absolutely awesome. While they've got cheap tickets, their concessions are still pretty prices, so you might want to bring along your big purse and stop at the gas station on the way there (if you know what I'm sayin'). \n\nI tend to hit this spot up about once a week, as I'm just not willing to spend what the mainstream theaters are charging for movies. If you wait a month or so after the new stuff comes out, it finds its way almost always to the Matthews 10. \n\nIt's nearby a few fun chain restaurants as well. I have made a whole date night out of Cici's pizza and a Matthews 10 movie for less than $20. It can be done!"""
"This CVS is the reason why my faith in humanity has been restored. When coming back from the doctor's office after taking in my son my normal pharmacy called me to inform me that they didn't have his antibiotic in stock and it would take 2 days to fill so I opted to go to Walgreens up the street and called them and needles to say they were horrific! They even hung up on me as I was asking questions. At the time I was new to the area and on the bus so I took a leap of faith and got off when I saw this store and went in. They were so amazing, they filled my son's prescription and even called my other pharmacy for me and got everything squared away. I now have a car and will drive the extra half mile just to go to this store."
"Starbucks coffee is utter garbage.  If you want quality coffee, I can give you five other coffee shops on State Street which serve coffee that doesn't taste like it was filtered through an old muffler.\n\nWhy four stars, then? The service. I have never ever been made to feel like I'm bothering them when I order my drink.  THAT is why I go to Starbucks versus the hipper coffee establishments down the street.  This location has the best service I've ever seen ANYWHERE.  I've never seen such friendly baristas.  Is the coffee spiked?  \n\nLook, if you work at a Starbucks near campus, you're going to deal with all sorts of characters: bratty undergrads, random homeless, impatient businessmen who have important meetings, etc, etc. I've never seen an employee lose their cool.  In fact, they look like they're having fun most of the time.\n\nCome for the awesome service, stay for the meh coffee."
"I don't get items dry cleaned very often, so when I needed to have a formal dress cleaned, I wasn't sure where to go.  Even though I had coupons in my Bucky Book for three other cleaners, I decided to use Right Touch after reading the Yelp reviews (those other cleaners scored very low, and Right Touch scored very high).  \n\nMy dress had only been worn once, and it had a large dark stain on the front.  The dress was stored in my closet with that stain for over seven years!  I was not sure it could be cleaned at all.  But Right Touch said they would do their best, and they got it completely out!  The dress looks brand new, and I am thrilled!  Plus, the price was incredibly reasonable!  I will definitely use them again for any future dry cleaning needs!!"
"I'm terrified of dentists and any dental work. When I had to get my wisdom teeth out (all four were impacted; one horizontally), I was sweating bullets.\n\nI knew I was going to go for general anesthesia--I didn't want to hear anything. I was really grateful these guys were covered by my insurance because they did the best job possible with my bad teeth.\n\nThey gave me the medication I'd need after, made sure I was well taken care of, and it was a very comfortable area with helpful staff. I'm not quite sure what one ought to be looking for in perfection when it comes to dental surgery, but compared to where I've had it before and this place? This place, a million times over.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this place if you have to get some surgery work done."
My favorite target in the area. Just gotta deal with that parking lot.  Avoid during holidays...but that's all stores.
"There is no doubt this place is beautifully breathtaking,  but the catering is little to be desired.  We attended the Military Ball last night and the venue definitely set the stage.  The venue gets 5 stars.  My only issue was the food.  It was terrible.  I felt like I was eating dog food. Beef tips on rice with bland potatoes and green beans... When you think beef tip for a fancy sit down dinner you expect more than 3 pieces of smaller then bite size beef. I definitely was not happy."
"The last remaining Farm Basket in Las Vegas. SO SAD about that. FB is a unique but very delicious fast food shop that specalizes in chicken and turkey items. Best on their menu is the Great Gobbler sandwich, a deep fried half turkey breast sandwich with Miracle Whip.There's something so great about this! Perhaps that it's cooked to order and fresh helps. It could also be their delish fries (if they are cooked in turkey fat/oil it explains ALOT of why they are so great) that are served with a Lawry's seasoning salt. Simple, but oh-so good.\n\nFor me, it's on the other side town, but when i'm in the area, I have to get some. When this one closes, it will be a very sad day for me."
"This place is a headache.  I went on a Saturday morning for brunch and there was so much noise and hustle.  Definitely did not like that aspect.\n\nThe food is good.  I ordered French toast and a scrambler to share.  The French toast came with fresh fruit and tasted super yummy.  The scrambler portion was small, but very tasty!  Perhaps the potatoes were too drenched in oil because they were orange in color.  \n\nThe service is decent.  The girls at the register are nicer.  I would like to return, but on a quieter day."
"""When we moved in to our new house, gave them a call to rekey everything. Prompt and courteous. Got the job done well. \n\nTwo things I did not like so much:\n1.

"With its Wild West decor, this strip-mall saloon easily could fool you into thinking it's a hangout for local rednecks . . . until you notice all the rainbow flags and Judy and Bette blaring from the jukebox. It may be a gay bar, but if its decorator was as well, he must have suffered from mad cow disease, given the bovine motif that runs rampant throughout. The predominantly fortysomething-plus crowd is dressed as if it left the back forty to mosey into town for bargain Buds and billiards, but for most it's cowboy drag rather than an actual lifestyle. You'll find an even mix of friendly locals cruising for new blood and tourists hoping to lasso themselves a Tex - or two - for the night."
"These guys are awesome.  I had just come out here in August and needed a smog check but there was a leak in my exhaust system, I went to Purrfect auto which wanted to charge me $700, I came away from her and the work with materials was $120.  They are honest and fast."
"I had a bad experience with Thai Basil when they first opened and have not been back since. I am really glad we gave them another chance!! We called in our order and it was ready when we arrived 15 minutes later. The place was quite busy with carryout orders, there is really no dine in space. The man tending the front counter was efficient and pleasant even with how busy they were. This was appreciated, since inefficiency was the reason for our initial bad experience. We ordered chicken pot stickers, spicy cashew nut with shrimp, and spicy fried rice with chicken, planning to share. The two entrees were really tasty, the potstickers were nothing exciting. Great heat on the food and portions were a good size.  The one disappointment was they did not include the rice that goes with the spicy cashew nut and we did not realize it until we got home. Since that was the case I gave up half my fried rice to my dining partner.  We both found ourselves wishing we had more food. Will definitely be back, but this time will check our order before leaving."
Walmart is always the best. Set up a little different then most I've been too but easy to find your way around and get lost just looking. Parking is the worst during the day heads up.
"I have been many places, had many bagels, and I am typically disappointed in the experience, so what a pleasure to visit Forever Bagel.\n\nI always want to get the toasted bagel with cream cheese and eat it as a little breakfast sandwich, but 10 times out of 10 you get an over toasted bagel, or a really tough bagel, or runny cream cheese and bam....it suck!\n\nBut now I am 2 for 2 at Forever Bagel.  Great tasting bagels that are not too tough and very flavorful.  Cream cheese that is solid and does not simply drip out.  I have had the Honey Oat and Cinnamon Maple bagels thus far and neither disappointed.  Pumpkin cream cheese (we, as a society have overdone the pumpkin thing, but I still like it!) was delicious as well.\n\nAnd the price.....I almost fell over it was so low!  Coffee is good as well.  \n\nThe location knocks it down a star....very difficult to get heading back in the correct direction after a visit, but such is life for good, inexpensive bagels!   So skip Panera and hit Forever Bagel if you have the choice!"

I even forced myself not to buy more because there was still a lot of shopping to do. \n\nAnyway, I appreciate when the associates try to keep the merchandise as organized as possible.

"This place is tiny and its a liitle bit in the cutties...this is another one of them down places. So Foofoo warning in effect. \n\nStart with koolaid but get some water to cut it. This is the sweetest koolaid ever. Its good....i think the ratio is 1 jar of Water, one pack of koolaid, one pound of sugar! Lol!\n\nThe waffle is great. The chicken.....awesome. \n\nDesert was amazing! Banana pudding was off the hook.\n\nIm mobile.so sorry i can't write too much more but this place is worth stopping at if you're ever in phoenix. Comfortable great music great food."
"Favorite Madison barber shop, have paid much more for a much worse looking haircut elsewhere. Parking on game days is a nightmare so keep that in mind. Three barbers work here, have gotten a good cut from all."
"""maybe it is because I am from Vegas but I like this gift shop! It is kinda sketchy in the parking lot I can't deny that. I personally wouldn't walk through it alone.\nThis place is broken up into several different shops. They have themes going. So they have an area that sells lingerie and an area that sells bridal shower stuff and then the gift shop that sells anything they can think of putting \""""Las Vegas\"""" on. \nThey also have a area that sells alcohol. \nDon't come here expecting glitz and glamour just come on in knowing you are in the largest gift shop in the world :)"""
"Tokyo eggroll.......I would drive across town just to get some, seriously.\n\nMy normal order is 2 orders of enrolls and wanton soup. Hubby' s is teriyaki chicken.  I  really want to try the yakisoba, but the eggrolls suck me in every time."
"Enormous, has most everything you need, but for some reason, it's always packed. If you can/want to navigate the crowds, go for it. You'll also get a clear sense of what the CLT shopper's look is like these days. Not much for people watching, despite that previous sentence."
"It's a cemetery, what can I say. You have to be that type of person that likes that sort of thing I guess, but to be honest I saw many regular folks just using it for a afternoon job. It is a very large cemetery and would take a few hours at least to really take in. I didn't get through half of it. It is a very pretty places, with lots of trees. We even saw 10-15 deer throughout. I think it would be a great place any time of day just to walk around. Quiet and peaceful...with ..oh yeah.. a lot of dead people. You really get to see the economic lines between people here to. Some of these mausoleums, tombs, stones are huge. The money that was dished out in mind blowing. I enjoyed myself, and like I said. this place takes awhile to get through, each experience would be unique. Highly recommend"
"This place use to be downtown Urbana.  I drove by one day when I came back to town, and noticed they were gone.  Damn, I thought they closed down.  Driving back, I was on University and noticed they had moved.  Yay.  I have always been a fan of the Record Swap.  Before Exile opened they were one of the last independent music stores left in the area.  The owner is a little odd and reserved, but I have always found him a likable guy when he opens up.  He knows his stuff as well.\n\nAnyway, rows of used CD's, some new but not a ton of new releases.  A bunch of vinyl.  Some box sets up front.  An awesome selection, I have even found some bootlegs here I can't get anywhere else.  Vinyl is in good shape as well.  I have always been a fan.  Even though they have moved, the store has not changed one bit."
Been a Vinnie's fan since it opened.  Went through a bit a rough time a few years back.  Seemed like a staffing issue.  Ate there yesterday.  Food was hot & good.  Didn't wait very long.  It formerly had a reputation of taking forever to eat.  Parking almost empty lately.  Try it again.
"Brought me safely from point A to point B several times. I think people forget that's what the airline is for. It's not about feeding you, stroking your ego or accommodating your afternoon nap. All airlines overbook flights. All airlines have delays. US Airways does quiet a bit to help the community like sponsoring the Phoenix Zoo, donating to St Mary's food bank, & the United Way."
"""I tried competitors and see the value in the statement, \""""You get what you pay for\"""". Yes, the prices are little more, but my clothes have always been cleaned well and they've never lost anything of mine.   Moreover, they will take responsibility if the service isn't up to snuff. For example, I took shoes in for new leather soles and heels. They told me they would be done off site . For some reason, the new heels were done in a different color from the boots. Seeing my displeasure, the lady charged me nothing for the shoe repair. That was very fair and I really couldn't blame them as the repair was outsourced. Great place."""
"""always a fan of boba.  Service is never expected to be \""""nice\"""".  You don't go and eat here for the service, that's for sure.  The drinks are another story and I ordered their noodle soup dish that had shredded pork with bok choy.  Unfortunately they don't give enough veggies or meat but plenty of noodles.  \n\nThe noise level is a bit high and they could turn down the music a bit.  You barely can hear the other person talking across the table from you.\n\nOpened late when the other restaurants in the shopping plaza right next door close at 10pm is a benefit here.  I was happy to at least get my \""""noodle on\"""" and stay warm."""
"The only bad thing about McBride Companies is that they've now ruined me for ever renting again! I was so spoiled having my first studio apartment be with McBride at 699 Station. Their properties are clean and in beautiful condition. They answered maintenance requests rapidly and actually fixed what was wrong the first time. They are nice and personable in all their transactions. Overall, it was a great experience renting from them and if I'm ever living in Madison again, I'll look them up first! They are a little pricier than some other options, but every penny is worth it!"
"The mac and cheese pizza is only tasty of mac and cheese if it's fresh.  Otherwise it's dry, like regular mac and cheese.\n\nThe pizzas of the week keep this place fresh."
"Whew! They have beautiful things, really, but they are pretty pricey. While they have authentic pieces in good shape, it still seems like it's a bit on the steep side. Even their accessories were expensive (and, at least in the case of the radios, not guaranteed to work). I'd shop here if money were no object, but even for a middle-class home, things seemed out of reach, at least for me. But I'm giving it four stars because if you can afford their prices, you'll find some awesome stuff!"
"Yeah, I know there's a lot of haters. \n\nTo me -- it's my hometown airline, and since I travel often I'm fortunate to live in a hub city. \n\nYes, I have experienced my share of cancelled flights, delayed flights, grumpy flight attendants, grumpy gate agents, etc, etc etc\n\nBut... I have also experienced many on-time flights, early flights, extremely friendly and caring flight attendants, extremely friendly gate agents, compassionate ticketing agents. \n\nAnd even amongst the good and the (really) bad, I'm still gonna consider myself a fan. \n\nBecause - - \nI like getting complimentary First Class upgrades for being Platinum\nI like being able to go standby on earlier flights same day (Plat perk)\nI like getting preferred treatment to my luggage (the rare occasion i check)\nI like getting free baggage (perk)\nI like that their flights are typically lower priced, when I'm traveling on my own dime\nI really like traveling in Envoy \nI like their partnership with Star Alliance\n\nI like all the perks... and trust me, it has taken many flights to earn them."

"Love to pass by this shop for some nicely priced back issues, I do not do my pull here because nothing is bagged and boarded first and its out of my way.  But they always have a lot of what I am looking for, sometimes not in NM condition, but beggars can't be choosers."
"Good sushi, but a little overpriced in my opinion. Also, they don't do brown rice which is kind of annoying. Overall pretty solid sushi joint. Gets busy around 7."
"I went in looking for a suit and didn't know how to put one together I spent about 30min doing it and realized there was no one around to even ask for help, I went to the fitting rooms where I found Keenan or Keesan sorry I forgot your name he helped me put a whole suit together I appreciate him going out of his way even though he was busy working on the clothes people just leave in the fitting rooms thanks definitely come back and I know who to look for"
"My cat Pikachu ran away for six weeks and luckily my brother found him eventually. He was very dehydrated, under weight, and of course very stressed.  They worked with us to get him feeling better immediately and to figure out what other conditions he may have.  I don't make a lot of money and am very grateful to them for working with me financially while not making any shortcuts in bettering my kitty.  The doctor made time to talk to me and go over my options and the receptionists worked to make it as affordable for me as they could. I'll be forever loyal to them for being there for those who don't have a lot just as much as for those who can afford it.  I especially appreciate this being as I am a pet sitter and work at a doggie daycare as well as do rescue work on the side.  A lot of my money goes to pets."
"Oh the weather outside is frightful, but the shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e was so delightful... I have been in Madison a bunch recently for work and will miss it solely because I won't get my shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e and corn bread anymore!\n\nI found this place when I was staying at the hotel next door.  The next time I came out to Madison I was staying in Middleton but still had to make the trip to get my fix.\n\nI got the jambalaya here too and that was also amazing but it's just difficult to put into words the flavor of the \u00e9touff\u00e9e.  It has the perfect amount of spicy in it without tasting overdoing it like a lot of hot sauces and spicy things you get these days.  Absolutely perfect meal. Amazing flavor.. Couldn't ask for more!  I'll probably come back tomorrow. Seriously.."
"I don't know why people are hating on Sonny's.  \n\nDon't go into it expecting a super classy meal or anything high end.  I think of Sonny's as the TGIFridays or Applebees of BBQ, meaning that it's consistent, tasty, and suited for every palate.  But that doesn't mean it's horrible.  My typical order is the pulled pork sandwich on Texas toast.  It's delicious slathered in their sweet sauce.  \n\nI've never had cold food or bad service at this location and I know I'll be back the next time I'm in town."
"It seems like most other folks who stayed here, I got my room on priceline (for $50). I was also rather annoyed that priceline considers this hotel to be downtown Madison -- but that was my fault for not looking closer at the map, not the hotel's fault.\n\nThis is a great hotel though. The rooms are big and comfortable. Parking and wifi are free (as are cribs). Service as friendly and quick (almost over the top). They have a nice pool and a free shuttle service (that I did not use).\n\nI also like that if you forgo maid service you get a $5 voucher that you can use at the restaurant or starbucks."

"My sister took me to the ER after I spoke to a nurse. I had a stabbing pain in my chest that lasted more than 16 hours. I was taken right in. Immediately, they started working on me. I had an IV, all the heart monitors, etc. They brought in an X-ray machine, I saw a doctor and then a heart specialist. After and echocardiogram I spoke again to the specialist Dr. Moses. The treatment was so fantastic. No bodies laying in the hallways of the busy ER. People moved quickly, and were very attentive. If anyone in my family needs an ER, it will be Meriter not UW or St. Mary's."
"i was brought up catholic, so it almost seemed sacrilegious for me to be guzzling  beer in a former spiritual sanctuary.\n\nhowever, i thought the beer was good (the hef was my fave) and the interior is impressive. definitely worth the experience."
"Pin Kaow does a lot a real good Thai dishes...almost everything I've ever had here was better than average.  The problem is that there isn't one dish that I want to come here for specifically.  I have 6 or 7 Thai dishes that I eat regularly and several more that I eat when I want to change things up, and in every case I can think of somewhere else I'd rather go...it's weird, but true.  They probably do massaman or panang best in my opinion.  I do hear that their Pad Thai is real good, but it's not something that I normally order and haven't had it from Pin Kaow in many years, so I can't truly confirm that .\n\nStill I will gladly come here, especially with a group because I know that the overall quality will be good and has always been consistent.\n\nThe service is friendly and they are quick....especially during the lunch rush."
"Visiting a new city for work means a steep learning curve for every need and amenity you have.  From finding out where to get your laundry done to finding what restaurants cater to vegetarians, it's a chore.  I got lucky in that this gem is 5 minutes form my hotel, and fantastic.\n\nThey have Cambodian dishes I've not seen before, and are faithfully spiced as opposed to suburbanite mild.  Everything is available in a tofu or vegetable option, and the sauces aren't greasy or loaded with MSG and thickener.   I highly recommend the garlicky eggplant or the tofu and chive flowers.  Their fresh spring rolls (elsewhere called summer rolls) are delicious and full of fresh basil.  Best of all, the owners sit in the dining area and make sure the customers are happy.  Wonderful people, delicious food, great art on the walls.  Overall, my favorite secret hidden gem in Pittsburgh."
"300 East is in a great space, and the menu offers up a little something for everyone. But little hiccups all around held things back from greatness.  For example, big personal pizzas were great, but the oily bath that collected beneath the slices? Not so great.  A few solid local beers but not a stand-out beer or cocktail menu.  Overall, good upscale casual dining, but a long ways from greatness."
"The location is a tad scary especially in the evenings as we've been hit up for money several times. Obviously that's the part I hate. \nAs for the custard itself, it's always great. It tastes like it's made with quality ingredients & I've never had anything that I didn't like. \nWhen we're downtown we usually make a stop & it's always satisfying. \nThey have a wide range of toppings & I happen to have a sweet tooth so I love most of them, especially the caramel, fudge & marshmallow ones."
"""Hnngh.\nhuuuuuuhhhhhhh.\n\nFried chicken, waffle, greens, catfish. Can never move again. I am OK with that. Ordered one piece of catfish, two came out, \""""because they were a little small\"""".

Yeah this is what you're trying to achieve. Please come take notes.\n\nThis is a silly thing to be happy about, perhaps, but I am always slightly irritated when I get a 6oz plastic tumbler stuffed with ice and a few drops of water. I drink water, a lot of it, and I don't normally get other drinks. Good service, an extra cup, a pitcher at the table, these are all things that can mitigate this. Lo-Lo's sidesteps it completely by providing 1L mason jars of water (I believe I saw kool-aid too) by default. I didn't even need a refill.\n\nI was so massively over-full that I couldn't try the red velvet cake but I'm almost considering driving back down there and getting a piece to go, the way other yelpers go on about it."""
NEVER had a bad time here. This is my first review
"It was a bachelorette party.  We were in Vegas.  We HAD to do a strip club.  Its tradition.  So I was told.  And who the hell am I to argue with tradition?\n\n$20 cover, 2 drink minimum, but I don't think they inforced that with the other girls in my party.  Standard drink prices, $25 minimum if you use your credit card.  Whatever, I came to see hot men and drink anyway!\n\nLadies, I think I fell in love about 5 times in 2 hours.  I think that's how long we were here.  For $35 we got our girl up on stage and she got a lap dance.  A good one too.  Most of the guys we saw were very entertaining and very hot.  They were probably gay but hey, hot is hot.  \n\nMy uh, friend got a lap dance and it was fantastic!  I mean, that's what she told me.  ;)\n\nCome on, it's a strip club!  It's fun!  It's entertaining!  It's hot!"
"After being disappointed by my last experience here (see yesterday's 2-Star update), I whipped back up there today with the bike, to gripe.  The technician corrected the 2 problems to my satisfaction with a good attitude & even replaced a worn cable at no charge, so I'm back to being a fan of Landis Cyclery!     :-))"
"My driver was friendly and courteous, pointing out the different routes I could take and how long they would take. I wanted to tip him but I had unfortunately not clicked the right options on the credit card pad. My driver was till very polite and said he understood. I feel awful that I didn't have any cash on me, but at least I can let others know about my good experience. It was cab 7775 by the way."
"I came here for dim sum on a Sunday last month. Even for a restaurant of its size (not tiny), it was crowded (with locals or tourists, I couldn't tell - well, not without staring!), so do arrive early to secure a table. Unsure if they take reservations.\n\nService was difficult to flag over for help, but when we did attract them, they were happy enough to oblige our random requests for more hot sauce, photos (!), and, of course, more food. Speaking of the food, their dim sum plates were tasty and totally worth it:\n- scallop dish was flavorful (first time I've had it too!)\n- black bean spare ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender\n- love the blankets\n- dumplings were tasty and well-filled\n- chicken feet were goooood\n- tofu dessert (made in-house) was surprisingly good\n\nNot sure about all the negative press for this place, but I had a delicious time at Cathay House. Recommended!"
"We didn't have a lot of hope for Thai food in the QC.  Oh don't give me that look.  True, maybe we were being prejudgemental.  Okay yeah we were.  Thai Taste is a sweet deal.  Plenty of food in a serving, yummy Pad Thai (spelled Pud Thai here) and yellow curry (you know, the more mild one with a heavy coconut influence), modestly priced, maybe 10-15 for dinner.  Lunch specials seem to be quite a steal, for under 10 bucks you get a hefty entree with spring roll, soup and that nectar of the gods, Thai iced tea.\nThe place has busy Thai art on the walls, plastic on the tables, and a fairly authentic feel overall so come on and enjoy yourself.  Also their website is cute.  Check out the staff photos."
I come for the pizza($1.99 a slice) or the Polish dogs ($1.50 for a dog and a drink). Can you all tell me where to get a better deal..... i didn't think so.
"I hate coming to this place, but the amazing staff makes it a little easier."
"So sue me...I like a chain once in a while.  I mean c'mon, decent coffee, comfy seating, free wifi and more than passable lunches.\n\nWould you hate me if I told you I knew where pretty much every Panera was from Connecticut to Maine?\n\nSeriously.  Can I write one generic review and just post it for all of them?  I mean chains go for consistent theme and product, shouldn't consistent reviews with a certain sameness be bestowed upon them if they succeed?\n\nIs the Panera just off the Maine turnpike in Augusta where I ate dinner and worked late one evening that different than the Panera in between the Connecticut turnpike and the Merritt Parkway or the Panera just off of Fort Eddy Road in Concord, New Hampshire?  Frankly, no it's not."
"I love to eat here during the day, but never on crowded nights or weekends when you don't get any service. The stars are for the sushi chefs of course and their attention to their customers. The waiters still suck."
"Ok, let me preface this review with a couple things that bug me: They charge $.50-$1 extra to use your debit card, whichever they feel like charging at the time. Also, they raise their prices on a consistent basis...sad face.\n\nHowever...the food here is AMAZING and is worth putting up with the above 'problems'. My favorites are the Americano Burrito for breakfast (egg, bacon, potato, ham and maybe I'm missing an ingredient) and the Super Nachos (tons of cheese, sour cream, carne asada, pico and guac if you want, layered perfectly atop a stack of perfectly crisped home made chips) for lunch and dinner.\n\nI am guilty...I have eaten here three times in one day before. It's just THAT good!\n\n:)"
"Oyster Po' Boy is simple and subtle yet delicious.  Their potato salad lives up to their hype as well.  On the other hand, I've been disappointed in some of their other sandwiches (notably the shrimp po' boy).  \n\nThe bread is really good in its own way but I agree sometimes there's too much of it.  \n\nOverall I'd be sad if they weren't around to give me my fried oyster fix every once in a while."
"I'm so disappointed that it has taken me this long to go in a Kohls! This location is a bit difficult to get to, but parking is plentiful! When I walked in the juniors section was immediately on my right and I steered very clear of that section. Some of those shorts wouldn't even fit around my thigh. I digress, the women's clothing selection is huge. It is a wide range of clothing that I feel encompasses young professionals to my grandmothers style as well. I love a store like that. My favorite part is they have rock and republic! The prices weren't falling over cheap but they did have some sales as well as a coupon. \n\nThe store also has a great skin care area and has a little bit of a mix of high end and low end skin care. I could have spent hours in this store and tried on way more than I actually did. The selection of clothes make it a great one stop shop. I am glad I stopped in and discovered a new love for the store!"
"Been twice-1 dinner,1 lunch. Unbeatable lunch price- I was really just going in for sushi, and barely ate that due to the vast selections. I ate things I don't identify/recognize. \nDinner time I had fried, skin off frog legs, which exceeded my expectations. Loved the garlic clams and mayo mussels to no end!! Good soups (didn't try the oxtail; a little unusual for me, maybe next time.)\nCan't wait to go back. :)"
"""I'm still not sure I \""""get\"""" the whole Chicken and Waffle  as a food combination, but I guess the question is: do I really need to? \n\nI've read that you may have to wait in line. Luckily that has not been the case for us as we've gone on off-peak hours: Wednesday night for dinner around 6pm and a Friday afternoon late lunch (1pm) . \n\nService has always been pleasant and the meals have come out on a timely basis.  And, hands down, Lo Lo's makes the best waffle...ever.  I think what makes it special is the  touch of Cinnamon. \n\nI ordered the Betty Boop (a chicken breast and a waffle) - definately enough to fill you up.   My husband orders a couple of drum sticks, waffle, fried okra and corn bread.  He can't help himself, his family is from the south and he likes to re-live his youth.  Too bad his metabolism has moved on...."""

"I've had a hard time finding a slice of pizza that doesn't dissolve under the weight of its own cheese and grease since moving to Pittsburgh but I finally lucked out with the white pizza from Napoli Pizzeria in Squirrel Hill. The crust isn't too thick but is crisp enough to keep its shape and toppings, the blend of olive oil, garlic and spices makes me forget about red sauce entirely, and even though it's perfectly delicious with just a cheese topping, nearly any of the other 20 topping choices would make for a great meal, too. The only thing that would make it better is if goat cheese was on the menu. \n\nI wouldn't recommend eating in, though. The dining area is cramped and loud and the counter set-up makes it difficult to get to. Besides, this is one of the few pizza places in Squirrel Hill that will actually deliver--so embrace your inner laziness and eat it on the couch."
"I've been by this place a thousand times but didn't know it existed. Its tucked away where you can't see it from Providence Road. I needed to kill an hour and grab a quick bite to eat, and thus got on Yelp to find something in the area. I stopped in and sat at the bar, and got a Goose Island IPA (pretty tasty) and the crab cake appetizer (amazing). The bar tenders were friendly, and they have 2 TV's in the bar area. The restaurant looks very nice and a little more upscale than the typical casual dining fare. I look forward to revisiting for a sit down dinner. Also, a good place to spend an hour if you need to in the area."
"No one ever likes going to a hospital [in my opinion]... it's usually of necessity, but I'm glad this one is close by in Matthews.  Had a recent visit to the ER late at night for one of my family members here so I spent a lot of time in the waiting room.  Luckily it was just a gash that needed stitches.... but based on my family member's experience this is a good place to go.  The doctors were very nice and thorough.\n\nMost of my experience was in the waiting room, which was kept clean... but had public access cable on the tv (strange, but I guess it was late night anyway)."
"""I went into Moe's today and didn't get the usual \""""WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!\"""" and you know what? That made me sad. Have they stopped doing this? I've always enjoyed being yelled at when I walk into an establishment but I guess others don't.\n\n Anywho, this is a pretty standard Moe's but it's baller status in my book because they have an outdoor patio on the side. Plus they give you free chips and have a variety of salsa to try. They even have one named the El Guapo and any salsa named after a character in Three Amigos rocks my world. Definitely stop in for Moe Monday--burrito, chips and a drink for $5--nothing wrong with that!"""

A lot of them don't speak the best english, so it's good to make sure you either a) tell them what you want in Spanish or b) repeat your order SEVERAL TIMES.  I had issues with them always putting onions on my tacos/burritos but now have it down to a science the best way to prevent this.  They tend to be a little forgetful and don't have fancy taco-bell-style video screens showing each order, so you gotta have a strategy if you're picky about your toppings.\n\nDefinitely not the best, and not really cheap either, but ... I'm hooked.  Open ridiculously late every night, too."""
Listen when people are coming to the ER it's  generally not in the best circumstances.  The triage nurses were so nice and comforting.  I checked in online and was triaged within 10 min of my scheduled time. My food poisoning wasn't more urgent than a woman starting labor so I waited but not that long and the waiting area was clean and comfortable. I will definitely choose spring valley again if needed.
"""While the quality of bread can't be beat, I kinda hate going in here.  The place is so tiny and the salesperson is usually so damn charming that I must buy something!  You walk in, they offer some samples, go over all the new breads and I feel like a total scumbag for being a moocher.  I always walk out with bread in hand.\n\nThe free baguette with a Yelp check-in is a pretty incredible offer.  I like any of the breads that contain bacon, sun-dried tomato, raisin, chocolate, cheese or onion.  So I guess I like every bread they got.  \n\nSince their items have no preservatives, this is \""""consume the day you buy\"""" stuff.  Otherwise the baguette could be used as a lethal weapon by the third day at home."""
Excellent service. But the fact that they don't offer alignment service is just more wear and tear on your tire's life.
"Subs. They've got 'em. The bread they use - is special, if you like it - you will like their subs, if you don't you will complain that the subs are weird. They do close pretty early, and many days they will close 15-30 minutes before it actually says they do, because they run out of bread.\n\nAlso, don't get your food to go - because if you eat it there - you get free fries with every sub, if you do takeout - you gotta pay for those fries (and they only take cash, and I mean you can't really even pay for the fries since you never have enough cash with you anyway)."
"""Love this place! The food seem very authentic, it doesn't taste like a panda express or some other bull.

"""I tried a number of high-rated, supposedly hip and creative salons in town, only to be disappointed again and again by stylists that just didn't get me or what I wanted.

I even thought about commuting back to my stylist in LA for haircuts!\n\nI've been going to Globe for probably 2-3 years now and am ever-so-thankful that I finally found them!  Samantha is amazing!

"I only get to have dim sum with my daughter since the mister doesn't like it...so since my daughter now lives in Cali, I only get to have dim sum when she visits or when I have family in town.\n\nMy first choice is Chang's but if I have to be on Spring Mountain to shop then Cathay House is my next choice.   The dim sum here is good, better than some of the other places in Vegas but I grew up in SF so its too hard to compare as I've had some of the best back home...\n\nGet there early as after a certain time, there is only limited things you can get since they stop making dim sum by afternoon."
"When you're talking chicken & waffle places, no matter what, it'll always have to stack up against Roscoe's. It may not be fair, but that's how it's gotta be. I've also been to chicken & waffle places up and down the west coast, so I know what I'm talking about here. In the end, nothing quite stacks up to the OG, Roscoe.\n\nStill, doesn't mean that Lo-Lo can't throw in a contender. And quite a contender it is. His sendup of the classic most definitely works for me. Fluffy waffle, and tender fried chicken doused in Louisiana-style hot sauce. That's what I'm talking about. Can't forget the mac & cheese either, which was a very healthy portion. \n\nThe food is good, but what won me over? Lemonade. Unlike Roscoe's, Lo-Lo's will refill your lemonade. Can't go wrong with that. Service was fantastic, and even with a half-hour wait on a Friday night, everyone was still pleasant and happy. Just wish I wasn't so full to try that red velvet cake.\n\nNo one will ever step to Roscoe, but Lo-Lo and Sandra Dee in Sacramento are more than qualified contenders to the title."
"Having moved to Seattle in 2006, I was disappointed on a recent visit home to see a lot of my favorite bars have already changed.  (sofas at the Lava Lounge in place of their pool table!?!  Hungry Kids and family's ruining a good depressing happy hour at Micky's on Willy st?!?)  So it's refreshing to know that you can still go to the Paradise Lounge on a weeknight and get into the same crazy drunken funny situations you come to expect at a place like this. God bless you Paradise. Stay sweet, never change."
"I've lived in a number of cities around the U.S. and around the world, and Pittsburgh definitely punches above its weight in the realm of libraries. Every time I go in, I feel bad for Barnes and Noble because I only need my library card to take a book home for three weeks at a time.\n\nOf course, books are only the beginning of the story, since the library has a great selection of DVDs, CDs, magazines, and archival material as well.\n\nAll of this is completely apart from the experience of walking up the steps of the main entrance of this Beaux-Arts masterpiece. Sometimes the pure force of the architecture draws me in.\n\nAs of 2009-2010, the library system's funding has been threatened with cuts, which have mostly affected neighborhood branch locations rather than the headquarters, but I've been happy to write to my government officials to ask them to support this treasure. Heck, on Tax Day this year, I didn't even resent writing a check to the City of Pittsburgh: I just thought about the next book I was going to get at the library."
It was a very busy day at the airport this morning.  Line at check in was very long that I decided to not check my luggage in.   \n\nLady (I think her name was Emma or Emily) at Gate 17 around 11am was very professional. She stayed calm despite the line that was getting long in front of her and her phones ringing off the hook.)  She handled my request to change my flight to an earlier one since my original flight has been delayed 1 hour.  Kudos to her!
"Really good food and reasonably priced. Don't even think about showing up without your entire party, even if theres only 2, they wont seat you, and parking is a pain."
"A friend and I frequent Bar Louie for happy hour during the week a few times a month, we recently started going to the station square location, the one at the water front is always insanely crowed, and the service there sucks..that being said we have never had a bad bar tender at the new location, and the 1/2 ap menu is defiantly worth the paid parking. the bruchetta and shrimp tempura are amazing, as well as the $5 martini menu."
I made an appointment to see Dr. Singel a week ago and just had my first meeting with him. He was very nice and knowledgable about what was wrong with my foot. I have congenial flat feet which means I have absolutely no arch in my foot. He told me my arches were slipping further and tearing the muscles. He did not even SUGGEST surgery which was very pleasantly surprising. He suggested custom inserts as I had already tried all the store's generic inserts which did nothing for me. \nI am very pleased with his service as well as his office's service. I would recommend him to anyone :)
"I like this place alot, esp for their plethora of screens and movie selections.  \n\nI will say, I went here on the Friday after Thanksgiving and they were far understaffed at both the ticket both and the concession stand.

"Recently I went to the Galleria mall to find a special item for my daughter who just lost her boyfriend in a terrible car crash.After spending almost two hours we almost gave up.Our last stop was The tower of Jewels.We told them what we were looking for,a mizpah type of heart.They didn't have one,but the manager and the craftsman said they would custom make it out of a flat piece of silver.I don't have enough words to tell you what that did for my daughter's broken heart.The next day I picked up my daughter's custom made heart.I was floored when the craftsman showed me how he hand sawed out the heart from the piece of silver with his hands.This company has my business for life.With out getting into to much detail,my daughter has half of the heart and the other half is in a very special place. .God bless you Galleria tower of jewels,I will never forget what you were able to for my daughter.\n\n  Gary"
"This place is classic Pittsburgh and I would probably send a journalist here rather than Primanti Brothers to give him a feel for 'old Pittsburgh'.  I've been going here since I was a kid.  It is dirty, cramped, low-ceilinged and dingy as the House of Usher, but the gyros are delicious.  Which is great since that's really your only option.  If you have an open lunch and are in the South Side, jump in here and enjoy a delicious unhealthy Pittsburgh tradition."
"I cut my teeth buying records at Jerry's almost 20 years ago. Jerry's is a giant space which can be overwhelming if you are not used to large record stores. I advise taking a list. For a while I would visit the shop weekly and still find stuff in the genre and alphabet bins a little stagnant. I'm not saying you won't find anything there, but if you look for something a few times and don't find it - you probably won't find. Part of the reason is the prices are so good, stuff does not stay on the shelves. The best place to look is the new arrival bin. Unfortunately the best stuff never hits the shelve, you can find it on eBay."
"""I've reviewed a couple Bojangles, because, well... let's face it... I should probably just LIVE at this establishment with as often as I frequent the place.

"Amsterdam was dead on Saturday, while Charlie's was packed and s***kickin.  The usual line dancing thing but strange how it was only 15 guys and a ton more watching, the other similar bars I have been to had half the crowd joining in.  Fun atmosphere with a big backyard and a run-down country bar feel, diverse crowd, more laid back people.  Waited forever for the next dance act but it took too long and we were tired.  The drinks only seemed to kick in after I got home, when I needed them least.  Still, something different than the usual sleek primpy crowd, fun!"
"I highly recommend Minit Maids. We were moving into a rental home that needed a deep clean.

The team got here first thing in the morning and finished about 45 minutes before the movers arrived. \n\nThe team did such a great job with the clean that we are now regular house cleanings.

"The men of OGs... *sigh*.  I can't imagine visiting Vegas without making a pit stop here for at least 2 hours.  I thought I was gonna cry last weekend after taking a peek into my clutch and realizing I left my ATM card at the hotel.  Looking back, it really was a blessing.  This place brings out the devil in me."
"Up side: Cheap beer. Cheap food. Vegetarian options on the menu.\n\nDown side: Smoking (might be an upside for some). Sometimes smells like hot farts.\n\nIt can get really crowded on weekends, but I like it."
"Found this place on Yelp and yes, it lives up to the hype. It looks like an old industrial building turned into a restaurant. However, that is by design. I must disagree with one previous post about not having 'healthy' options. Egg substitute, Canadian bacon, wheat or dry toast, grits without butter, etc are all options on the menu. Of course I got the Western omelet & a side of corned beef hash! Off tha hook. Nice view of uptown Charlotte and an outdoor seating area plus excellent service (thanks, Amy G.) make this an awesome breakfast or lunch place to visit."
"If you do not care how clogged your arteries get and have Ok blood sugar then pig out....I would not call this a good Cajun restaurant but it is on the cusp of Cajun.

I'm not sure how to review a discount club. Aren't they all the same? It is always clean here. The staff is always helpful. They usually have what I'm shopping for. I've never had any kind of negative experience here. What else can I say? I've gone here for years and will continue.

"Used the ATM without any charges here.  Alright!\n\nThis Costco is pretty small  The layout is not like any other Costco.  It reminded me of an actually warehouse, like a Home Depot layout or something.  This location had a lot of sales.  My friend and I wanted to load up and take things home to CA, but knew we couldn't because we had no space in the van.  We came on a Saturday.  There were no samples at all.  Not sure if we were too early, or they just do serve it here.  We bought our things and were on our way.  The lines were really short too.  We decided to drop by the next day to fill gas.  We were shocked to see the parking lot so dead and to find out this Costco location is closed on Sundays.  What a shame..."
Big building with a drive-thru drop off area. Takes the larger items that the trailers on the side of the road can't.\n\nHuge selection of clothes.\n\nGives receipts for taxes.
"Got picked up from LAS in Vegas and wanted to go to MGM Grand. Quick trip, cabbie was polite and social enough without being awkward. He did, however, park right in the middle of the walkway to let me out, which caused me to almost get hit."
"I've been in this store 1.3 million times.  We've done a lot of home and garden work over the last couple years, and try as you might, it's hard to find an alternative to the Home Depot/Lowes scene.  But I've always found that the prices are slightly better at HD.  And I prefer the color orange over blue.\n\nI've always found the people working there to be helpful, especially in the lumber department, where they'll cheerfully cut what you need to your specs.\n\nMy only complaint is that THEY ARE SO F***ING BAD AT COPYING KEYS THAT IT BLOWS MY MIND!!!!!  Keys that I've had made there have about a 50% chance of actually working.  And when you get home and realize the key doesn't work, how likely are you to go back and get your $2 back or have another key cut that likely won't work either.\n\nSo anyway, don't get keys made here.  Otherwise, it's all good in the hood."
"Being a stingy storage monger, I called around a bit until I landed on Iron City - the prices were reasonable, it's clean, climate controlled, and easy to get to on Bigelow. The guys were friendly, they do a month-to-month contract (no cancellation fees) and they can auto-debit an account for you. There are also plenty of dollies and moving equipment to run out to your vehicle, if you are unable (like myself) to carry more than two boxes without risking your life. \n\n2 tips: \n1. Bring your own lock - I was a rookie, but didn't expect they'd charge something like $12 (I don't remember, but it was something I could've bought at Home Depot for $4) for a simple padlock. \n2. If you sign up for auto-pay, call after the first month and make sure they set it up correctly. Apparently the guy who i signed up with forgot to put my paperwork through, and they called me saying I owed them money. We fixed it right away, but just in case - follow up."
I wasn't impressed by my carne asada buritto-it was ok. I am VERY burrito picky! Some friends rave about this place-so I ordered what they get: the carnitas plate. I love it! It may break my burrito habit.\nNow if I could only find the perfect burrito in vegas.
Well the bartender wasn't very successful at making a good drink but the other one could and was cool about it. Scallops were great and the farmers grass fed steak was good. I wouldnt say great. But for a grass fed it was very tender which is a feat in itself. Should have just went with their normal steak to see what the fuss is about.
The buffalo flavored dip is excellent and doesn't have MSG.  Unfortunately it is now discontinued.

"I don't know if it was the fact that I had not had a donut in sooooo long... or the fact that I was thinking vegan would equal not quite as good, but whatever the reason these were DELICIOUS! Only negative I have is they were out of donut holes when I got there, but it was less than an hour before they closed so I guess that was my bad but I would have loved to try them... everything else we got was awesome though! I went here because of the reviews here on yelp and I'm glad I did we bought a dozen and had them for breakfast and dessert for about three days so that was sweet and they still tasted just as good. This is in a semi-seedy strip mall, but just go there and pick yourself up some donuts and you won't regret it! I agree with the previous poster who said for regular donuts these would be just good, but for vegan they are AMAZING! I also had the non-vegan sprinkle ones and they were awesome as well so I was not disappointed... thanks yelpers!"

I got here right at 9:00 hoping to beat the lines but there were already customers gettings cuts and a handful more waiting.I was glad to see they wlcomed walk-ins, as some shops are by appt. Only. I was a bit concerned, most of the barbers here are latino and I am of mixed race and my hair can be difficult to cut. I only waited 15 minutes before carlos called me to his chair, he understood what I wanted and got right to work. To my suprise he had no problems with my hair and was done in no time.

"Drive thru gets clogged quickly with caffeine addicts.\nThis being said the staff is on it like a rabbit in a hole.  They're fast, quick moving little bunnies aiming to please the heck out of those desperate caffeine addicts.\nThey keep the inside of this place clean if you ever get out of your car.\nIt's got the new updated look so it looks a bit too hip for Fitchburg.\nLast time I waited in line, they gave me a free coupon since it took so long.\nNo sweat Starbucky Bunnies, I'll be back."
"Always a good time, especially with a group. The staff is generally professional, although our last waitress missed my gf's request of water in addition to her drink multiple times.  The comedians can be hit or miss, but if someone out the crowd says something stupid they get ripped up which is always a plus. Not for the faint of heart squares. Loosen up man."
"I haven't actually been looking at Yelp prior to going to places lately, usually only afterward. \n\nI wonder why I've never bothered trying this place. Maybe it's because I have a couple sushi restaurants I already like. \n\nSean and I took our boyfriend here a few days ago. I really like the atmosphere, and most of the food we tried was amazing. It's rare to find really fresh fish here in Vegas, so having good stuff like this reminded me of some places we go to when we're at our place in Seattle. \n\nThe service is very friendly, though I find it odd that Korean people own a Japanese restaurant, and that only 2 staff are Japanese. Either way, with food this good, and service this good... two things that are hard to find for a decent price in Vegas... We'll definitely be back."
"""There are a few food categories that, being from LA, we maintained the snobbery of \""""there's no way that ______ is better in Madison.\""""  Mediterranean is not one of those things.

"Let me start off by saying that we'd tried to go to Rhino but were refused since we didn't have a male escort -- we might be professionals, you see.  We pretended to be indignant but I think we were a little flattered.  So anyway, we went to OG not knowing there were dudes there and super psyched to be welcomed.  100 bucks later I walked out with runs in my stockings from a saucy lap-dance from a very gay blonde man with the smoothest ass ever and a face smelling like cocoa butter from all dem stripper titties that were rubbed in it.  And my god, it was worth every penny -- 10x more fun than the classier clubs I've been to.  You can't be a prude (why are you at a strip club?) and don't let the pushy male dancers screw you around."

"I'm going to sound like a broken record, but the Western Sundae is heavenly, salty-sweet goodness in a paper cup! \n\nThe hole in the wall location, cash-only policy, and lack of seating speaks volumes about this place: it's all about the custard.

"After moving from the Rowland Heights area to Vegas, I was desperately in need of some yummy Chinese food.  The local Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood are awful!!!

Probably one of the best shrimp dishes I've had.  The rest was ok.  It wasn't nearly as good as the Asian cuisine found back in Cali, but the best in Vegas so far.

The Sa-Bai roll was pretty weird.  Volcano chicken was delicious.

I was quite nervous about the cat, and the girl at the front was not only knowledgeable, but kind and honest as well.

My friend recommended this place after asking about a decent place for milk tea.\n\nI ordered a taro milk tea with grass jelly at the price of $3.65 which is especially cheaper compared to other tea places. The only problem I had was the grass jelly. It was in pieces and looked like it came out of a can containing a very bitter and metallic taste. The milk tea itself was good and had a strong taro taste. Really regretted getting the grass jelly instead of boba, especially after I tried my sister's drink, raspberry slush w/ boba. \n\nOverall, just don't get the grass jelly."
"go here, don't get ripped off."
"Got another dozen from Ronald's this week, and i'm certain of 2 things: The worst donut and the BEST donut are to be found in all of Las Vegas here.\n\nI found out from the woman working there ALL of the top shelf donuts are the vegan ones. That's where the tiger tails are, the perfect cinnamon-chocolate gigantic twist donuts are. I love these SO much, plus they are very filling! I think this one donut is the tastiest one in town.\n\nThe wimpy, tasteless cake cinnamon crumb donuts are a total let-down. Heavy, greasy and devoid of any cinnamon flavor whatsoever. A real bummer, I wish they could be better.\n\nThey make a great maple bar!"
"Some of the people that rated this store don't have any idea of what Polish food is.Granted the store is quite small and limited as to inventory but the shelves are NOT empty,in fact quite full.The owners who work there are very helpful and polite.The selection of meats and sausages is always fresh the best blood sausage and ham in town.As to the AC it has been fixed and very nice place to shop."
"I went to Cabo in 2010 with my wife and it was just a bad night.  Neither of us liked it and we didn't return for two years.  That being said, I've missed out on two years where we could have enjoyed Cabo Fish Taco!  I went twice last week and both times it was fantastic!  Cheese dip was average, Guac was wonderful, BBQ Mahi and the Tavaroo tacos were phenomenal!  I'm excited to try some more new things soon!\n\n*quick edit update:  they are using wahoo right now in replacement of the tuna due to oil apparently.   Had the Tavaroo tacos again and it is still wonderful.  Wahoo is a white fish and it was very fresh.  Still a safe order!  :)"
"I cant think of one reason why this Mall would be rated anything else besides 5 stars.  It has all the department stores that you can ask for.  The worst one being Macy's (which I think ROCKS).  It has every store inside and a kick a** food court.  It even has a Cheesecake Factory and Maggianos attached.  If that wasn't enough, walk one min and shop at Crate & Barrel or Williams and Sonoma.  It has a googlaplex of options.  (Look up googalplex and you will know what I mean).  Enjoy.\n\n-Ian M"
"""Donuts were okay but nothing too spectacular as the hype makes it out to be.  Maybe reading the reviews here made my expectations go through the roof because I expected the sweet tender dough to have a hint of oh just enough hint of butter, sugar, and vanilla extract that just explodes in your mouth and take over my body kind of experience, similar to the infamous Herbal Essence shower commercial.  I was severely let down.\n\nThe way I see it is that the variety of donuts here are more of a novelty more than anything.  Although, the apple fritters are very good and the closest I got to getting that \""""Herbal Essence\"""" experience.  They would probably the only thing I would come back for."""
"I love this target. I've never gotten any rude customer service!  It's in a very nice, well lit area. The only problem I can see is a issue that needs to be brought up by the town of matthews. The turning lane off 51 is always backed up! They really need to fix the light!"
"I usually do not trust Oil change places. I was told so much BS about what I need, like a $300 battery, $500 worth of new hoses and belts... \nWell my dear Ex happens to be a mechanic and I know for fact I didnt need any of this crap since he just did it. Exept the battery, but I know I can buy one at Autozone for under $120 and its installed in 5 minutes! WTF\n\nAnyways. I went there, being ready to get ripped off but to my surprise, nothing happened! The guys were awesome, they said that he would recommend some service soon but I was fine to drive all the way to texas and get it done at next service. \nDude... thats awesome! \n\nThe batteries needed replaced, yes, they were like 4 years old. Instead of upselling they send me to Autozone to get it and bring it back they would install it for $10."
"Excellent Irish pub. Great beer selection and great food, including weekend brunch.  Unfortunately I went in the middle of a soccer game and apparently this is where all the soccer fans in Pittsburgh go to watch!  So I had to wait over an hour for a table but it was worth it.  I was a little frustrated people were just sitting at the tables not ordering anything to watch the game while my friend and I were actually there to order food, but it seemed to be a special event and probably not typical.  Awesome scotch eggs and boxty.  The atmosphere is also your typical Irish pub."
"I called in and made an appointment even though they take walk ins. I just really hate waiting. As soon as I picked out a polish, my technician was waiting for me. The massage chair (which, in reference to another review, they did install more) was phenomenal and the hot stones were great. The polish was done beautifully and, after my manicure and pedicure was done, she waxed my eyebrows really quickly. Great shape on the brow, couldn't be happier. There was a nice set up for the drying, both toes and fingers at the same time. A quick set spray and a shoulder massage made the dry time pass extremely quickly. Will definitely be returning!"
"Okay, it smells weird in here - musty church + beer brewing? But the atmosphere and the awesome beer and food make up for it.\n\nPierogies are awesome, the pierogie pizza is good (is it sacrilege that I want to add bacon or sausage to it?) The seven onion soup is heavenly as is the bread pudding.\n\nAs for the beer, I can only comment on the Millenium Trippel because once I had it, I did not want for anything else. It was that good. \n\nMinus a star for Pepsi products....(when I ask for a Coke, tell me you have Pepsi so I can change my order. I can tell.)"
"These guys are seriously great. I moved down to Charlotte from Maine, and this place was recommended. I have a '97 Lincoln Town Car, and it had a myriad of problems. They charged me a very low labor fee to figure out what was wrong with my lights. I'd brought it to multiple garages and they could never figure it out. Well Buffalo tire did, though I wasn't willing to pay for the replacement part since it was worth more than my car. Instead, Louis (my favorite mechanic), worked some 'voodoo' on my car and now my lights work better with just a few minor adjustments, so I can live with my car's handicap until the end of its life. Louis is the best mechanic I've ever had to deal with - I'd ask for him if you go there. Great customer service as well, though don't mind Tom - he's just a bit of a curmudgeon. Also very accommodating, and free wi-fi, so bring your laptop for those long waits."
"""I went there again for dinner in a group of 4. We had a group dinner for 4, \""""Mixed Mazza\"""". It includes:\npita --a meager amount. Too dry and too flat.\nspreads -- hummus, baba ghanouj (good), m'hamara (red pepper spread). \nsauces -- yogurt sauce and tahini.\nappetizers -- falafel, kibbee ball (fried rice + meat), beef sambosia (triangular flaky pastry with beef filling), yalangi (stuffed grape leaves appetizer), olives & pickles.\ndishes -- Fool (onion & tomato saucy stuff), tabouli, chicken liver, lamb shawarma. \n\nFor the price of $57, I think it is pretty worthwhile. Every dish is good but I wish the pita was up to par with the dishes. They could have provided more pita, too.\n\nHot tea that is complimentary from the house. Similar as before, there was only 1 waiter bustling. Poor guy. I'd like my tea to be refilled a lot more frequently though."""
"Melt-in-your-mouth food...and close to my office! Bring cash, though...no plastic!"
"I am rarely a department store shopper by any stretch of the imagination, and now that I mention it, I am not much of a shopper of any kind.  It has also been years since I have been to a Nordstrom.  Probably since I lived in Seattle and their logo was the one of the all lowercase, computerized font.  I think they dropped that in the early nineties (though I actually left Seattle long before that happened).  So it has been a while.\n\nRegardless, this Nordstrom is actually quite nice.  Even the logo.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, and even if you do not have your receipt, they are more than happy to take your return and make sure that you get something you like in exchange - generally at a slightly higher price, of course."
"The donuts are killer. Delicious. Get dressed at 11 p.m. and pile in the car to get donuts kinda donuts. Service is spotty, and I've been in there a couple times and they had no glazed donuts. No glazed donuts, really? Otherwise, definitely a place to go."
"I was shocked to find out I have not reviewed Marche Bacchus prior.  I have been a regular here for years and guess I have always forgotten to submit a review. Having said that, it is well over due and deserving of my reserved 5 Star rating.  The service, scenery and setting is deserving of 4 stars alone, but the food pushes it on to 5 stars.\n\nMy most recent visit was just for a quick lunch, but we enjoyed ourselves so much we ended up spending a few hours just enjoying the scenery and ambiance.  The staff is very friendly and efficient without being over bearing and ever present.  I haven't tried everything on the menu as of yet, but everything I have tried has more than satisfied.\nIf you are looking for a quiet place for lunch, or a romantic setting for dinner you can't miss with Marche Bacchus."
"I had been waiting to try this place for YEARS since coming to town from Raleigh for a concert, but its always so packed when we're there. I finally discovered they do take out, so we by-passed the hour wait (at 8:30 on Friday night) and ordered food at the bar. We got chips and the amazing tomatillo salsa while we waited, and luckily, by the time the food came out (which wasn't long), two seats opened up at the bar and we got to eat there. And lemme tell you... It was well worth the wait. The beer battered tacos were out of this world. My husband had the mahi, which I liked on its own, but liked my taco more. The avocado pasta salad was the winning side- my black beans and rice were a little bland. But overall, it definitely lived up to the hype!"
"""We had reservations for this place on a Saturday night.  Take an elevator ride up from inside Harrah's.  We show up and it was dead as dead could be. More like half full, but what do you expect.  Harrah's casino isn't exactly the go-to destination for a nice dinner.   I was like, \""""Great D, this place is going to suck goat balls.\""""\n\nWe get seated and have a view of the strip.  They bring out an array of rolls, flatbread, and pretzel rolls.  Pretzel rolls?! Ah damn kiddo, things are looking up! The atmosphere was laid back, not all pretentious and sh!t.  Still maintaining that steakhouse feel.  So that was kinda refreshing, in a cold beer on a hot summer day kinda way.\n\nWe order the bone-in ribeye with kind crab legs.  Everything was on point. No complaints what-so-ever.  Our server, an older gentleman, was funny as hell. \n\nCan I have a bag full of those pretzel rolls to go please?"""
"had i written about this place after my 1st experience i would say it's way over priced & crappy food. the first time out we ordered corned beef hash omelette & salami & eggs. we were not expecting what we got. an enormous portion. had to be 8-10 eggs used. the hash was good but the salami & eggs was bad-sliced salami cooked into eggs-yuck!!! the waiter wasn't very helpful about asking if we had ever been,etc.\n\nnow the 2nd trip we decided to stick with the pancakes & boy were they good. mine was practically a cinnamon apple pie & it was sooooo good. a little pricey $50 for 3 people for breakfast. i'd recommend sticking to the pancakes & waffles & fresh squeezed oj."
"No butcherie has a very friendly staff, it's just the way it is. But I don't care...all the looks I get from the Orthodox women in their long skirts and me in my leggings and sweatshirt, won't keep me at bay. The food is delicious. Buying my food for Pesach was a cinch and instead of being starving this year I am stuffed! The Waldorf Chicken Salad is TDF and my fiance LOVES their Matzah Balls (which are ginormous)."
"This was a quick trip for me, I just needed to have a key made. I won't lie I'm not a frequent hardware store shopping....only for the occasional spare key or a gift card for my dad who is obsessed with fixing things....you will rarely find me in here!\n\n However, that being said this was a very nice trip! The service was fast, the associate who made my key asked about my day and was very informative. Overall the place looked clean, the associates were helpful and I was out with my new key in no time!"
They were WONDERFUL in January...now it's June and facing heatwave this weekend and A/C is not blowing cold air. Dekes is my FIRST call!
"You have to bring your patience card when you go to Burlington.  They have LOTS of stuff to distract you.  I went in for a coat and was constantly distracted by other items (toys, shoes, housewares, knick knacks, etc.) before I got to the coats section.  At that time, I realized I needed a cart.  All settled in, I spent quite a lot of time going through ALL OF THE COATS to find the perfect one, as requested by my daughter.  When she saw the coat, she was pleased.  I was able to get out of the store with minimal damage to my finances.  Burlington is definitely the place to go for coats.  Use your patience card to find the right one for the right person."
Great food. Always prompt. Service is good. The cheap margaritas are decent for 1.75. I've had tamales on 3 different occasions here and I cant say I have enjoyed any of them. There always ends up being a dry and hard on one end. Not sure what the issue is/was. the last time I had one there they covered it a green chile sauce. I think to rehydrate maybe. But everything else I've had has been excellent. The gyro meat platter thing is a little odd though.
"Came for the awesome shakes & fries. We usta come here sit at the front window & watch cars & ppl. But there were too many transient ppl here slummin & loitering. Came here today tables clean, quiet, organized & helpful. I ordered the vanilla shake real thick & flavorful. Gson got the strawberry shake he could barely get the thick ice cream through the straw. The fries were crispy on the outside yummy on the inside."
"Unique (well, there's the Mon one), kitchey, functional (locals grumbled as our tour of PIT trolleys made its final stop, and hampered their uphill commute home...). Come on it's only $2, and the view from the top is spectacular. Our guys had to be pryed outa the machinery room, but that's just the Society for Industrial Archeology..."
"Ok so I am updating my review because since January I didn't look for work. But end of march I put my resume out on Monster, Indeed and few other websites because the place I was working was a joke and miserable. And to my delight my Resume written by RC at AAA resume got hits right away from interested employers I started interviewing and I also walked it in some auto dealerships old school like. 2 weeks later I am working at my new job auto industry doing exactly what I wanted. RC took my over 14 yrs of office work experience and made me very attractive to employers. I had 5 interviews in 1 week and am still getting employers calling but I'm so happy with my new job I won't be going anywhere. Good pay + benefits happy co-workers. And lots of compliments on my beautiful resume. Thanks RC and staff."
I had my secret 1st wedding here YEARS ago.  (long story... got in trouble for it then cuz I was 20 and he was 33... let's not go there.  Let's just say the marriage didn't last. lol) \n\nNice place... very classical weddingish.  The photographer was great... my then groom and I had some beautiful photos taken of that day. :)
"Yeah, it's a bit dive-y. Yeah, the bathrooms are small. Yeah, it's nothing special. But so what, I like it. \n\nI can see how this place doesn't seem very attractive to passer-by's, with trendy places like The Icon popping up downtown. It gets better if you keep coming back. To me, it's simply that bar where everybody knows your name."
"Yes, they are slow, but the food is cooked to order in a small kitchen!  It's worth the wait......so think about chillin while you wait. If they tried to rush you out to boost their volume, you would be mad about that!"
"I went here after my over-the-counter regime stopped working and my breakouts wouldn't go away. I went to Dr. Swartz, who was SO nice and very helpful. The wait was a bit long, but it was worth it...I can see why she is so busy! She just looked at my face, asked me some questions, opened her cabinet, and told me what to do. So far, it seems to be working well, she appears to have known what she was talking about. I was recommended this place by a friend and I gladly recommend this place to everyone else!"
"Let me start by admitting to not being a big Applebee's guy. The food is ~okay~ and I've had terrible experiences at other locations. Not at this one, however. It has been slow, but even then it wasn't due to server inattentiveness. I would definitely suggest bringing a light sweater because even in July, it's too cold in there. I love the staff here; our waitress last time was perfection. Plus: liquor. Happy hour here WINS. My MAIN issues with it is the temperature, and the fact that it can get very, very loud in there very quickly. And if you are one of the poor sobs that gets there during a dinner rush, I'll light a candle for you."
"I've been going here for years and now just getting around to write up my review. I suck, I'm sorry.\n\nIf your looking for a fabulous neighborhood cafe with amazing food, homemade breads, great wine/beer selection, and a live pianist. Add those up[ and that equals a relaxing evening worth every penny. I said penny and not the dollar cause its pennies what you spend. For the quality of food and the atmosphere, its cheap. Their chicken wrap is magical and My Florist Cafe is the only place, that I know of, where it is acceptable for a grown adult to order a PBJ. Nomerous times I have ordered it and never have I felt embarrassed. This cafe is in the perfect location, close to SideBar, and has great food. You HAVE to go!"
"If I'm going to have a pizza it's not going to be Pizza Hut or Domino's. I want something made from scratch preferably baked in an oven from Italy. This is what you get a Luisa's.\n\nTheir flavors are simple, clean and fresh. I have to fight my boyfriend for bites of lasagna. Their wines by the glass are reasonably priced and they have a pretty ok craft beer selection.\n\nPasta entrees come with a salad and garlic bread that is garlic butter pizza crust,\n\nThey must bake love into their pies because you can certainly taste the care. \n\nService can be a scotch slow but I keep on coming back from the heart and stomach filling pizzas."
"On my first visit here I wasn't expecting much. I was actually a little hesitant to go inside because the parking lot & surrounding area Is a bit sketchy but glad i did. I found some cute, like new dresses from Kimchi Blue, H & M, Ann Taylor Loft, BCBG and Hollister.  Staff are always friendly & helpful."
"I would have given them 5 stars if I had reviewed 6 months ago, but they have changed the menu a little... I used to dream about their old duck fat hash. The perfect medley of savory and breakfasty and just plain deliciousness (loved the kale and grains!). Their new version isn't nearly as amazing, but I'm also not a huge fan of sweet potatoes and I think I'm in the minority there. Still good, but not my favorite.\n\nThe good thing about the menu change is that I now get to try new things!! Their biscuits and gravy--awesome. Their soups? Always great. I've never been unhappy with anything I've gotten, which is pretty great. I know this is a place I can get something and leave happy.\n\nMy only big caveat is that the iced tea is kind of expensive, and with a dollar per refill it's a little depressing. Love the flavors that they have but indulging my cravings means I feel like I've spent too much on brunch.\n\nTheir bread doesn't even really need a review--it's just perfect. Always. Grab a sample by the register. You won't regret it."
The shop closed in June of 2009
"This place was in Park Central and Christown Mall before Air Conditioning was invented. You cannot be around that long and not do something right. I give it 5 stars for quality and customer service. I use to eat there frequently, but now that I'm 44, I cannot eat this type of food as much. \n\nRating healthy choices is a whole other topic, but I think everyone knows what a NY deli is all about."
"""I have little to add, the best damn doughnut I've ever had, period.  And, for the reviewer or two who said things like \""""my grocery store has doughnuts too\"""", or \""""Dunkin Donuts has more variety\"""" I say please, stop shopping at Greenbush and take your stunted palette back to SAMs Club and leave the best for the rest of us.  More for me, that's what I have to say."""
This is no longer Liberty Lock and Key. It is the same location but is called Stanley Security Solutions.  I recently lost my car keys.  They have a transponder chip in them and Stanley Security Solutions now has a machine to program your key to your car.  I had two extra keys and the dealership wanted $159 to program EACH key. Stanley programmed each key for $45!!!! I will definitely use this business again.
"""I'm from Louisiana so I tend to be a bit critical of \""""Louisiana Kitchen\"""" places outside of the bayous of South Louisiana but these guys pretty much got it right.\nThe bourbon friend chicken w/ gumbo yaya was really quite good. They don't overdo the spices but the flavor is still strong.\nThe atmosphere is a little bit dive-y but overall, we really enjoyed it."""
"""I was in need of a battery for my Volkswagen Jetta TDI.  AutoZone is close to my house, so, I figured if I got the wrong type, I could return it easily.\nThe man at the counter was polite and helpful.  He did not treat me as a \""""mechanically challenged female.\""""  He offered to install my battery if I brought my car to the store, but I had help at home.  He did carry my battery to the car for me.\nI don't frequent auto part stores, but, if this had been a clothing boutique,  I would frequent it often.  In fact, some fancy-schmancy stores could learn big lessons in customer service from this gentleman.  He even gave me a rewards card.  If my head lights burn out, I won't hesitate to return."""
"Judging by the Yelp reviews, this place gets a bad rep, but it's really not that bad!!\n\nIf you want Hibachi that is cooked in front of you, go to Nakato. There, you pay for the show.\n\nIshi is a no frills, Japanese Hibachi place. I used to frequent here in college when I was low on cash and could get a good quality Japanese dinner for 5 bucks. You can't beat that.\n\nThe sushi isn't the best I've ever had, but it's not terrible either. I always get the Hibachi vegetables. I don't even normally like cooked carrots, but I find myself craving the cooked carrots here fairly often. Everything is always prepared and seasoned very well and the staff here is just as kind as can be!\n\nNow, I am PICKY about restaurant cleanliness and lose my appetite at even the smallest infractions...but honestly, that's never happened here. I've never seen anything cringeworthy.\n\nSo, stop hating on Ishi for being something it's not: an upscale hibachi grill.\nThis place is an essential for area college students. I wouldn't recommend coming here for a business meeting or a romantic dinner, but it is what it is!"
"Went again, cept for the 2 kimchi side dishes being closer to raw and not much pickled. Still good but might kinda hit or miss on the pickled sides."
I'm sorry but I cannot NOT give this place five stars. I know it's hood. I know it's cash only. I know it's host to many shady shady characters. I know this because I can't stop going back. It's all in the Jimmy Jack's experience! \n\nI'll tell you this. I've never been accosted by anyone here. The food has always been hot and the prices are a value. The ladies who work the window have always been friendly and prompt. And I've always been able to find parking and a place to sit here. What's there not to like?
You get what you pay for (cha-ching).  Delicious.  The end.
A 9+ only because I prefer the bark on slow smoked ribs ( I make my own ) every thing else was exellent. A long wait that could be a simple fix. Use both sides of the service stand. There is no reason to wait for food that is already prepared. Realy there is no excuse!
"CommonWealth Animal Hospital and Dr. Shebel specifically have been life savers for my pup! He had a very unusual stomach problem and fell very ill while we were out of town and I was a nervous wreck he wasn't going to make it! Dr. Shebel and the staff at commonwealth took AMAZING care of my little guy (so much so that it's his second favorite place to go on earth - 1st place, dog park) and he is luckily back on his feet. Dr. Shebel has been so accessible to answering my one million dog mommy questions and really cares about my little guy. Understanding the financial hardship of all that it took to get Morgy back to health, they definitely didn't try to kill us on costs like some of these reviews state. They've always been very fair price wise.  I couldn't ask for more in a vet or a vet's office!"
I was a big fan of Williamson Bikes at their E Wash store. The mechanics were gems who would bend over backwards for a customer. I biked over there tonight and it was closed!  Del gave no notice and I was told let everyone go on Monday the 8th of July. A 'closer' with his smirky smile met me at the door. I think he had to go to school to learn to smile like that. I am really bummed as it was 'my' shop and did I say the mechanics were great? Del was a conniver and I never trusted him after he tried to rip me off on a bike at his original bike shop.  Now I'll probably go back to Machinery Row who has good mechanics too.
"-What is there to say about this place...it's a brewery built inside of an old church. This place is HUGE! So much space and the bar itself is just massive.  Depending on the time of day, you may get a strong yeast smell which doesn't make everyone in your party happy.\n\n-I got the sampler of course, not much to say all the beers were good none stood out as AMAZING.  I actually preferred their pale ale over their IPA. But the sampler is worth trying.\n\n-The pizza is fantastic, I've been twice and both times enjoyed it very much.\n\n-All in all if you are in the area check this place out, it's got good food, good beer and just the scenery is fantastic"
"""I came here Thursday night with the \""""All-Star\"""" stand-up comics.\nIt's $2 for students with ID and $8 for anyone without. Normally I wouldn't have an issue with that, except they still demand a 2 drink minimum, which seems a little much to me.\nHowever, aside from the MC, the comedians consistently had us laughing (and sometimes face-palming) and the Pina Colada and Arnold Palmer I did order, were delicious.\nA good hour and a half. I recommend it."""
"I hate chains.  I want to hate this place so bad. HOWEVER.... Every time I come I have a GREAT experience.  The food is good.  The service is EXCELLENT, bordering on perfect.  The prices are very fair."
"This place is fast, charges less than the last place I went and the people are very nice. I had a jumping thing I had purchased but couldn't assemble myself--I asked any chance I could pay them to put it together for me--they did it , tossed it in the back of the car, and wouldn't let me pay anything for it beyond the regular price of the inspection."
"Although the little dude who checked me in wasn't well-versed in their Mac policies, he was very nice and tried his best to help me.  I would have been able to talk to their Mac technician directly, but he wasn't in at the moment.  When I asked to confirm a few things, another employee at the counter brought the owner out and he was very nice as well.  They are an authorized Mac dealer and repair center and if your Mac is under warranty there will be no cost to you.  \n\nTheir Mac repair guy called me the next day to clarify a few items the guy at the counter had taken down wrong.  The very next day after that, he called to let me know he was finished with the repair.\n\nI will definitely continue taking my Mac here, rather than the Apple Store at West Towne."
"This store reminds me of the numerous record stores in Philadelphia. The walls and floors are packed with all kinds of records.  It amazes me that they can even keep track of their inventory. I think that while this place deserves recognition, it also has a few overly priced records. \n\nIt's easy to kill a few hours here just trying out and listening to random records. You may find something you like! They range from having everything as strange as Japanese country music to modern alternative bands. \n\nThe selection of this store surpasses any record store that I've been to in the 'burgh so far."
"I had a problem with my new TV. I couldn't control the volume with the Cox remote, only with the new TV's remote, though everything else worked fine.  I called Cox and was connected with the tech person within one minute.  She worked on the problem and tried different fixes, but could not get it to work.  She didn't give up and was finally able to fix the problem.  I give her a lot of credit for resolving the problem in an effective and professional manner."
"""So, you don't have a clue what to get someone for their birthday?  Yeah, that's me...for every freaking birthday of a friend.

Even if you aren't looking for a gift, it is both interesting and hilarious to walk around!  \n\nOne night, I didn't pay attention to what time they closed.

"""While their merchandise is awesome, the staff is polite to a point which writing a review praising their awesomeness is warranted. The only qualms I have about Sunshine Daydream is their disclaimer about their pipes stating: \""""Pipes are for tobacco use only\"""". Really?

You cant beat the late  night half price! Get the wings! \nOne star taken out because all other food i tried is just ok....
"""Finally, REAL CROISSANTS!\n\nFor a long time I had given up finding authentic french, light & flaky, buttery delicious croissants in Charlotte supermarkets. They all offered up nothing but insults. Harris Teeter in particular should NOT be allowed to refer to that depressing roll of dough as a croissant. I feel the same about their \""""italian\"""" bread, but anyway.....\n\nSomeone who shared my pain directed me to Fresh Market. Once I found it, I realized why I'd never come across it before. It is terribly hidden from the road in a quiet little shopping area behind the woods and near some residential complex. The pastry section is spectacular! Behold, real FRENCH croissants!\n\nThey are delicious, and I venture there twice a month to buy them in boxes of 4 to put in the freezer for breakfasts. They even have real rugelach..traditionally prepared!\n\nTHANK YOU Fresh Market :)"""
"""I got the apple fritter the first day.  I don't have the words to explain how good that was.  The next day, I got the Boston creme and jelly filled donuts.  My wife said that I looked \""""possessed\"""" while eating those two in about 20 seconds.   She also was a bit annoyed because all I could say was \""""Ronald's\"""" and \""""donuts\"""" for the rest of the vacation.  They had other vegan options, but I couldn't eat more than two.  Otherwise, they would've thought that I was addicted (which I was)\n\nMy only complaint is that they closed at 4pm.  I was hoping to get there at night but kept forgetting that they closed so early.  Note to readers:  Get there early and stock up!"""
"I see other reviews on here and complaints about the back area and bathroom. This is a smaller business and if someone rides a bike to work and keeps it in the back to prevent theft that doesn't bother me. As gas as the bathroom being out of soap, it happens...... Just let someone know about it!\n\nFood is great, prices are fair."
Great service and wings BUT we had 2 tap beers and were charged $5 each even though every add I saw all over town said $4.00 beers. I know it is only $2. But it all adds up!
"I haven't been to Yummi Sushi for awhile. Last time I went was like at  least 7-8 years ago when my friend took over the place back then.\nMy husband wanted to have some good Japanese lunch but little more than just a ordinary sushi place.\nSo I thought of this place because it seemed like they have new owner and got great reviews.\nWe went there yeseterday for lunch.\nI was very satisfied with their menu and something that you cannot find at just neighbor sushi restaurant.\nI had live Octopus,Sashimi lunch special and some fresh sushi and sashimi they recommended.\nOh, and their fresh Tacoyaki is really really great!!!\nEverything was so fresh and great!\nIt might be little pricey if you get live fish but it is worth it!\nI love this place!"
"I was given a gift certificate to this place, so when I went in, I didn't know what I was looking for or what to expect. Driving into the Commercial Center, home of the Green Door, I was a little wary. However, they have some really nice things inside! The prices were good, and the salesman was helpful and friendly. I would definitely go back for jewelry repair or purchases."
"Previously lived right down the street and never made it in here because although there seemed to be cars filling up the lot, I never saw a lot of people waiting outside. Now I realize that's because there's hardly ever a wait here because the inside is huge, the service is effecient and the staff does a great job ensuring everyone is seated quickly. This place is right around the corner from an Egg Works. It's not even an issue, hands down this place is better. Traditional pancakes are fluffy, potato pancakes have this great chewy texture and their baked omelettes are larger than life and bursting with cheese. Breakfast is one of those meals where you can skip eating out to save a few bucks and eat a little bit healthier at home, but if I'm feeling lazy at home, this is definitely one of my first choices."
Best doughnuts in Vegas !! Just sucks that they only take cash!
"I don't know why, but I used to love this place so much that I'd make my boyfriend get this and hand deliver it to me at work. Is that ridiculous?\n\nIt has been a while since I've gone back, but from what I DO remember, the Jasmine Milk Tea was my favorite drink here. Hot or cold, you couldn't go wrong."
"Nothing fancy, but damn. Get me a footlong with kraut and I'm good to go. \n\nThis restaurant is not for the food snob, or for someone looking for any kind of dining atmosphere. The menu is a little sparse. Realest hot dog joint in town."
"""This was my second time eating at this restaurant. I stayed at the hotel for my first time in Vegas in September 2010 and didn't give the hotel or restaurant the best reviews. I just came here to grab a quick bite to eat on 1/7/12 and I thought there was some improvement. I actually came to eat at Mad Onion, but its been turned into a steakhouse. So Hooters it was. I ordered the \""""Lots Of Tots\"""" appetizer and the boneless chicken wings. The portions were large enough for me and my husband to share. With that plus a house Margarita my bill was only $22...so that was a plus. This girls are hotter than they were when we came the last time, but they were flat out ugly before so thats not saying much. Once again more guys were staring at me than the waitresses. And they notice which causes some major rudeness directed at me. So thats why they don't get 5 stars. If you're doing your job just to get attention, go be a stripper."""
"My PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I decided to finally use a Groupon we had purchased a while ago this past Saturday.  Normally, we would never really try an Italian restaurant (especially one at this price point) because quite frankly, it's very easy for me to cook a quality pasta dinner at home.  However, as I said we had a Groupon I didn't want to see go to waste. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was very laid back and relaxed yet professional, and the food was damn tasty (the house salad dressing is delicious) but I'm not entirely sure those things made up for the fact that in my opinion, it was way overpriced.  In the end it was spaghetti.  The PIC will definitely benefit from the pasta combination ideas I can apply at home."
"In IC we have Mesa Pizza, which I'm pretty sure must be a blow-by-blow ripoff of Ian's pizza.  Or maybe the other way around?  I'm guessing the former.\n\nMe and my labbie visited this place as a diversion from worm conference.  I have to say that this place has an excellent cheeseburger pizza, which I find to be a rare feat.  The half dollar pieces for change are kinda fun, but as I get further away from my visit I am increasingly pissed that they enjoy giving out such worthless change."
"After leaving another popular dinner establishment for a 2.5hr wait, we called Tyber Creek to get on the list as we were driving there. This was our first time to Tyber and we did not know that the main floor was mainly a bar area and upstairs was the dining room. They had a private party in the dining area that night, but reserved a table for us in the bar room. They could have easily told us no - first come first served! But they really went out of their way to make a great spot for us, and customer service like that deserves a positive review. The beer specials were great, and the food was really good too! I think we all ended up with fish and chips, but they were the best I have had in a while. An assortment of appetizers were also well done. Thanks for a great evening Tyber!"
"Chili Mint Chicken when you're in a hurry covers a multitude of sins, and a bad experience earlier in the week was forgotten as the spices made all bad thoughts disappear. However after I finished eating several of the tables around me were complaining about slow service so the incident I had earlier was not a fluke. Part of this problem is because their business volume is growing. They make good food especially compared to what LOS is cranking out across the parking lot. So they're having growing pains of sorts. \n\nI can't be too negative on a family owned business where the staff is busting their derrieres to keep up. Back to 4 Stars. Plus they are close by and when speed is what I need for lunch, they're on the shortlist of sit down places that usually gets me in, out, and on with my day."
The staff was really helpful and they helped me get a solution to my problem. The part that I needed was unavailable and they found another solution to solve the issue. \n\nThe time was pretty fast for the amount of work I had done on my car. The only thing that gives them 4 stars instead 5 stars is the amount of money I paid out for parts that are minimal in cost. I paid A Lot for labor when the work only took about 3 hours or less to complete. The parts dont even add up to half the cost of the bill.
"I've been here twice so far and love the pizza. However, the service is not as great. Both times they accidentally slid the pizza off the plate onto the bar, but I was too hungry and nice for them to make another. My friend and I also had to explain what the ingredients were to the drinks we wanted. The servers at the time were a mom and daughter so I just didn't want to be mean and snobby to them at the time. I told them they could use their phones to get an app with plenty of drink ingredients included, they were really nice about it. Maybe I will get take out next time."
"""I thought the food was yummy and the service was average. I will be going back for more! I also thought \""""melissa g's\"""" comment below was incredibly racist and unhelpful. Shame on her."""
"Plenty many fishies on sale. Wish the managers were a little more attentive to employees and customers needing assistance.  There are a couple employees who are downright rude, but I haven't seen them since the new manager started. He seems to be running a tighter ship.\n I stopped buying my wild birdfood here, too many moths. The rest of the produdts seem great,\n Store is clean, no smell, and the fish tanks are well tended, if sparsely decorated. \n I'm refilling two tanks, since I moved I haven't had time. Great sales here, makes it easier on the wallet."
Sesame Inn has 4 locations. Station Square is the worst of all. I generally avoid this one but love the other 3. Still much better than most Chinese around town.
"Usually travel United.  Much friendlier and cleaner plane.  Otherwise, an airline is an airline."
"""Parking is still on my \""""cons\"""" list but can usually park in the back or the garage for free. I still don't understand the need for the pay lots.\nUnion has been open for a few months now and I love it there. There is a coffee shop (Royal, it's wonderful) as well as some great locally owned shops like For the People, Bonafide Goods and Queen Creek Olive Mill.\nThere is a relatively new J. Crew, however it is a women's only store. \nSo I liked it before and absolutely love it now!"""
"""Found Deke's on this site. Called on Thursday, got an appointment for a possible condensation leak on Friday. They were busy in the morning and I called at the appointment promised cut-off time. They said they were running late. I needed the job done, so I said \""""ok\"""". They came on time for the up-dated time. Friendly, got right down to business, checked both my a/c / heat units. Tested levels, etc. Checked all the lines, and verified everything working ok. No leaks.\n\n Guess I have to call a roofer now to find out about water damage coming through. Price was as quoted via phone. Price was very reasonable for looking at and checking 2 units. Took less than 20 minutes. System set for summer a/c usage now.\n\n I can recommend Dekes."""
Coo spot to check out comics.. I was definitely on my big bang theory sh*t lol
"Too many people just walk by Himal Chuli. They don't know what they're missing. If you aren't familiar with Himalayan/Nepalese food, don't worry, just order something, it'll be delicious. The Himal Combination platter is a safe bet and a nice sampling of their dishes. The roti, takari, and dal is an amazing and healthy option too.\n\nThe waitstaff is friendly and so polite. Every time they leave me with a smile on my face. Never fake, never obtrusive, always helpful.\n\nGreat for vegetarians and omnivores alike.\n\nThey don't take plastic, but there's a free ATM across the street. If you forget and have to walk across the street to get cash first they don't mind, they're laid back like that."
"""These salons have a dozen or more stylists working on any one week, it's totally unfair to trash the salon  because of one stylist, especially since \""""the manager was very nice and accommodating  and professional\""""\n\nI'm an old fart with a lots of unruly hair, to boot I want scissor cuts not razor which makes their work harder.

"it was a 6 hour plane ride from SF. i arrived at charlotte at 6am west coast time. the car rental place denied me a rental because i was but a few weeks from 25. i called my brother and waited the 45 minutes while he rolled out of bed, put gas in his car and rolled on over (he lives in charlotte). during this time, i was stressed, crying and being told by the southern folks there that SF is where all the crazy people are...\n\nmy brother took me to the waffle house for breakfast...and it made it all better. \n\nHOW MANY WAYS CAN YOU HAVE YOUR HASH BROWNS?!?!?!?!?!?!\n\nsmothered with jalapenos, cheese, nacho cheese, gummy bears, marshmallows, brussel sprouts...maybe not, but it seems that way.\n\nif you are ever in the south, try the waffle house, any of them. they are  EVERYWHERE. we mustve eaten at one for almost every meal for a week..."
"This was one of two options given to me to get the shingles vaccination and I came here.  It was like a visit to DMV without the wait.  I was there for about 45 minutes.  \n\nThe process for vaccinations requires you to go down a hall, fill out some paperwork and get a number, and then go to the window when your number comes up.  The person at that window will look at your paperwork and notify you of what you need to pay.  Then, walk to the entrance, pay the cashier and return to the same window.  Then you have a seat and wait until one of the practitioners to call your name.  \n\nThe process is easy if you follow directions.  There was a bit of crying from some of the kids there for various reasons.  It was a good people watching place and Angry Birds helps with any wait time."
"I honestly can not comprehend how people are not completely happy with these pancakes. These are the best pancakes I have ever had. Blows IHOP, Dennys, and any diner that I've been to while living in NY, out of the water. I usually get chocolate chip pancakes, and pour some hot syrup on it. Delicious! Some times I get a (HUGE) omelet with Ham, Bacon, Chorizo, and American. Also Delicious!\n\nOnly reason they lose a star is I wasn't a fan of their eggs Benedict, and their short opening times.\n\nThis places need to be 24 hours for those late night meals, though! PLEASE!"
"My washer broke last night. I came in on a Sunday which was a little busier than normal but time flew and they have plenty of entertainment for the kids- video arcade games, a flat screen tv, and a theater room (who has that in a laundromat?!?) staff was friendly and I was in and out in no time. They also have a bathroom (you won't believe how many places don't) a change dispenser for quarters and a detergent machine for those that ran out or forgot to bring some. Big lots is in the same shopping complex though.\nThe only downfall is that the facility is a bit small. I would DEFINITELY come back if my washer broke again even though I live about 15mins away. TOTALY worth it for all the amenities!"
"What are the 5 Stars for: food, service, hospitality, originality?  Not all of these but 3 or 4 with a caveat: you don't go to an antiques shop for food, let alone vegan/vegetarian AND buffet (on Sundays).  Let's not forget the vegan bundt cakes either.  I give Zenith some slack for service in that patrons shouldn't go there with Michelin-service expectations but for Elaine and crew to stick out their necks in Pgh and do wonderful and very affordable vegan... I don't have a problem rounding up to 5 Stars.  Return visits are in the making!"
"Well I had recently left a 1star review as my vehicles and I were neglected and broke.  Since that review I was helped by Pete and Taz at the store and they seemed to have fixed the problem in no time.  I'm happy that they now have a responsible manager/s handling my account and the store.  That's who I will be going to every time now when I need help.  Thank you guys.  Also, the guys that work there at the counter and on the vehicles are great as well!!"
"""Is it just me, or does BB&B have the narrowest aisles in the world? Two shopping carts can't pass by each other - someone has to go around. This place is packed tight and from floor to high ceiling, it's a ton of stuff. Most of it, the sort of \""""Oh, that's clever!\"""" kinds of gadgets and gewgaws that you never really knew that you desperately needed until you came in here. I found that I needed a slide-out tray for under my kitchen sink and I needed a rolling tray for the coffee maker so that I could push it under the cabinets when it wasn't in use. I wouldn't have thought I needed it, but now that we have them, we can't live without them!\n\nAlso, towels and linens and bed stuff and more vacuums than you can shake a stick at. Holy crap, this place goes on and on and on!\n\nTip for you shoppers... please go counter-clockwise as you peruse the aisles. One person going clockwise gunks up the whole experience!\n\nReturns are a cinch if you have your receipt."""
"Alterations are not cheap, and as a petite person who always needs petite denim jeans hemmed, I wish that the K-12 system had not denied me the chance to learn sewing so I could DIY, or that I was actually in conformity with the Western conception of a 5 foot 4 inch petite female, but why dwell on what you can't change now ... \n\nI have had two pairs of pants altered here before, the main lady who works there did a nice job and they were on time. I believe I did price comparisons and at the time, which was two years ago, it was the most competitively priced."
"I was here to return a dress I ordered online.  I ordered a size too small... Tear. The dress was too tight... One to many pieces of pizza and I needed a size bigger! I went in to the topshop section and the girl at the counter, Lindsay, was awesome! She called around to other stores and found my size. They are shipping the larger (bummer) size straight to my house! Super easy and painless! Thanks Lindsay! I love Nordstrom!"
"There is a line outside the door every day at lunch time. When I walk in, I hear so much Arabic flying back and forth that I think I crept in to a back-alley shawerma stand in Jerusalem. Take these things as you will. \n\nI've brought a few people here who were very unimpressed, but that's just because they've spent significant portions of their lives in the Middle East. My obviously-homesick Arabic teachers love this place. You, on the other hand, are probably a white yuppie who can't tell the difference between koshary and mansaf. While the taste is not truly reminiscent of the Arab world, it is about as close as you're going to get in Madison.\n\nIn my honest opinion, the falafel is shit, and the chicken shawerma is nothing special. My 4 stars are for the lamb/beef shawerma, which is excellent. Get the lamb/beef shawerma, and only the lamb/beef shawerma.\n\nPortions are also uncharacteristically small for this kind of cuisine. Expect to spend a decent sum in order to get full.\n\nAlso, I'd eat here a hell of a lot more often if they actually accepted plastic."
"The food here was oddly more Chinese than Thai, even though the decor is very Thai. We came across this place during a family trip to Vegas. My cheap ass father didn't realize that Vegas buffets cost at least $35/person, and so we left the strip and headed toward the more desolate end of Las Vegas Blvd.\n\nI wasn't expecting much at all, but this place sure surprised me. I really liked their panang curry, and the service here was great.\n\nBest of all was the Thai tea. Most delicious Thai tea I've ever had. Really. Apparently the best Thai tea ever exists in Vegas. Who would've thought?"
"I am not really sure what the partially negative comments are about.  I mean, you may not LOVE the products-- but you have to understand that they are going to work like other products because they are plant based.  Anyway, I think the product is different from the store when it comes to yelp.  Personally, I love Aveda products.  I have unruly curly hair and they work great. But I am not a sole Aveda product user; however, I've tried about everything they have.\n\nAnyway! As far as the store goes, I think it's great. The staff is SUPER knowledgeable of the products.  In addition, they are extremely accommodating and hospitable-- not to mention the free services and samples available.  I also like that they are equipped for you to try all of their products from face cleansers to makeup.  \n\nLastly, Aveda has a really great rewards system.  I do think you have to pay for it- but if you are going to buy their products semi-regularly, the $10 membership fee is worth it.\n\nIf you are looking for products on the more natural side, this is a great store for you."
"I visited for restaurant week, so I can't criticize too much for the rather slow service. Though I would think that a limited menu would make it easier to serve.\n\nThe Texas Torpedo appetizer is pretty good, with nice, thick cut bacon. Good balance between spicy jalape\u00f1o, cool sour cream, smoky bacon, and melty cheese. \n\nThe adobo pork is absolutely delicious. Tender, full of flavor, and comforting. \n\nThe horchata milkshake is delicious. Spicy, like eggnog, and sweet. The best part is probably the fried tortilla strips covered with cinnamon sugar.\n\nLooking at the menu, I did think that their fare was a bit expensive. But I'll be happy to go back and try it again, not during restaurant week."
I confess that I was thrown-off by the one-star review by another reviewer.  I had a totally different experience and feel like it's only right to give this place the five stars it deserves.  I had excellent service.  My mom is close to passing and I had to get a suit altered on short notice.  The customer service was excellent in that they were very accommodating.  They did such a great job in such a short time.  What stood-out most is that the lady there asked about my mom when i picked-up the suit... so overwhelmingly thoughtful... Thank you
"More like the early days of Grand China when the food was good, instead of the disaster they became later on.\n\nWe've eaten in and had delivery now, and the only thing that wasn't great was the shrimp in my chow mein, I'll definitely order chicken in the future.\n\nNo worries about where to sit, they're not overcrowded ;)"
"The hotel was nice.  Only downside was the pull out couch/bed did not have any sheets and there were not extras in the room.  I know I could have called to ask for some, so that's on me.  We managed.  Otherwise, the hotel was clean, room was awesome.  The staff was amazing!  I just wanted to say Kiara Sanders went well out of her way to accommodate us while we were traveling.  There was  room mix-up and I left my sunglasses in the original room.  She personally took the time to get me back in the room to collect my glasses.  So I wanted to say thank you to her and the rest of the staff who helped us out there.  If you are traveling in Pittsburgh, I would definitely stay there again!"
"Although I find this place to be a little forgettable, it's partly because I've never had a bad experience there. A few friends of mine lived in the neighborhood for a while, so we would go there to start or finish our nights out, and sometimes we stuck around for the whole night.  \n\nThe crowd is a little older than some of the places more in the heart of town, which works well for me, as I'm turning into a grumpy granny when it comes to kids in bars. \n\nI have to agree with Brett M. It's a great bar. I don't know why. It just IS."
"I'm ashamed to admit every time I walk into Monterry's that ask me if I want a Margarita, they don't even ID me anymore. That either means I drink way too many margaritas or I'm a fan of Monterrey's. \nThe location isn't anything special. If you're coming from Harris Blvd. you will mostly likely miss the turn and will have to swing back around. As for Charlotte/ North Carolina chain restaurants, this Mexican joint is a personal fave. \nWhile the food isn't authentic Mexican it will satisfy your craving. \nTheir queso dip and margs are pretty tasty. The menu is quite extensive- usually I just grab a taco or burrito, but they have many other options.  \nThis location, has the best service. Everyone is always kind, attentive and speedy. I have been to other Monterrey's and this one is my favorite. They have good specials, outdoor seating and tasty Mexican... what's not to love?"
"Too highlights and lowlights\n\n1) cheap! Only $5 per person round trip\n2) great views from the top\n3) service wasn't very friendly\n\nA co-worker and I decided to take a trip on the incline while on a business trip in Pittsburgh. The incline is about a 3 minute drive from downtown so very convenient if you are staying in the area. You have to pay to park, but it's not super pricy - $2 for the first hour and $1 per hour after that. The incline round trip ride is $5 per person round trip and they only take cash!!\n\nThe service wasn't very friendly and the attendants seemed a little annoyed that the visitors (mostly tourists) didn't know what they were doing. However, the service is totally worth bearing through as the views from the top are incredible! There is plenty of room for photo ops outside, and some historical info about the incline in the entry building at the top.\n\nThere are a few restaurants nearby at the top as well. We had lunch up there and the views were stunning! Overall, definitely a bucket list item for anyone who lives in or is visiting the Pittsburgh area."
"""Well, any place that offers more than 10 different pancake offerings on their menu has a special place in my heart...err, or my belly, rather.\n\nI've been to this place four times, and I've tried different pancakes each time.  Only one, thus far, has disappointed me, although I think they may have brought us the wrong pancakes.  I have to say, I especially love the yeasty old buckwheat pancakes (which I'm still not entirely convinced you should put the words \""""yeasty\"""" and \""""old\"""" next to each other on a food menu) and the sourdough pancakes.  Their regular coffee is just ok (pretty standard diner-style), but they do offer french press coffee there (I've not tried it, but one of these days I will).  Their egg and side offers are pretty generous as well.  More food for a better price than IHOP or Waffle House, I think.\n\nThis is my favorite breakfast place...or anytime I want breakfast-for-lunch or for-dinner place!"""
"The food was cooked perfectly, but not seasoned to our older and wiser taste buds.  It wasn't seasoned too much just a little bit more than we would have wanted.\n\nThe muscles were cooked with more butter than we preferred, but 10 years ago I would have considered them rich and perfect.  The broccoli was seasoned with more salt than we preferred.  The vinaigrette dressing on our salad was sweeter than we preferred, but again 10 years ago it would have been perfect.  The lobster and fish were grilled and seasoned just right for us.\n\nThe service, lighting, and ambience was very nice for a romantic evening or night out with friends."
"Chuck is beyond amazing. There aren't enough words to describe how caring he is. I've seen how hard he works and cares for each one of his patients. Not too long ago I had something that presented as a pinched nerve in my right hand. My thumb, index finger and middle finger were numb, felt like they were on fire and slowly swelling. It was to the point where I couldn't even move my fingers, write or even put my clothes on. I remember it was the middle of the night and I went to the ER and what a waste of time! I immediately called Chuck the next morning and in a matter of four-five treatments I was able to see a tremendous difference. I was able to write, feel, and move my fingers. I highly recommend his practice to anyone."
"Tr\u00e8s bons bagels avec un choix de tout hallucinant (le type de pain , de garniture, de cr\u00e8me, de pickles, etc).  Un peu \u00e9loign\u00e9 de tout, pas de place pour manger assis, mais pour la qualit\u00e9 et la fra\u00eecheur, c'est vraiment tr\u00e8s bien."
"Maybe I go at a different time than a lot of the people writing reviews, but I've never had a problem parking here.  The stores in the lot across the street are usually closed by the time I get there, plus there is street parking on Thomas and Commonwealth and parking in front of the restaurant.\n\nFried pickles are easily the best in Charlotte and you'll probably not be able to finish the full order unless you have at least 3-4 people.  I'm not a big burger fan and would love if they added turkey or bison burgers to their menu.  Sweet potato fries are good but not the best I've ever had, while the hushpuppies could rival any I've had at BBQ places.\n\nOverall, good variety in their menu but they could have a couple more chicken entrees.  The lines are long, on the weekend nights especially, but well worth it.  Wait staff is awesome and attentive."
"Bad experiences at places like Ryan's kept me from trying Showmars. But I finally gave in because I found out they serve gyros.  And I hadn't had a gyro since leaving Chicago many moons ago.  \n\nTo my surprise Showmars' gyros are really good!  Not gourmet or authentic by any means.  Let's just say most Greek restaurants don't griddle their pitas in butter.  But it's cheap, fast, quality diner food. Definitely greasy and if you order too many sides or dessert they'll have to roll you out on a gurney.  But for what it is, I'm a fan.  The crowd is pretty hip too."
"I'm almost embarrassed to write this review because I really enjoy this place and the other reviewers do not seem to feel the same way.  Regardless however the man and I go to Benvenuto's quite often for lunch and dinner and we both love it. \n\nThe entrees are served with bread with olive oil and Parmesan cheese flakes that we love!  They also come with a soup or salad option as well.  We always sit at the bar and though the bartenders are never particularly rude they also are not overly friendly.  Despite that though I enjoy coming to this place and have many favorite dishes. \n\nThe man orders the baked spaghetti and meat balls; that's actually the only thing he orders because he loves it so much.  I'm not sure what my favorite dish is there but I've ordered pasta with a red creamy sauce with chicken and sausage that I love.  I have also ordered their pizza and have loved that also.  \n\nAll in all, I love this place and always look forward to going back."
"There are a few things that bum me out about Willaby's. \n1. They recently adjusted their hours and I won't be able to wander in there at 1am this Saturday. \n2. The wait seems like forever. It probably only took twenty minutes for our food to arrive this Saturday, but it felt like an eternity. \n3. I hate smelling like a hash brown. You leave and you smell like breakfast all day. \n\nI'm willing to look past these things because the food is mmm, mmm good. Butter. Lots of butter. And cheese, lots of cheese. I opted for something without much of either (eggs/toast/hash) and really dug my meal and didn't mind that it was under 7 bucks either! I hear when they're busy, plan to wait even longer for food, but it's totes worth the wait. The place is classic. Solid in every way. Though they can probs benefit from another cook because one person has a hard time plating a restaurant's worth of food. If you're a coffee drinker, they fill up pretty fun mugs with java. Get one! Snap a pic and post it like Tom Q!"
"I know people only tend to comment on bad experiences and not on good on here. So i'll give them a good review. I came here to get my gallbladder removed and stayed for about 4 days. All the nurses were nothing but nice to me, everyone who ran tests on me were also nice. the doctors that came in to tell me about my surgery were great and kept me calm, and apparently my surgeon was good since the surgery was successful. Only thing is they gave me about 3 unnecessary morphine shots which i think they did to run up my medical bill. And thats why i put 4 stars instead of 5. But at the end of the day i'm healthy again. Thanks Valley Hospital"
"I came here with the BF after a long afternoon of steady drinking and carbo loading. I was feeling pretty lousy and told him that I needed water and meat for dinner. He yelped and found Tornado and told me to order whatever I wanted on the menu. I got a Caesar Salad, NY Strip , and a side of asparagus. He got the New England Clam Chowder, rack of lamb, and a side of fries. The food was all amazing. Everything was cooked to perfection and came out exactly how we ordered them. We sat at the bar since the wait was about 45 minutes. We got excellent service and had a great time. I would definitely come back here if I ever find myself in Madison again. Mmmmmm steak!"
"If this place doesn't have it, you probably can't buy it...  Staff is always friendly, selection is overwhelming (especially for a fairly small space) and prices are reasonable.   This is really the only place I go when I need parts for my RV (other than WalMart for TP and tank chemicals...)"
"We called Stanley Steamers to clean our carpets after deciding to wait on having them replaced. Yes they were that bad! We have 2 dogs and 1 cat who had an infection that caused him to pee on the carpets. We were skeptical since the carpet was so old and stained, and they warned us when they saw the carpets that all the stains may not come up. It only took 30 minutes and all stains were removed! The smell was gone and we no longer want to rip the carpet up. We will next year but Stanley Steamer bought us some time! I wish we would have done it last year."
"Just got my leather boots repaired here. There was a rip in the leather on the toe, and he said that although he couldn't completely fix it, he could make it look much better. He originally told me it would take about a week, but called me 2 days later to tell me they were done! He managed to match the color perfectly, and you can only tell they were fixed if you look very closely. It was also very affordable - I only spent $14 on the repair!"
"This is the pizza place I go to the most if I want to sit down and have pizza, rather than ordering carry-out/delivery. If Luigi's (go ahead and make Nintendo jokes) was closer to me, I'd prefer to go there.\n\nThe pizza here is fine and it's got that ol' pizzeria taste to it. Nothin too fancy. I don't care for their particular sausage on mine and can't really figure out what it is that I don't like about it. The deep-dish is really good but too expensive...particulary for 1 slice. You would expect a monstrous slice for $6 ($30 for a whole pie!) but it's disappointing for the price you pay.\n\nComing after 5:00 pm is the real treat because you get complimentary garlic knots.\nThey also seem to employ a small army of cute waitresses (they must get really busy later on with the number of them) and sometimes the service will lag. We usually go before 6:00 pm and you would expect top-notch service most of the time, but usually this gaggle of girls will be too busy chit-chatting with each other and a drink refill can be a rarity at times.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
"Thank you Yelp for helping me find a place that was open for delivery on Sunday night.  I haven't dined here, yet, and I don't even think I've heard of it.  Wasn't in the mood for pizza so I ordered a greek salad and a meatball sub.  Greek salad was good, but was missing pepperocinis and red onions.  Meatball sub was above average.\n\nOh yeah, we got garlic knots due to all of the positive recommendations, and I'm glad we did.  They were awesome.\n\nDelivery dude forgot to bring a pen even though I ordered via credit card.  How does that always happen?  You know you're going to need me to sign it, dude.  Sigh, I still tipped him good anyways."
"I haven't eaten much Jamaican food. But jerk chicken, oxtail and fried plantains come to my mind right away along with colorful tropical drinks. When I first saw Jamerica's menu I was surprised to see curry and BBQ on it. After some looking into the cuisine. Jamaican cuisine includes a mixture of cooking techniques, flavors, spices and influences from the native people on the island of Jamaica, and the Spanish, British Africans, Indian and Chinese who have inhabited the island.\n\n    Mango Rundown was cabbage and carrots stewed in coconut milk with  yellow curry on a bed of beans and rice. The rice perfectly soaked up the sweet sauce. The jerk chicken and BBQ(not sweet kind) chicken were fall off the bone tender, A chill night out with Bob Marley of course playing in the background."
"I don't want to compare it to Chipotle, but I sorta have too. It is direct competition. They both are fighting over similar markets, so what makes Moe's different from Chipotle. I am not going to say which one is better because they both offer different experiences. \n\nMoe's has more have a selection of menu items (especially in the Vegetarian area). I love that. I tried the personal trainer salad, which is like a vegetarian taco salad. It was really good, minus the fact that I had to pay extra for guacamole :(\n\nThe environment was awesome. I love the fact that they don't play top 40 hits."
"This portion of East just makes me nervous. Whether it's the bad drivers, the improper use of the turn lanes, or the previous congestion while they were working on the road - even though it's really close to my home the thought of being able to find parking and enjoy a coffee seemed impossible. Luckily, this Caribou proved me wrong. \n\nFirst, unlike the Starbucks down the block, there actually is plenty of parking without fear of being towed. Inside I've never had an issue with table space or outlets, I love the multiple stations of sugar and creamers so you don't have to all crowd around the same area, and the service is pleasant. Can you occasionally encounter an employee who is suffering from a temporary caffeine imbalance? Yes, but unfortunately that's the nature of the beast. \n\nThe bathrooms are a little odd but clean, there's a nice patio, and Bruegger's next door is a plus."
We went with Chris at Buddy's plumbing after reading reviews to fix a clogged kitchen sink (the sink was filling up with water: strange).  Our problem was urgent and he was able to change his schedule to fit us in immediately. He was very pleasant and easy to talk to.  He explained in detail what the problem was and what he was doing. I felt absolutely comfortable watching what he was doing (normally I don't like watching) but Chris answered all my questions along the way. I'm curious how this stuff works so that maybe the next time I could do it myself. He used a hose that I had lying around the garage and took $20 off the final bill (nice surprise).
"I think I have had enough of all the Hooter-haters.  Seriously - if you want to be completely aroused during dinner, then go eat at a strip club.  The girls are not meant to be swimsuit models, otherwise they wouldn't be working at Hooters.  The point is, if you are going somewhere to drink beer and eat wings, you may as well have a girl with big hoo-hoos serving you.  She doesn't have to be a 10 for her to make it a more pleasant experience than getting beer and wings from some hurting girl somewhere else.\n\nSo get over it, stop with the criticisms and enjoy yourself.\n\nWings = good and cheap.\nHam & cheese sandwich - surprisingly edible.\nBeer - same as everywhere else.\nBoobs - well above average.  Plus the view of the pool patrons while you are eating is a plus.\n\nI knocked off one star because the bartender was way too full of herself and wouldn't even smile while serving drinks.  She might be a Hooter-hater too.  If you're too full of yourself to work there, get the hell out."
"location: inside an argentine deli/market\nmeal: dinner, it was empty so they easily seated all 15 of us or so...\nordered: parillada and empanadas\nrecommend: both! but the parillada meat was a bit overcooked (probably because the grill was still hot and it continued to cook even after it was served to us)...next time i'll ask for rare. the empanadas were tasty. next time, i'm going to order some to go!\ncons: they had a difficult time cutting individual checks for us. i think we waited over an hour to get our checks."
Not a fancy place but overall what you get for what you pay great deal great place... However not somewhere I am going to be on busy Friday or Saturday night Seems like a might get a little crazy
"""not sure what people mean by \""""it's dirty\"""" unless they're talking about the tops of the tables. when mildred's gets busy, there's only one guy behind the counter to make food, take orders, and clean up after the messy patrons.\n\ni usually get the weaver's fancy (red and green peppers, two kinds of cheese, mustard and mayo warmed up on a wheat pita) and gazpacho in the summer. their soups are homemade from scratch. \nthe sandwiches are huge, you might have to ask for some foil to take half home.\n\nnels is doing something right since they've been in that location forever. it's a bus-your-own joint, so take care of those messy tables before someone reviews the restaurant poorly because of it!"""
"""Yesterday I stopped at the closest UPS Store (store 5659 on Ann and Decatur) to me to send a small package to West Virginia. I asked the attendant to send it the cheapest way and explained the amount of time it took to get it delivered was not important.\nShe stated the ground delivery was $21.15 to West Virginia. I asked how much it was priority mail, she stated it would be $14.67.\nInstead of quoting me the lowest tariff, she quoted me the highest. I almost took the package to the US Mail, but agreed to pay the Priority Shipping.\n While paying, I noticed there a \""""Tip Box\"""" on the counter next to the register. The next time I have to ship a package, I will travel a few extra miles and visit my friends at the UPS Store on West Ann Road (store 2938) , where a \""""thank you\"""" is tip enough for them..."""
"God I'd give them a 5 if they weren't so ungodly expensive. I'm a student and 2+ dollars for a cup of coffee is just too high. Also why is an iced americano $.50 more than a hot one? $3.30? GAH! I really wish I could afford it but I can't.\n\nParadiso makes great stuff. Great Americanos, great lattes (even with latte art, woohoo! who knew it existed in Champaign-Urbana?), etc. Their environment is also great. It's absolutely what a coffee house should be, laid back and busting with culture.\n\nI don't know what else to say. They're great, but too expensive. I'm going to go broke if I pay for that everyday! I have to pay for rent and food and things!"
"It's a gas station, and a car wash.\n\nCame here for a quick car wash and to get some gas for my commute."
"Friendly and efficient. At 4:30pm they didn't have my specialized tire on hand, and even though it was too late to get it from the supplier they checked anyway. Next morning we were done in no time, and we could enjoy the rest of our visit to Madison before driving home. Top marks for service!"
"Oh this chicken was so finger licking good. It didn't taste like it was processed with chemicals like KFC does.  This place was hella buzy on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nMy only complaint is that I got a chicken burger which is actually just a chicken leg (with bones) put in 2 buns, so I had to pull out the meat."
"Oh, Ronald's Doughnuts, I love you. I never thought I would taste another decadent vanilla cream-filled, chocolate-frosted doughnut after going vegan until I found you. I am so sad that my trips from Utah to California, lately, have been through northern Nevada and not southern Nevada. I am really having withdrawals thinking about you. Next time I am getting 5 dozen doughnuts instead of 3. I am such a glutton."
"You know the type of place you walk into and you look around and go, oh my god I will never be like those people, but by the end of the night you are those people.  This is that kinda place.  My girls and I walked in for my bachlorette party and everyone's jaw dropped.  I thought my girlfriends were going to run home screaming when we walked in, but by the time we had 3 drinks we were screaming and laughing and just having an awesome time.  If you go to the OG you have to have an open mind to just enjoy what is going to happen."
"I have been taking my vehicles to Capitol Tire after a bad experience with another shop.  I have purchased tires, had oil changes, and other service and I have never been displeased.  If something isn't right, they will fix it immediately.  They even have a nice shuttle service so it's not a hassle to drop the car off for the day.  Great service!\nI wouldn't take my car anywhere else!"
"Closed on sundays. I came here a few times a few years back but didn't like it. It's a little dated inside- no frills, compared to Savers. But sometimes you can really find something for really cheap- lots of items are at fixed prices (skirts were $2.00). I found some good deals (found Kipling once) since rediscovering the store last year. I would go after visiting the credit union nearby. It's not very crowded. I agree with one reviewer on the boutique item prices being inflated. There is a sizable book section. Sometimes, there is a huge bin in front of the store in which one type of item (like backpacks) were dumped in that were priced at $1.00- but you have to dig (worth mentioning, but I didn't do that). The big housewares section has some beat up stuff but new things too. Sometimes the people working there are not in the best of moods. Worth checking out if you're in the area and it's not sunday."
"Amidst the over-priced sit down restaurants that prevail Myers Park and Eastover is a little slice of heaven in Providence Road Sundries.  Yeah, it's typical bar food but what do you expect: it's a bar!  Well, no that's not entirely fair.\n\nWhile PRS has a large bar, they actually serve good food.  Of the dozen or so times I've eaten there, I've never had to send back an order and have always returned.  \n\nTry the fried Okra...yum! It's a great place to meet as a group as there's lots of seating, tv's for watching the game, the food is good, and staff is always friendly.  They even have the old time video games (no Wii here...try space invaders) so bring your quarters.\n\nONE WORD OF WARNING: Parking SUCKS!  No seriously, this place is very popular so bring a small car and park in back.  Otherwise, plan to park at a church and take a stroll to the restaurant."
"The current star rating of 3.5 stars is incredibly accurate of Mineo's.  I'm going to be unpopular and round up to 4 stars because I think Mineo's is a more unique pizza than other places in Pittsburgh.  You're going to be indifferent or love it.  I'm confused about my emotions, clearly.\n\nDisclaimer:  I did not order a pie here, only two slices.\n\nMineo's crust is unique.  It's thin but not like cheap Pizza Hut burnt-to-a-crisp-thin pizza.  It's almost like the dough doesn't rise the whole way or something, but it worked for me.  The sauce was ok, not too special.  But I love cheese, and this pizza was swimming in cheese.  It was pretty fast for my two slices to come out, and at $1.70/slice, not terribly priced.\n\nI actually had really friendly service while I was there so I'm not sure about those complaints.  The tables were a little dirty and some weirdos were sitting inside.  Not pizza items were super slow, but it's not a huge kitchen.  I wasn't totally shocked by that.  I would come back here for a few slices on a laid-back night.\n\nCash Only"
Usually I leave a buffet with a major stomach ache.....Not this time. The food was good plus they had Kal-bi and crab legs. Service wasn't to friendly but that's usually the trend at an asian restaurant. I'd go back though.
I'll keep it simple: outstanding breads and croissants! \nI make a detour to stop by this bakery whenever in town and always end up with a loaf of bread and a few pastries to take home. I have no plan to stop that habit.
"Holy son of a cow...this place gets 5 stars. It was cold and windy today with a long line out the door- but what did John Mull do? They had a big ass bucket of free beers while you waited! We tried the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, mac-n-cheese, mac salad, beans and peach cobbler. I would have to say the brisket and mac salad were my favorite. The free beers while waiting is the 5 star maker :)"
"The kid had a great day at school, so it seemed an opportune time to hit Mary Colye's before it closes next month.  Being new(er) to Phoenix, we knew nothing of it until a few weeks ago.  So sad that they're closing, especially after our experience tonight!  The service was good, the ice cream to die for.  *sigh*  We'll have to stock up before their doors close!"
"I've never been here for breakfast, so I can't speak to the many negative comments about that. However, their lunch is fantastic! I've eaten there several times, and I've never been disappointed. My last meal there was basically a salade nicoise but with salmon rather than tuna. The haricots verts were snappy, the dressing was excellent, and the fish was perfectly cooked. Yes, the space is a little cramped, but this doesn't matter since the service is fast. If it's too crowded for you you can get in and get out quickly."
"So to be honest I dont really know a lot about comic books, but coming here I didn't feel like I was being judged on that. The owner was super friendly and very helpful. He seems to know a lot about basically anything you're interested in. Extremely friendly, and compared to the (one) other comic book store I've been in this one has an amazing selection."
The last honest brake shop in Vegas. Straight shooting with no fluff. No attempts to add unneeded parts and services. Fast service.  One time I decided to not make the drive across town so I tried a nearby shop. Big mistake.  I asked them to put my car back together and drove straight to mr brake. I saved $200 dollars. I will always recommend this brake shop.
"Pulled in and pumped gas into the rental car. Owner John noticed a very low rear tire and alerted me. Patched the hole ln the problematic tire in a couple of minutes at a super reasonable price and sent me on my way. Gas prices a little more than the Circle K across the street, but solid neighborly service instead of corporatism. Recommend"
I love shopping here. I've found the most wonderfully unusual things! The only drawback is the aisles are a bit tight and its hard to see the bottom rows. I always feel like I'm in someone's way.
"Somewhat lower priced birth control, with really long waits.  The centers are pretty much all the same here, just with different hours.  The staff is friiendly, but so slow you'd think they're actually MAKING your pills from scratch in the back.  But, they are more affordable than your regular doc if you don't have insurance."
"Some of the workers called my husband D.Wade as we were walking out... WTF? LOL They got jokes. Real nice peoples working there.\n\nMy husband hates Nike so we rarely step foot into any Nike stores, except if we're w/ other family members that would like to visit the store or purchasing a gift. Our last visit was w/ my Mother-in-law and I have to say, the selection at this store is pretty decent but, this is coming some an avid Adidas shopper, not Nike-- not by choice haha!\n\nThe store is pretty big and well maintained, for an outlet store."
"Really cool tour. This is a good way to see the city. My not knock is that there isn't nearly enough leg room. I am only a 6 footer and my legs were not even close to fitting, so I had to sit sideways."
"Great place to enjoy a nice conversation with a friend or two. Drinks and food are great! My only complaint is the set up of the space. It's just disorganized. I know that's part of the tropical feel, but I really wanted to move stuff around and make the place flow better. Anyways, worth visiting any time, but I would never try to go there with a large group."
"My wife is Filipina, but I'm not a huge fan of Filipino food. I usually only like the Filipino food she cooks. However, I have to say that I really liked my food from Fiesta Filipina. My wife got pancit with BBQ and I got a two item combo. She sent me off to get it. I think I was the only non-Filipino there. I didn't recognize all of the items, so I had to point at things and ask what they were. I decided on banana leaves in coconut milk and kind of like a pork stew. I also got us fresh melon juice and some garlic peanuts.  Everything was very good. I have been to many Filipino restaurants with my wife, and this is hands down my favorite. The prices are very reasonable too. My wife is glad that I have found a Filipino restaurant I actually want to go back to."
I just ate at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto for the first time this past weekend as part of a wedding party reheresal dinner.  Let me just mention that I hate seafood and seafood restaurants most of the time because I find them to be stinky!  This was place did not smell fishy at all!  The service was excellent!  I had the half chicken with rice and mixed veggies.  It was FANTASTIC!  Other people who did order fish raved about the crab cakes and the sword fish.  After dinner we sampled a few different types of desserts and I highly recommend the New York style cheesecake- it was the best cheese cake that I have ever had!  We were accomodated with a small private room for the rehersal dinner and had a fanstastic view of the city.  I will be back for sure!
"This beauty supply store has everything and then some, but with all beauty supply shops you have to have an idea of what you need to make yourself beautiful because no sales people come up and educate you on the vast products that they have. They take their clientele for granted."
"""This Trader Joe's is just as good as the one on Decatur but for some reason I haven't quite put my finger on yet, I like the Decatur location better. The vibe here seems urgent and rushed and the one on Decatur seems more laid back. Not due to the employees but more clientele. Maybe that's it. The folks over on Decatur don't mind much when my son is trying to see if he can relieve them of the unusual coins on the check out counters and sometimes they reach in and give him one. Not so at this location. They are not amused. \n\nI go to this location when I need to pick something up at Kmart so I can kill two birds with one stone. As a result I usually get there right before closing and while I know the employees hate that they don't get snippy. I usually apologize for my late arrival and get a \""""Don't worry about it, I'm here til 9 anyway\"""" type of response. \n\nSame good stuff, same good price."""
"I just moved the area and came across this one on yelp. I prefer a tanning bed as opposed to spray tan, which many salons are strictly spray only. I was taken back when I entered because the receptionist asked me what my tanning needs were and since I tan very easily, she recommended a great bed which was only a level 2. Normally these girls try to upsell beds just to make commission. I filled out a questionnaire about myself to determine what type of skin I had also. The bed was spacious and clean. I really liked the friendly and warm staff! I will return!"
"If you cant get down with fresh made Italian bread, hand cut meat, evoo, creamy mozzarella, and some spices then stay away from Calabria because that means more for me. \nOwned by a very sweet Italian couple this is a lowkey downtown lunch spot that has never disappointed me. They are by no means a full service grocery but do have sparse but unique grocery items that you wont find at your neighborhood Fry's.  I have mainly stuck with the Caprese sandwich in the past but sometimes i get crazy and add salami or prosciutto.  Can't vouch for the pasta other than that it is made on site, seriously though who needs pasta for lunch anyways, it is a deli, nuff said."
I was questioning going here because of the horrible review I saw. However a lot of my coworkers that go to this dentist office have never had one complain. Everything about this seemed perfect they are providers for my insurance and very close to my house. I decide one persons bad review can't determine all the good I've heard. So I gave them a shot. And I am glad I did. I called and made my appointment they were able to accommodate to my schedule and I had an appointment that same week. The two receptionist that greeted me when I arrived are the sweetest girl I've encountered. No wonder all my coworkers love them. I've gone for a few appointments and they have yet to be rude or moody like many others have been before. The whole staff is great even the doctor very patient and kind always smiling. I have to admit the dentist has always scared me. But not here I have not had a single problem. Definitely recommend this place!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT check them out.
"Came to Charlotte for the race , all the way from NJ. I saw some of the reviews and was nervous . Boy am I glad I did not listen to the negative posts. This was by far worth the trip .Ordered the fried pickels but not a great fan of them , Buffalo wings were great . I got the small block southern style which was also great ."
Rodney R is one of the best Tattoo Artist hands down. He is very careful with what he does and truly does show the passion in his work. Only reason I have gone to other places is because I usually just do a last minute session and it is hard to do that at one of the best and most popular tattoo facilities in the Carolinas. \n\nThe only thing that needs work on is the quick responsiveness to customer service.\n\nI sent my Dad to them to get some work done and no one helped him for 30 mins so he went to another place :(
New Seoul is my favorite Korean restaurant in Madison.  I've tried the others and they do not compare to the authenticity of this place.  The only complaint i have ever had is that some dishes are too spicy for me.
"I saw the Nevada Ballet's rendition of the Nutcracker at the Paris Hotel last week. The dancing was great and the sets were nice, but I've never been a fan of shows where the story is told solely through dance. Just give me a few words... can I buy a couple vowels please? Some singing -- whether or not from live performers or pre-recorded music -- would enhance any show. I know this show is a popular tradition around Xmas time for many, but it's not one that I want to partake in often. It is a well executed show, but just not my cup of tea. Still, it's a good show for what it is."
"This place is a drunk lesbian's dream bar. It is the most ghetto lesbian bar I HAVE EVER BEEN TO other than one in Louisville which I didn't actually get to go into. It is dark, musty, dirty and off a scary ass bridge in Polish Hill. If you are ever in Pittsburgh you must go here because it will fulfill your true yinzer postal working lesbian dreams. Downstairs is the leather bar, which I think I ventured to once, middle floor has pool tables and yet another upstairs with a re-finished dance floor and second bar to get down and dance. GO!"
"Love there cat fish.   It's frozen, so you have to cook it yourself.\nThey don't have time to cater to you here.  Order what you need.  That's it!  But I love the cat fish and the hot links!  So I'm not complaining!"
"Been looking for new rugs for my kitchen floor, and since I wanted something with a Little padding, it was hard finding something to fit my expectation. Then it hit me, try Anna's. At first, I walked the floor looking at the inventory and was surprised by the cost, it seems reasonable. For someone who likes to sew and often do sew my own curtains, I was impressed with the quality of the fabrics used. \n\nI found want I was looking for, and after reviewing the cost of new towels, will be back before year of year for new bathroom sets. This place is worth looking at for linens."
"The people who work here are very approachable. My friend was looking for incense but they didn't have any, all they had was scented candles but they were able to recommend my friend a place where he could find some, I'm sure the candles would have been nice. At least they were friendly."
"Who reads reviews for Med Cafe? Go here and eat their food. Seriously. Go here and eat their food. Now. Take it to the Memorial Union with a book. Or a friend. This is a real restaurant. The food is cheap and delicious. For every time I see someone in a chain restaurant with the same play school aesthetic, I think about how Med Cafe utterly kills it. Their food is so fucking good. If you hang out with someone that would prefer Einstein Bagels over Med Cafe, stop hanging out with that person. That person cheats in Monopoly. That person takes your beer without asking. That person would attempt to steal your girlfriend but can't because ladies aren't property. That person will take you to Olive Garden for your birthday. And that person will also be late and regift you a shitty used present.\n\nAnd it'll be your fault because you knew that person didn't like Med Cafe."
I won't go anywhere else for Chinese.
"""I've heard from a few people that they don't like Halo because the staff is \""""mean\"""" or \""""snobby.\"""" This may be the result of some unfortunate past choices as far as the receptionists go (which has been remedied - their current receptionists are awesome), but I think it's also because the staff at Halo is honest. Sometimes brutally honest. While other folks might be put off it by it, it's a good thing in my book. \n\nWhat I mean by \""""honest\"""" is that the piercers at Halo will actually take your anatomy and health into consideration before piercing you. Some people might get angry at being told they just are not anatomically suited for a navel piercing (for example), but I think that's a sign of a higher level of professionalism that a lot of piercing places haven't reached yet.\n\nOn top of that, they also have an amazing selection of jewelry, including cases full of antique and rare pieces that will make the cultural anthropologist in you drool."""
Fresh...not frozen meat... Same w shrimp..  They order for a day or two only... Fresh vegetables and sauces... No canned. Or frozen crap....
I've dined at this restaurant multiple times and I must say the food comes to the table in a timely manner and overall service is great except this dark cloud I noticed approaching my table. She goes by the name of Old Lady Susan.. Mannn my heart dropped when I come to realize she was my server once again.. My past experience about a month prior to this date.. She made mistakes on my tables order and just had an old lady grouch to her demeanor. I didn't ask to change sections for a new server. I believe in giving second chances but yet another awful experience.. I must say this place is great when Old Lady Susan isn't around to bring in the dark clouds.
The grocery store you grew up with.\n\nThis Giant Eagle is dated for sure.  That's not a bad thing.  I don't need a lot from a grocery store.  The store is clean and neat without any of the fru fru stuff becoming more and more common in larger grocery stores.  This is an EXCELLENT alternative to the other Murry Ave store that is so tight and crowded that you're lucky to get out alive.\n\nThis grocery store is just the right size.  If you forget something it's not like  crossing the mojave  to walk across the store to get it.
"American TV furniture division has stepped it up a notch.  No, about 10 notches.\nI used to be SO disappointed in furniture options in Madison until recently.  \n\nThey have some awesome new lines that look modern, hip, and actually in a decent price range.  I had to drag myself out of the store, or I would still be hanging out with all the cool stuff.\nI also have to give props to Heather R. who is a fantastic sales woman and knows her stuff.  \nNeed something hip for your digs?  Check it out!"
Late night happy hour menu. everything $1.50!?!?! Mind blown!
good. not the best pad thai but get the pan fried noodles.  CHEAP!
"Was in Pittsburgh for 2 nights and came here both nights for giant, cheap ice cream loaded with sprinkles for the kids. Didn't like the chocolate ice cream, but the vanilla and confetti cake were great. If I had been there another night, would have gone for the handrolled cones, which smelled great.\n\nWe were here in summer, so the lines were short and students scarce."
"Wait a minute, Wait a minute, Wait a minute.\n\nYou mean I can take a bus that's...\n\n#1)  On time\n\n#2) Has clean seats, aisles AND bathroom\n\n#3) Courteous Drivers who don't roll their eyes at the heaviness of your luggage (due to MAJOR shopping) ?\n\n...without the burn my l'il nose-hairs funk, loud talking and ghetto people of 'The Dog' bus company?\n\nMe-ow!  \n\n\n$27/OW*  or   $54/RT** from the Dutch Mill Park-N-Ride to Chicago's O'Hare airport.  Buy in person or online.  (if buying in person, as others said, exact change gets the Driver glowing)\n\nNot bad Coach USA.  Not bad at all...  Hope you're around another 50 years.\n\n*One Way\n**Round Trip"
"Visited Radiology/Imaging Dept. Although the procedure itself was painful for me (due to extensive spine hardware), the young bearded gentleman (didn't tell me his name) who registered me was polite, efficient, and took precautions to preserve my privacy when another client came in and stood (within listening range), behind me, instead of behind the marked line where she belonged. I appreciated that.\nThe wait for my imaging studies was brief. Then Laura, the radiology tech, came to the door & called me to come in. She gave clear & detailed instructions both prior to & following the studies. She was careful to protect my modesty, was professional, compassionate, and still efficient. She was kind and friendly. When you are in pain, these are things you really appreciate!\nThis is the place to go for your Radiology/Imaging Study needs! Thank you to Laura & staff!\nIn addition, they are open 7am-7pm!!! Awesome!"
"I had to go to Monroe Road Animal Medical Hospital on an emergency basis after my dog had an intense allergic reaction. I got in about 8pm on a Monday night and it was quiet. The staff was extremely accomodating and sweet; probably knowing that I was very stressed. After some time, I was taken to a room to be united with my pup. After getting the all clear, the vet took a good 20 minutes to chat with me, following a tech talking to me for another 10 minutes. I felt at home and I felt that the staff truly cares for the well-being of their fur-clients. The emergency price was very reasonable and I truly was so pleased with my experience, I will be transfering my pups care, regardless of the 30+ minute drive. I highly suggest for all circumstances, whether emergency care or general appointments."
"The coffee was delicious, served in a mug, NOT a paper cup, like one of the other reviewers complained. No city is a real city unless it has an independently owned low budget greasy spoon diner like this place. You can have your Perkins, your Denny's, your Pannekukin, Starbucks, McDonald's, or whatever chain you call it, but, for me, a breakfast at one of these diners is the real deal!"
"This pharmacy is always very busy but they have a lot of staff running hard to keep up with the demand. The store is clean and there is always someone to help you, unless you need to use the restroom.\nI find this at all of the box pharmacies though.\nI have used the minute clinic several times for minor issues and they have always been nice and helpful. The nurses will help you with over the counter remedies if you need them or shots and meds.\nThey are always well stocked with items for every day types of needs.\nI recommend this store over others in the area."
"Dear Burrito Bandito, I miss you terribly! I know, I took you for granted during all of those quick dinners before class. I'm sorry! Had I only known that your food surpasses the best that San Francisco has to offer I would have visited a few more times before leaving. Your carne asada tacos were so good, and so affordable. And the El Patron burrito, which could feed a family of 4, was outstanding. I hope to see you again someday!"
"Dear girl working at espresso,\nI am so sorry I barged into your store a half hour before you opened on a Saturday and practically demanded you make me a large vanilla latte so that I could make it through 11 hrs of volunteering. I'm not very good without caffeine before 10am, hence my inability to read a clock correctly. You were nicer than you should have been and your drink helped me get through two lectures on nuclear science with a room of 20 young boys.  Thank you so much."
Deeeelisshhhhh...what can I say about RHIS place. Makes me miss Hawaii. Definitely a place to come eat when visiting vegas
"Wow, haven't been here in a while, still same old small little shop, order at the window outside and either eat standing in the parking lot, (not so safe feeling), or eat in the car.  I love the Western with hot fudge, carmel and pecans., ooh so good. This reminds me of my childhood days, eating custard like this at home!  My parents always made a custard like home churned, with each kind taking their turn sitting on top of the machine as someone turned the handle.  Same old flavor, but without all the work."
Please switch out Queen size beds for kings.  The rooms can easily accommodate.
"""Had a BOGO free for Bob's that I used today. This place is sort of hidden in the corner of what definitely is zoned for office/commercial, so it's a little cryptic walking in and not seeing a receptionist. Bob is definitely from \""""back East\"""" as there are Mets' and Jets' stuff hanging on most of the walls. I was pleasantly surprised, I got the \""""Marino\"""" which is basically an \""""Italian,\"""" and I also got the tuna salad. I had portions of both of them and was really impressed. The meat on the \""""Marino\"""" was sliced right in front of me and nearly razor thin leaving no place for the great flavor to hide. The tuna was overwhelming - they do not skimp on tuna salad at Bob's! Both really good subs, right up there with Capriotti's in my opinion. My only real criticism is on their signage - it was really hard to read from the counter, but they offer a lot of menu choices so it's hard to fit it all in. I'll definitely be back."""
"""I remember when this mall used to be good. Now its just little New Jersey. Eat up with rude Yankees.\n\nNot quite great but still the only place you can go for more \""""upscale\"""" retailers. Dont waste your time at the Apple Store its ape shit in there. Cheesecake factory is very good."""
the only bad thing about this place is that it is cash only. which is sometimes a little inconvenient but other then that its probably one of the most reasonably priced places in chinatown. its way less then tea station about half the price. so for now this is my new favorite place. nothing i have tried is bad here.
"Although I have never bought anything here, and probably never will, it's a fun place to make laps around and take in all the odd, mysterious, sometimes tasteful, but mostly tacky items."
"I grew up sprinting across University Avenue every summer morning after swim team to stuff myself with Bagels. The delicious smells tortured us daily during practice. \n\nNow, Bagels is my measuring stick for all others. None have measured up to a warm Bagels' bagel right out of the oven."
"""The place isn't very nice, I would say it's a little \""""ghetto\"""" but in my opinion those places usually have the best food. Everything that I have tried here, I have liked. Everything is really cheap and the portions are large. I especially like the whole fish, try both fried and steamed. The place gets crowded and noisy so expect to eat with loud noise and a lot of commotion."""
"I don't think this is a 1 star place by any means. I've been here twice now. They have been consistent, which is all I need from a haircut.\n\nI haven't had to wait either time. The first was a true weekday morning, and the second was today, Memorial Day. They were actually open, which is nice. The first time, the lady (I think Valerie was her name) was patient enough to explain why they needed my name and phone # (it's for keeping track of when I go and who my hair is) and to work through my uncertainty with the size of the clipper attachments.\n\nThe haircuts each seemed to take no more than 10 minutes - surprising since I think it used to take longer at my last barber shop - and the ladies are nice enough not to try to chat with you much if you're quiet (I'm not a very chatty person).\n\nI will gladly continue to return, especially if they keep providing Valpak coupons online. I wanted to help the rating with 5 stars, but I'm keeping it at 4 stars since there's nothing mindblowingly awesome about it."
"Recently I ordered subs for my managers at work and myself. Being a vegetarian I make sure to request no mayo and always order their veggie sub. However, when I got my order the sub I got had mayo as well as a pile of meat. I called the store and spoke with general manager PETE NEWTON who was very apologetic about the mishap. Not only did he replace the sub with the correct one, but he also took care of my managers and I for lunch the following day. The outstanding customer service I received, the quick delivery, as well as, the incredibly delicious sandwiches will keep me ordering from their store in the future. I now keep their menus on hand all over the office and when I'm ordering several of the office staff typically order something also. Thank you PETE NEWTON for your generosity. It was much appreciated and you will always have a customer in me."
"""While I don't know how to brew beer, I know a thing or two about drinking it. ;-)\n\nIn all seriousness, however, I do have a few friends that are talented home brewers, and have been asked on a few occasions to swing-in and pick-up various items on their behalf. My most recent trip included a stop for bottle caps, rubber stoppers, and some one-step cleaner.\n\nThe staff is friendly, almost to a fault. I stood in line and listened to a lengthy (like 5+ minutes) conversation between the checkout guy and a customer; they were discussing hop differences as a small line of customers waited for their turn to check out (myself included in that line).\n\nIt took more than 20 minutes for me to get through the checkout line; I know because I plugged the meter for 30-minutes, and when I got to the car, it was flashing \""""0:00\"""". \n\nThat said, it still seems like a great store, and it's hard to fault employees for being friendly and interested in what their customers are doing."""
"After a long night of partying, I awoke with a hangover that was demanding to be fed with some good breakfast food. Since I don't know my area too well, I decided to see what Yelpers recommended for breakfast close to me. Omelet House popped up and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot. I called in an order of blueberry stuffed french toast, with 2 eggs, and 2 slices of bacon. It was ready when I got there to pick it up and all of the food was still piping hot when I got home. Everything that I ordered was delicious, it definitely helped the after effects of my indulgence in spirits from the night before. The best part about the entire meal was the pumpkin bread I warmed up later on for a snack. I usually make my own breakfast but any time I'm not feeling up to it (especially after a night of drinking), Omelet House will be my breakfast restaurant of choice."
"Birthdays, Anniversaries, Holidays.....this store always bails me out!  Why?  Because I workout at the gym next to it and I usually remember the day before the special occasion while I'm working out.....so, after a workout I'll go get the card....then I'm Mr. Hero for not forgetting....ha!\n\nThere's nothing special about this particular store, except it's location.\n\nWill I return?  As long as I'm married, hell ya!"
"I have had to take my sunglasses here three times. All three times they have managed to fix them, the last time I was expecting to be laughed out of the store when I deposited my mangled wreck on their counter.\n\nI have been charged $30 each time and see it as money well spent.\n\nThe shopping center may look a little grubby however rest assured the service here is anything but."
"okay, so i work nights and it's impossible to find food that isn't fast food at 3am. good thing i live in Vegas!\n\nafter driving the strip to no avail for some pizza. i finally stumble upon Cafe Verdi. it's located in a strip mall, and easy to miss. i know they deliver 24 hours but i live out of range so i have always gotten carryout. lemme tell you, they're pizza is YUMMY!\n\nfirst time i went i ordered a simple peperoni pizza, and my friend ordered the spinach. my pizza was great. right amount of cheese, right amount of sauce, sauce didn't taste nasty. my friend's pizza was extremely flavorful, and just all around good.\n\n2nd time coming i got hawaiin, and my friend got the BBQ chicken. hawaiin was good, duh, and my friend's was awesome once again! other than when the employees yell at each other in the back (pretty entertaining), and the lie about having fresh lemonade (it's country time), i will definitely be coming back for the remainder of my time in vegas :]"
"I found out about this place through the ASPCA. I recently adopted a dog and they were on the list for a free puppy exam. I am a teacher so naturally I am broke so the word free did it for me. The staff was really nice and told me to fill out first time paperwork. The vet was very knowledgeable and went through everything with me. I haven't had any bad experiences since but I did call one night around 9pm because my dog had gotten into something and I wanted to know if I should bring him in. The lady on the phone was very condescending and rude. My dog is like my child so I called in a panic. Instead of making me feel better, she made me feel worse. Ok so it was 9pm but they are open until 10. Other than this incident, they have been great."
My dealings with The Willick Law Group were spaced out over a year and was a very  stressful  experience for me due to the very nature of my case.  They were actually the 2nd law firm I had as the first one didn't do QDRO's but didn't refer me to them until after I'd obtained the judgment.  I don't think my case would have dragged on as long as it did had WLG been the original firm.  \n\nMy attorney was Trevor Creel who was very easy to talk with and quite knowledgeable  and I have no complaints whatsoever.  Faith was also wonderful to deal with.  Marshall Willick was present at the last hearing and after seeing him in action was happy he was there. \n \nMy only complaint during the whole ordeal is not with WLG but rather the Judge who I thought was out of line on several occasions and kept dragging the case on and on. \n  \nI would not think twice about using them again and highly recommend them.
"Dry rub ribs were awesome. Great smoke, tender, but not too tender where all the meat falls off the bone when you take a bite... Sides are kind of mediocre and an afterthought."
Sure this place is trashy/trailer park ... but it's fun. and I can't believe no one has had the balls to talk about the private rooms. There are small rooms with curtains where you can go with the strippers for a private show. This is the best part of this bar. I did a private with a Russian stripper. Best lap dance I ever had.
"Always friendly service, but parking can be a zoo, and getting to a gas pump is like playing a slow speed game of chicken more often than not. The store like all Terribles locations sorely needs an update and a deep cleaning (or a bulldozer to wipe it out and start over). For all it's flaws I still stop in here a lot so I can't complain too much. 4 Stars...because service with a smile covers a multitude of sins. (This review is for the gas station side, I've never stepped foot into the McDonalds it shares space with.)"
"Really happy I stopped in here, was in a hurry and STARVING. I amtrying to eat clean and thats insanely hard around here with all the declious food. I got a veggie wrap here and had them add some grilled chicko, totally scrumptious. Def try out this lil spot."
"Maybe my problem is that I'm always comparing Vegas institutions to my hometown favorites--maybe if I stopped doing that, I'd be a little more satisfied with life. As it is, eating at Luv-It, I can't help but feel a little ripped off that it doesn't compare to other frozen custard places I've eaten at. The prices are a little higher, the custard has a little less flavor, the neighborhood is a lot less family-friendly--last time I was there a guy came up to my car asking for money to buy his suicidal friend a beer--but examined in its own right, Luv-It is still pretty great. The custard is creamy and good, and the experience itself is worth it. Luv-It's may not be the best frozen custard, but it's good, and it's all we've got!"
"I hate going to ihop but my sister is a big fan so we always go if she can convince me to leave the house. We're always treated well and if there were problems, it would get fixed right away.\n\nThe other day, our waitress was named Dalilah. She served us several times before and was always nice and refilled our drinks without us having to call out to someone."
"So... I didn't stay here. I wedding reception-ed here.\n\n('Twas not my wedding reception.)\n\nAlright, so...\n\nAn A+ banquet staff. Professional, courteous, and on point, on the real. \nA lovely, accommodating space.\nAnd the bathrooms were super-nice, too. Bonus!\n\nThe Concourse managed two wedding receptions in one night no problem. Kudos to having a GM and staff that can hang.\n\nWere I staying in Madison I'd certainly entertain the notion of staying at this hotel. Quatro!"
"Yes, the Miracle Mile Deli at Park Central in Phoenix closed several years ago, but Park Central Deli is still at the same location and offers the same great food and quisine.  They closed our Miracle Deli at Arrowhead Mall in the West Valley too,  so now we have to go to the East Valley to get true Miracle Mile food, a long trip, but worth the drive. Josh is at the Scottsdale store, and even though I harrass him a bit on my blogs, he's still friendly and accomadating when we see him in Scottsdale. Hopefully someday, Miracle Mile will again grace our taste buds in the West Valley, it's a great place to eat, and the employees are very friendly. My favorite meal is Brisquett on a Kaiser Roll, FF, pickle, cold slaw and a drink."
"Most complaints here seem centered on lack of outlets and uncomfy chairs or bad chai lattes.  Oh well.  The coffee here is great.  It IS a coffee place.  Hand tamped espresso (my usual choice) is the best I've tried in the city.  \n\nCash only.  Free WiFi.  Most baked goods made on site and very good.  Outdoor patio is great.  Clean restrooms.  If you want good coffee, this is the place.  If you want a couch and an outlet, there are two Starbucks within walking distance."
"I'm not one of those sunglasses junkies and as a matter of fact I've been wearing the same Costa Del Mar Polarized lenses since 2003, but when the recent blistering Phoenix heat finally ruined what was a long and happy relationship I found myself looking for something new and The Vault definitely filled a need with great sale items, friendly customer service, and a nearly overwhelming selection.\n\nHaving not owned a pair of Oakleys since high school...1998 for those keeping score (yes, I'm old)...I'm impressed by how the quality of the product has changed over the years while prices remain similar and the styles continue to evolve."
"This place is consistently good. I love the fish with chili sauce. I was craving the steamed dumplings but I have a shellfish allergy and you can't get them with pork alone here.  They mix the pork and shrimp so I had to pass (disappointing). Also, found out they do have drunken noodles but in the menu it's called lemongrass noodles."
"Good food for a great price.  The only thing that wasn't good was the pasta, which was mushy."
"They were awesome from the moment I walked in the door until I walked out.  My laptop was broken some how and the battery wouldn't go in, the tech helped me immediately fixed it explained how to avoid it happening again and all for no charge :) Not to mention it all took less than 10 minutes!"
"""Ahh. One of the stops on my Journey to Nowhere. \n\nDrugstores that are not of the Walgreens or CVS variety have become a rare breed. The neighborhood is indeed kind of dingy and scary, it all adds to the character of the place of course. And really, with so much Psuedo-Gentrification going on in the Naked City and Downtown, crime isn't all that common around those parts anymore. Besides, there's ALWAYS loads of people around. \nI would have tried the venerable Diner in here since I have never eaten in a greasy spoon before, but I've heard a few too many scary stories about the place. Maybe I will try it on a day where I'm not on a \""""journey\"""" of some sort. \nFortunately, I doubt this place is in any danger of closing soon. It's VERY popular, and that is indeed a good thing. It is common to find certain products in packaging from the 70s/80s, but don't worry, all of the stuff is just fine. CHEAP too.\nAnother plus are the vintage Vegas pieces adorning the walls, which gives the place a very organic, neighborhood feel rather than corporate, carbon copy like CVS."""
"* I didn't stay at the hotel *\nBeen to Vegas three times and back to this casino 2/3 of the visits. I like the tables here because they aren't directly on the strip so they don't seem to up the minimum drastically, it's just a little tough to get a seat sometimes. \nIf ya can't get a seat then go grab some wings!"
"""My bf and I ate here yesterday. When we got there we were not acknowledged right away,  there was no line to be seated and we were probably waiting for about 5-7 min and finally they noticed us and sat us down. The place was lacking a bit AC. When we did order our food, it was served promptly though, they were also on top of my bf coffee. I had my mouth set for some steak and eggs, but unfortunately they did not have that on their menu, which is kind of rare. They are know for there yummy huge omelets....six egg omelets, enough actually for two people! I ended up ordering the \""""popeye omelet\"""" but with sausage instead of bacon. It was really good, but it had a bit too much cheese on top. Their banana bread was delicious, I really recommend it. Overall it was a pretty good place to eat at and we would eat there again."""
"Small specialty boutique that as the name states sells socks.  They also have a limited selection hosiery.  Prices are a bit high average cost for a pair of socks is around $10  They have plain solid colored socks, striped socks, knee high socks, and socks with have print, pattern, and design imaginable.  I picked up a pair of socks with French Bulldogs on them for myself, and a pair with cats on them as a gift.  I do miss the days when they had a wider selection of hose, tights, and stockings."
"HATE  Nothing.\n\nDISLIKE  Selection of frames and contact lenses not as extensive as the other Spring Mountain location.\n\nLIKE  The friendly and helpful staff. Location in Chinatown. Open on Saturdays.\n\nLOVE  The optometrist Dr. Chu was efficient, knowledgeable, and makes you feel at ease."
"This place saved the day recently when we needed really, really big trash bags. None of the big boxes had them big enough (Home Depot, Lowes, etc.) and the event was hours away. \n\nWith a Hail Mary phone call, Maintenancemart saved the day! Not only did they have bags the size we needed, the guy encouraged me to bring in one of my receptacles to test it right there in the store, rather than take any chances. Fortunately, the bag fit. After ringing me up, he even carried the box out to my car for me! The customer service was top notch!\n\nOther cool things:\nthey have pretty much every cleaning supply you could imagine -- including those super-cool vacuum cleaners you wear like a jet-pack!\nthere is an enormous plant growing into the rafters -- they'll let you take a snippet if you want to test your green thumb at home.\n\nHelpful tip: the parking lot is NOT the first one you see when traveling south on 7th Ave. turn into the drive right after that...  :)"
"Second time I go to those guys. Great service, friendly and always looking for a solution to your problem. This time my battery had died. I didn't even have a receipt but they still trade it without any cost.\n\nBoth Nick and the manager John were super friendly and helped me out right away.\n\nGreat guys! I wouldn't go anywhere else as I definitively trust them!"
"I almost don't want to write this review because I want to keep it a secret. This place is a hidden gem in south Charlotte. You cannot go wrong with anything you order but a few of the must try items are the blackened meatloaf, chicken cordon blue and gumbo. They have a great portion sizes. Unless you go really early or really late you will have to wait for a table but it is work the wait."
In the cookie cutter world of big box stores we live in it is refreshing to get an experience where the entire store was committed to an exceptional customer service standard. At most hardware stores it seems like employees try to avoid you so they don't have to answer your stupid novice questions. I believe I counted 11 different employees at this Home Depot that actually asked if they could help me and my wife find something. The best part was the paint department where the nice gentleman explained us the differences between the brands of paints and help us select the correct finish for our room. I am so sad I don't recall his name because he was excellent. We live about 20 mins from this Home Depot but will continue to make the trip past many other hardware stores including other Home Depots to go back. Great work to the team that worked the store August 10th around 6pm.
"Had a wonderful experience this past Saturday (1/26/13) after noticing one of my dog's poor little eye was swollen almost closed. Called the hospital (my vet was closed already for the weekend) and was able to be seen within the hour. Waited about 15 minutes for the tech to get vitals on my dog, did wait a little longer than that after being seen to a room- but that was to be expected as this was an emergency and we are not regular patients here. Will definitely consider them again in the future if another emergency takes place and we are unable to be seen by our regular vet. \n\nPrice was also a lot lower than expected- I've had experiences in the past with emergency clinics that were way overpriced, this was a nice retreat from that. Thank you Monroe Rd Animal Hospital!"
"Came here after i asked audio express about installing a car stereo in my lexus.\n\nTheir installers at audio express said they would charge me 150$ on top of the overpriced head unit to wire it in to my lexus, because it is a complicated car with in line amplifiers.........AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NO WAY TO MAKE MY FACTORY SUBWOOFER WORK.\n\nWent to BEST BUY and 60$ and 20 min later everything worked beautifully, same head unit, half price.\n\nAsk for patrick at best buy on rainbow!"
I blew out my Fox rear shock.  Took it to Sport for warranty repair.  Bad news: 3 weeks minimum to get it back from Fox.  Yikes!  Dan & Brian found me a shock to use in the mean time.  Wow!  These guys pulled a shock out of thin air.  They know how to take care of their customers.  Thanks guys!
"Dear Chad B. First of all, if you want to use Yelp learn how to use it. None of these bartenders you mentioned work at the Buffalo location. Second, I have lived in Nevada for 27 years and the 2 bartenders you mentioned are two of the best bartenders I have ever had. Your yelp review is false and all locals should ignore it for both the Buffalo location and the girls he mentioned location."
"First off, WOW! \n\nMy friends and I were in Vegas for vacation and, in search of breakfast one morning, managed to spot this on the road. 4 girls and 1 guy completely starving so we ordered a dozen donuts...$7, what?! Do you know what $7 gets you on the east coast? Possibly 2 donuts and a medium coffee. These donuts were fresh and my goodness were they delicious! My favorite was the lemon filled. Not too sweet but still had the tartness of lemons, yum. It would usually be jelly but I didn't really like the jelly they used which would probably be why this wasn't 5 stars. If we had these on the east coast, I would definitely be a regular, possibly even ask them to adopt me...why not?"
"i've had decidedly mixed experiences at courier.  my first time included being too loud and being rudely, but passive aggressively kicked out.  its a complication situation to get into, but i believe my good friend t.j. explains it all in his first review.  in any case, courier is a good place to go if you want to feel like your in a neighborhood place that is so established that sometimes the service might suck. and sometimes the food might suck. even the coffee might suck.  to couriers credit, when the food and drink doesnt suck its delicious.  but they have KILLER thick lovely milkshakes, and absolutely delicious chorizo topped potato skins always.  everything else is a hit or miss, but doesn't that just make the dining experience so much more fun? \n\nok, i might be stretching it a little but i do love courier because i think at this point, i could not live without a little chocolate malt goodness in my life every once in a while.  what can i say? i'm hooked."
"So the only downside of having an amazing first course is that the rest of the meal didn't quite match up, though on their own the entree and dessert were both also delicious. A warm melted local cheese topped with arugula, pear and smoked cashews was...creamy, crunchy, tangy, freshly crisp, wow!\n\nEntree was three perfectly cooked diver scallops on bed of garlicky kale and black lentils with smoked ham bits, topped with a sweetly acidic mix of apple celeriac. This dish could have used more of the celeriac and a bit more crunch somewhere...maybe crisped bits of pork belly instead of the ham that was soft and relatively mild/lost in the mix.\n\nDessert was solid, a chocolate pave with soaked cherries, frozen custard, cherry glaze. French press coffee was very good. They have a great selection of cocktails, beers, and top notch liquor-- casa noble tequila, excellent scotches, mythe absinthe, others.\n\nService was truly impeccable, attentive without being stuffy or overbearing. I think that if I go again I will get 2 first and 2 second courses and skip the entree, so I can try more flavors."
"alignment job needed then take it to arrow. My car neeeded an aligmnet since I lowered my car and place a set of bigger rims. Joe the owner took my car in even if I was scheduled incorrectly, he then  explained everything, and completed the job under a hour. aligement is what they specialized in and there the masters at it. Joe was great guy as well, and professional. I could feel the difference after the aligmnet. will be do business again."
"Generally really good food, although not everyone likes their particular style of breakfast potato (pan-fried with rosemary).  love their coffee.  Only complaints are that it's rather cramped and gets INSANELY crowded on Saturdays, and it's closed on Sundays!  I don't get that.  On weekdays, though, it's generally a nice spot for brunch/lunch, not too crowded."
"i had no idea this place existed until my sister and brother-in-law told me about it. it's hidden really well beneath the kennedy manor apartments, but is worth the effort to find it. \n\nwe came for cocktails before my boyfriend and i went out to dinner for his birthday, so maybe it was because it was early, but there wasn't anyone else in there. it feels like a speakeasy in there, like al capone could be having a drink by the windows. there are black and white photographs around the room, and the wood is dark. \n\nobviously, service was great because we were one of maybe two parties there. the drinks were delicious. it feels like a little hideaway. this might be madison's best kept secret."
"""When's the last time you flipped a quarter with a man behind a counter to see if your food might be free?  We did.  I paid, my buddy ate free (alcohol not included).  Brats and cheese curds, of course.\n\nGee - I miss college.  Picture sort of a Barnaby's times 10 in size with an upstairs \""""theater\"""" with a super giant TV and THE GAME ON!  Add pitchers of beer everywhere....along with wrappers of burgers, empty plastic baskets, cheese curds (great!).\n\nDownstairs a cafeteria-style counter to order food by the number...rows and rows of wooden tables and benches to eat and drink on......college cheering and booing at the Badgers....tons of W-sweater girls and guys.  Beer spilled on every table.  No problem, the beer prices change with the hour and are cheap at any time.\n\nPacked, but roomy somehow.  Cutsy quotes on posters on all the pillars.  Remember college yet????"""
"I used to go to Red Herring at least once/twice a week during my undergrad years.\n\nIn my opinion, the best lunch option near campus, and never as packed as some of the shittier places nearby.  Soup and sandwiches were always great, and the entrees were good too.  I could never convince my friends to come with me, because they were idiots.\n\nThe food definitely fluctuated in terms of taste/quality depending on who was working that day. I still remember a specific dish I had back in '05 that still ranks among the top 10 things I have ever eaten. Unfortunately, by comparison, nothing else from there ever lived up to that one dish, even though it was always excellent."
"This review is about the food, not about the place and not about the service. First of all, if you order from them, PLEASE make sure to try their Chicken Alfredo pizza as well as Chicken Cordon Bleu pizza. I have constantly ordered pizza from them for the past 3 years, and I ordered nothing but those two. It never disappoint me, it's so yummyyy. I could never find pizza at any other place that is even close to how Glass Nickel has it :(\n\nOh, and their chicken wings are pretty good too."
"Yum,  yum, yummy fried chicken and hush puppies! Tried to eat here before, but, long story, didn't. Worth the wait. It's a landmark for some folks in Davidson. Now I know why. Chicken a little too salty and slaw...well, I had one bite and had to throw it away."
"After a full day of fighting crowds and traffic, who really wants to cook? Not me. We ordered a pizza online. Papa John's had it delivered in 32 minutes, still hot and still fresh. Good flavor, good coverage of toppings. I'd order from this location again.\n\nTip: Check the specials before you pick your pizza. It's possible that you can get a deal for the same price or less."
"""First off I have to admit that my rating is pretty biased because I have somewhat of a sentimental attachment to this hotel. I stayed here for a year and a half (gasp!) for business during a project in Pittsburgh. It's not a glamorous hotel, but it has what you need for a comfortable stay.\n\nStandard Hampton amenities: complimentary breakfast, coffee & tea available 24 hrs in the lobby, free wireless internet, hotel shuttle, etc.\n\nSpecial extras: free passes to a full local gym just up the block, a small \""""business\"""" office with access to a phone, a computer, and a printer, the location is very convenient, and the staff (namely the hotel managers) who work there are just plain great people.\n\nI gave 4 stars and not 5 because it is still a Hampton Inn, and I wouldn't give less because they put a lot into good service.\n\nIf you need to stay there, ask for Jeff (the General Manager) and tell him that Angela sent you. :)"""
"""I agree with the below review about the demeanor of the two different ladies who work there. I also feel like I am bothering the owner when I come in and it makes me feel uncomfortable and awkward. \n\nBut, I try to ignore it. They are one of the few places (if only) in town that does a special \""""tricky hem\"""" on jeans and they do great work."""
"I love they're food, but the two guys behind the counter never smile even when you speak to them.  They look like and act like they work for the Mafia.  The wait staff also seem to be tense, which is understandable working for those guys.  If you want great, fresh Italian food, you'll love it, just don't expect great customer service."
"Good grief I love this place.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I wish I lived in Madison.  It is also one of the reasons I'd weigh a hundred more pounds if I actually did.  So warm, so cheesy, so tasty, so meaty, so wonderfully not good for you that it should be a requirement to have one at least once a week to maintain your sanity.\n\nAside from the food, the shop itself isn't much to look at.  A tiny place at the intersection of a dead-end and State street doesn't exactly allow for much else other than takeout, but who cares when you're getting food this good.\n\nBack to the food.  Meat.  Potatoes.  Cheese.  Sauce.  Veggies.  Crust.  All of these are the reasons I bring a cooler with me when I go to Madison, because I NEED to bring a couple dozen back with me."
"This Location is clutch, and flavor is excellent, in terms of diveyness. Plus really bad karaoke which caused my brother-in-law John  to get 86'd. I believe we each had two Buds and a shot of Jaeger in a short amount of time. Franklly, I believe John was surly and combative since our prior stop was the Atomic Liquor on Fremont street, which is like the holy Frickin Grail of Divebars. It was like Dive Bar PTSD. Guaranteed good time at Dino's."
"Okay-tacos are delicious and the staff are super friendly...I didn't care for the ambience since it was a bit loud to carry on any conversation and one ladies bathroom for a packed place is ridiculous.....\n\nFrankly, the tacos are the BEST so it doesn't matter if there are no available bathroom, loud music, long wait.. It is worth it :-)"
"Colburn was the second water heater repair service\n\n\nwe called . We had no hot water. The first one we called was Highly recommended on Yelp . They advised us without a comprehensive inspection that we should   replace the water heater. The cost  was. $2,200 .We were suspicious of this being the best solution. We then called Colburn a family  \nowned company. The tech John came the same day. He did a thorough diagnosis and found the problem.  He installed the part the next day as promised. The cost $127 including part  vs $2,200. The damaged part only cost $45. I highly recommend Colburn."
"Being from San Diego I have always had a love for Tea Station, especially since it is a branch of Ten Ren, which is actually my favorite boba from San Francisco. (Ironically Ten Ren is one of the worst tea brands once you go back to Taiwan, but we're in the states here so come on now). \n\nI was hungover as shit and we needed to kill time so that traffic would die down so we decided to drop by. I got me an almond milk tea without boba and the only thing I look for when I get almond milk tea is that they don't have that powdery consistency. Too many places mess up almond milk tea. Not this place. It wasn't too sweet and it didn't taste like powder. Not very high standards to make a review but hey, I'm reviewing tea.\n\nOnly bad thing is that Tea Station usually runs more expensive than your typical boba joint so be prepared."
"Asada Burrito, add cheese. Legit! Sometimes my burrito is hotter than others so you might want to ask for no salsa, and grab your own from the salsa bar."
"2 words: Toasted Ravioli. End of review. Just kidding.\nSo this is a Buffalo NYers' spot. If you need a place to watch the Bills and what-not, here you go. For everyone else (myself included), I come here for a good ole pub/bar experience. Nothing fancy. Solid bar food. Doesn't totally break your bank. \nService... well, most likely I have had a few too many to drink by the time I leave here, so my memory is a little cloudy. From what I can remember, service is not the best, but it's acceptable. \nThe only thing is, parking in this area is a major pain. Be careful, you don't want it to be towed."
"We frequent the Draft House and the food is always excellent and they have very friendly bartenders. This past weekend we went for dinner and we were disappointed in the way we were treated by the manager, Patty, in the dining barn section of the establishment. She was quite rude and made my husband and I feel very unwelcome (we asked if they could please leave the TV on the same channel it was on when we were seated - pure silliness, especially since no one else was seated any where near us and we were only watching a sporting event.). I give the food 5 stars, the waitress 5 stars, the manager 2 stars."
Last week I was desperate need of new windshield wipers when it was raining. I live close by and stopped in to get a pair. I had no idea which kind I need or how to put them on. The guy helped me figured out what I needed and got them on for me! The price was reasonable and the service was awesome.
Why the heck would you go to IHOP when you could come HERE??!?!?  I've only been here late at night and it gives this creepy/killer Bob from Twin Peaks is at the other table kinda vibe but I don't give a damn.  The food is great for an excellent price.  I don't think you can compare the quality of pancakes between here and IHOP.  There is no contest.
"I've rented from here a few times now and it's always gone off without issue.  I usually book a compact, because it's just me on business for a couple days, and seems like every time I rent a compact I get upgraded because they run out of compacts- ok!  This last time I ended up with an SUV!\n\nThe cars are always clean, usually pretty new (SUV only had 7000 miles) and I've never had an issue with getting in and out.  I signed up for the Gold membership this last time, it's free!, so it was especially easy to skip the line and go straight for my car.  \n\nMy company gets an incredible discount with Hertz, and with service/cars this good, I have no reason to stop using them for the foreseeable future."
"Oh Mike & Tony's, how do I love you! The saddest part of moving out of Southside was the fact that I would no longer be able to walk a block to indulge in the deliciousness that is Mike & Tony s. If I was forced to eat something for every day the rest of my life, it would be the gyro special with extra onions. There is just something about a gyro from here that makes me so happy.\n\nService is always quick and really friendly. Gyros are hot and fresh and always taste amazing! I love their fries too, always goes good with a side of ranch. If you get it to go, they send you off with your gyro in a plain brown paper bag, just like a typical school lunch. Only this is way better than any school lunch i've ever had. \n\nBasically, you need to try Mike & Tony's. I sincerely miss being able to go there whenever I craved a yummy gyro, and I tell anyone and everyone to check them out!"
"""I sang this morning....(after Dr. Singh performed LASIK on me) \n\nI can see clearly now...the glasses are gone\nI can see all obstacles in my way\nGone are the pitiable looks that had me sad\nIt turned into a bright (bright), bright (bright)\nSun-Shiny day. \n\nI have never been able to see.  So when I opted for lasik surgery to rid me of my coke bottle glasses, I did some serious research.  I \""""interviewed\"""" many doctors but it was Dr. Singh's confidence and personality that won me over.  He was confident of his abilities.  \n\nOne a lighter note, besides being a doctor that cares about the well-being of your eyes, he is also quite an expert at putting the drops into my eyes..... It usually takes more than 10 tries for me (yes, i'm that scared of those things), but Dr Singh did it the first time. \n\nIf you love your eyes, this is the man who will help you take care of them. I can definitely see why he gets 5 stars in every review...he comes  \""""Eye\""""ly recommend!"""
"Beer four to five stars, but no food?  Their food used to be so good too!  It's nice to get away from the strip, but makes for an expensive cab ride when you enjoy a few of their great craft beers.  I'll give them four stars, but could easily downgrade to three for no food."
"What ever happened to no-nonsense barber shops?  \nThanks to a little Yelp from my friends, I found this spot for a quick haircut on my way to work.\n\nSimple old-school spot.  Nothing fancy.  Just a few old guys giving straight up hair cuts for a reasonable price.\n\nWhat I liked the most is that they still break out a little hot shaving cream and the straight razor to clean up the neck and edges.  Then a little hot towel, and off you go!\n\nGotta love preservation of the art!"
"This gem is located in a squat brick structure on a grim stretch of North Tryon, not where you would expect to find a good restaurant, but then again, isn't that so often the case?  Better than any road sign is the wafting scent of hickory hanging over the road as you approach.  I believe I could find this place blindfolded.\n\nIn compliance with the federal regulations regarding BBQ joint decor, this place looks as if the crates holding all the old props from Bonanza! blew up in the middle of the room and everything lodged in the walls.\n\nService is super-prompt and friendly, you can sit and watch the pitmaster doing his thing in the corner, and what can I say?  It's just really good and tasty.  It's not going to blow your mind, but this is a good place.\n\nIt makes you wonder why people pay a premium to eat at places like Mac's Speed Shop (they're good too, but at twice the price).\n\nAnyway, carry on."
"I popped in here on a whim to get my Marilyn redone. This place has been here forever, and needs a coat of paint. Luckily I don't judge a piercer on the exterior. \n\nThe guy at the counter was nice and had me fill out the release and a few minutes later I was a happy camper with a new Marilyn. \n\nEverything was disinfected, gloves used, listerine swished, and a nice tip left for my piercer. (I'm terrible with names) \n\nA good place for those already comfortable with getting a piercing. \n\nThanks guys!"
"I was staying at the Doubletree next to the South Park Mall with no feeding options other than typical suburban chains....a wasteland as far as I was concerned. I decided to wander through the neighborhoods looking for something a little more local and a little less factoryized.\n\nI found it here.\n\nThe best I can say is The Roasting Company exceeded all my expectations. I like that they specialize in one thing (chicken) and they do it well. My 1/4 dark was moist and flavorful and the two sides were well worth trying.\n\nI always try to sample New To Me dishes so I tried the Squash Casserole and Smoked Cheese Salad. I was happy with both. The casserole was helped out by the slight addition of hot sauce (Lisorno?) and the salad was just fine the way it was.\n\nFor southern-style grub this is a good as I've had and would definitely come back again.\n\nOh, by the way, my entire lunch including drink was under $10. A very good value."
Solid shoe repair business without anything fancy. Good for a resole on those boots you love. Shoe repair seems to be a lost art in these parts and many parts for that matter. Guess people buy cheap shoes and toss em when their done? A good pair of shoes fits like a glove (of the foot) so why not fix them? Anyway I am glad that this place is around.
"Eh...This place isn't too bad. I wasn't expecting much when I decided to go; the place looks a bit run-down like it's been around since the old western days or something. However, I was a bit surprised. The place was fairly clean and quite spacious on the inside. They had nice looking pool tables, a dart board, and plenty of misc. entertainment. The crowd looked a little rough and it's clear that the regulars run the place. They ALWAYS has some type of special going on and usually different day by day according to something they had hanging up around the place. The bar is really smokey with really dim lighting on the inside. It's dive-bar'esk. The place is pretty cool though. There aren't a lot of options out here in this area so there is a good chance I may be back. But overall, it's just another bar. \n\nAlso, the bartenders were super friendly and appear they have been working at the bar for quite some time."
"There's not much to say about your typical gas station but this one is fine. It's always packed and the prices are never the lowest in town (heck, you can find cheaper gas less than half a mile down the street) but it's on a busy corner, has 2 Redbox machines, sells fresh Krispy Kreme donuts and is attached to a McDonald's with a drive-thru. The station sells Chevron gas and they will take your Vons shopper's card for a gas discount -- you can save up to 20 cents off per gallon."
"Kathy is absolutely fantastic.  I have a complicated tax problem and instead of leaving crying she made me feel much much better.  Didn't have to sit there and watch her prepare the tax return, everything will be ready in a day and a half.  Made what I anticipated to be very stressful situation actually relatively stress-free.  Well worth anything she wanted to charge me. Still very competitively priced. Absolutely will recommend everyone I know to see her.   Thank you a Thousand times!!!!!"
"The one on state street closed.  I was very disappointed.  If you like peanut sauces or pad thai, the Thai Peanut Lo Mien, add chicken, is awesome. I eat this all the time.  I have tried my friends lemon chicken which was also very good."
"""Okay, I'll admit...I wasn't overly excited about stopping in here for breakfast. The limited menu didn't grab me, but the boyfriend wanted to try it out. \n\nOkay, so occasionally I guess he can win, because this was top notch.\n\nI had the baker's breakfast, which consisted of fried eggs, baguette, dressed greens, ham, and creamy butter. Yep, basically the five food groups of deliciousness. EVERYTHING on the plate was perfect. The green salad was light, and the shaved fennel was a welcome addition. The eggs were SO tasty. Best fried eggs I've had in Madison. I'm not usually a \""""ham\"""" person...but this isn't your grandma's Sunday dinner ham. This is house smoked tastiness. The baguette, of course, was just what a baguette should be. Crunchy outside, moist and chewy on the inside(topped off with some of that butter!). \n\nMy boyfriend had the french toast...and I believe he said \""""This could very well be the best french toast I've EVER had\"""". \n\nWe also got a loaf of the Country Hearth bread, which we've been devouring with lunches this week! \n\nAbove all, the staff was super nice, in that way that I can only find in the WIlly St. area.\n\nGO HERE."""
Stop here one morning when I was in a hurry and picked up some scones and crescents.  The almond crescent makes my mouth water jus thinking about it but the scones were just ok.
"Sometimes you walk out of an intense yoga class feeling all great and think wow, I want to go eat something bad now. That was my Tuesday. And this was my naughty transgression. \n\nI love this place. It doesn't matter how awful of a day you may be having... you walk into Mr. K's and immediately feel happy. This place has been family owned and operated for more than 45 years. All of the warm fuzzies. \n\nMy go to order: chili dogs. Make sure to have them throw the dog on the grill. Love the chili and it's always the right amount.\n\nMilkshakes: Jebus. Fantastic. \n\nFries: I'm not the biggest fry person. Yeah, I know. I'm weird. However, this is a place where I will order them occasionally. Translation: yes, they are pretty tasty. \n\nThe special this week: Sloppy Joe's. Pretty good... but it was no chili dog. \n\nThe parking lot can be a little challenging sometimes. Take a deep breath and embrace your patience. South Blvd can be a nightmare sometimes. Taking a left out of the parking lot can be impossible. I usually don't even attempt it unless it's a really off time of the day."
"""The parking situation here sucks; if you can't find anything on the street (you won't) you'll have to park in the garage across the street.  Good luck with that if you don't own a Vespa or a Smart car.  \n\nThe interior is always crowded and you'll be lucky to find a table during the lunch rush.\n\nThat said, I don't care because the Traffic Jam sandwich is to DIE for.  Meat overload w/ delicious hot peppers - so, so good!   Yeah, the crusty bread may \""""Cap'n Crunch\"""" the top of your mouth a little bit but it's totally worth it. \n\nThey had another location in North Phoenix closer to my house and sadly, it seems to have closed.  I may or may not have shed an actual tear."""
Why did you close ! Where did you go ! \nAmazing food simply amazing
"I recently had to make a cross country trip with my college daughter to St. Louis from Las Vegas.  Of course my car was going to have to stay with her there so she could get around while she was working.  Before our road trip, I wanted to be sure the car was 100% ready for the trip AS WELL AS safe for her to have while she was there.  I  took the car down to LV Wheel Alignment & Brake Service.  Don't let the business name fool you.  They do a lot more on vehicles than just wheels & brakes.  I asked Dale to give the car a full checkup from brakes to oil change.  Pricing was VERY good for all the work that was done and I am TRULY convinced that I got over 30 miles to the gallon on that trip because of the work that Dale & his crew did on my car.\nThanks for making my trip safe and not have any worries about the condition of the car that I was leaving with her."
"So I just moved up here from Charleston, SC and most places that do this good of a job, I've spent $80+ on. I went all out here and got the Manager's Special which was $29.40. \nI drove up and the guy asked me what I wanted and I told him everything (I haven't gotten my car cleaned at all since I bought it, including moving, animals, boyfriends, snow, etc so it DEF needed a lot of work.) and he went and looked and told me he didn't think I needed to splurge on the carpet shampoo unless if I really wanted it because he thought the vacuum would clean it as thoroughly as needed. He also said I should pass on the windshield rain protectant (sp?) since my car was new. I mean who does that? I very much appreciated his honesty.\nAnd it's so nice to have it done quickly and not to have to try to entertain myself for an hour!"
"Just released after 2 nights in with blood clots in leg and lung. Echo other comments re attitude of staff, both in ER and 4th staff. Consistently friendly, caring, attentive and patient. They took great care of me and kept me informed of what was going on and why."
"Needed a gift card, the place was swamped on Xmax eve, and the gift card person was on break, and no one else in the store could operate the gift card machine.  Why?  Probably for security reasons, but just my luck, we land there rite as its the persons break time. So, we were gonna just leave and I was going to let you all know that on Xmas eve, Ulta only has 1 person operating the gift card machine.  And when that person is on break, and you want a $100 gift card, you will have to wait.  Unless you run into Charles.  We told him our situation.  He has the charisma and the cool to make things happen and we were on our way in 3 minutes.  I'd like to apologize for interrupting the persons break, and I'd like to thank Charles for his help.  We will be back!!!"
"Amazingly cheap prices for quality parts. Would give five stars but the only complaint is that it is hard to get a hold of them sometimes when you call about a price on a part. Lines can be long during middle of the day but best times to go are right when they open in the morning. Excellent customer service otherwise, will always be first choice when I need auto parts!"
"I must start this out and say this was my first visit to The Penguin and I've been in Charlotte for 3 years...insert shock moment. The shock was the same reaction I got from the owner who I sat next to last night at the bar. Brian went through the menu with me, told me what's popular and what to order my next time in too. He even bought be my PBR for my first visit, which was appreciated. He even made sure 15 minutes later wen he left to say good bye and give me a menu to take home with me...great service, especially from an owner! \n\nHad the Small Block Burger all the way with bacon and pepperjack cheese (recommended by Brian). It was big, juicy and full of flavor. For the side I tried the small order of fiend pickles which were a HUGE portion and were awesome! \n\nThank you for a long overdue welcome Penguin. I will be a frequent visitor and encourage everyone else to experience the same!"
"My relative and I had a 13 hour layover with US AIRWAYS and wanted to sleep at a nearby hotel for a few hours. After reading the reviews about hotels near this airport I was very hesitant. But surprisingly the hotel was quite pleasant. We did a full inspection of the room because of the reviews I read. The room was great , clean , decent sized and extremely comfortable. The only thing I could say negative was the smell of hallways , it smelled like smoke. Other than that  The staff was very friendly and helpful , gave us food menus for a late dinner and was prompt on picking us up for the shuttle for our early flight. Overall a very pleasant stay and I would suggest you stay here if you need something near this airport."
"I just received a gift of a large quantity of Wedgers from family who recently visited Madison.  The overall taste of the pasties has not changed significantly, with the exception of the crust being a little thinner on the top and without the nifty dough swirl down the middle.\n\nThe thing which surprised me was how much smaller the Wedgers had become!  The cheese pasties are about two-thirds the size of what they were the last time I was there and the steak/potato ones were miniscule in comparison to their predecessors of yore.  As I understand it, the prices hadn't changed to keep up with the shrinking pasties.  I sadly remove a star from my previous rating due to them not being nearly as much of a deal as they used to be."
"""Food and service were top notch.   First thing I thought when I got seated was that the movie \""""Casino\"""" if not filmed there,  had sets modeled after this place. It was clean, but very retro. My biggest complaint?  I ordered the petit filet with bernaise sauce, and was asked house or Caesar salad. Not add, just choose.... I ordered the Caesar, and it was very good, but I would only eat small amount so as not to ruin my meal. Guess what?  It was an a la carte item I would not have ordered..it was an additional. '$12.  I felt misled. Do I mind spending good money for good food?  Not at all...but I would not have not have spent $12 on something I knew I would not eat very much off."""
"Place - smaller store than the ones I am used to. So sometimes I feel I am missing out some good items at other stores, that are not readily available here. \n\nPrice - most of the times, I am able to find a good deal! My most prized possession and good buy was this green/gold/brown mosaic mirror! \n\nStaff - courteous and always welcoming!\n\nLeave it to Pier 1 to have lots of mosaic tile tables, frames, plates, and etc!\n\nWhen I shop here, I do have a reason (sometimes none at all).\n\n- look for my seasonal sprays of flowers for my hanging wall vase - for diff seasons :D Perfect place to get them, since they are sometimes cheaper, and a lot prettier than Michaels.\n\n- their vast selection of Christmas ornaments!!\n\n- some greenery for above the kitchen cabinets\n\n- beautiful glass infused with metallic paint plates!\n\n- .. And whatever I find deemed worthy!"
"Decent coffee, good tea. The staff is nice and that's the most important thing, really. My only complaint is that sometimes,the wifi doesn't work, even if you have the login."
"As one of the other reviewers said, this place is huge and just keeps getting bigger. I have been an overnight patient there twice, both for just one night. Both times I was admitted through the ER and, yes, the process did take a while, but it's a big city hospital, so that's what you would expect. I thought the level of attention and care was good. The people there are sympathetic and seem to care about what they are doing, and making sure that you are comfortable. There was one area where I thought they really stood out: I lost my job last year, and had trying for months to get my family into one of the local sliding scale clinics so that we could afford doctor visits and meds, only to be told that none of them were accepting new patients. The social worker at CMC took the matter into her hands, made a couple of calls, and got us in, which was a huge relief. Overall, I found that for such a big and busy hospital, the people there know and care about what they are doing."

"""My major problem with the dentist is not the poking and prodding, but the fact that they don't ever bother to tell you what they are doing and why.

No inscrutable \""""hmms\"""" or secretive scribbling in a chart. Just friendly, open discussion. The cons?

"I wouldn't go to Avenue for a Friday Fish Fry since the wait is always ridiculous, but Avenue's fish fry take out is clutch. Call in and their yummy cod and hash browns (the fries are only ok) are ready in about 30 minutes."
"Hey for a local DIVE this is the place.  Karaoke, pool, and you do not even need to bring your marlboro's cause it is so smoky you just need to inhale - I was there for a couple hours I think I smoked about 4 packs.  I almost lost my 36 year old friend to couple of 60 year old women smokin cigars at the bar.  Hey corn beef and cabbage on St. Paddys day.  The girls sure are purdy tho!  - and actually the people sure were hospitable."
"Nice enough staff and more importantly a perfect location to where I was staying. Tried to call for a pickup but they were busy so I just walked. Had to wait 5-10 minutes for my car to be ready, and a coffee or a water while I waited would have been nice. Some other Enterprises offer this. But hardly anything to take major points away."
"""I'd rate this a five for the views, but feel like they could do more with this; part of this is this is more than just a tourist attraction but a functioning transit service. The parking is inconvenient at the bottom station; down by the river and kind of meh. You have to climb up stairs to an overpass over the road, then down some steps to the waiting area, which is very cramped. There's really no organization to the setup there. You have to pay exact change into a bus-like fare box; the attendant does not provide change; there are change machines but you'll get a lot of dollar coins. It's two fares; one up and one down. The top station has nice displays on the history, and a small gift shop, as well as a scenic lookout with incredible views of downtown Pittsburgh and the \""""Three Rivers\"""". No attendant at the top; you pay all fares at the bottom."""
"I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed! Over on the west side of town, south of Red Rock by 4 miles in just another non-descript strip mall you'll find Vic's Barber Shop. Sure there's no pole or Playboy's, but you'll find the best damn hot-towel shave that this 40-something's ever had. \n\nIn an age of high-styled salons with over-priced egotistical designers, it's good to know you'll always have a great neighborhood barber in Vic's where motorcycle magazines and the FX channel rules the day. Where the staff would rather talk about good times (old and new), sports, mobile stripper poles and betting lines. Is this family friendly? Absolutely. We kept the adult conversations to a low volume as there were fathers with sons in for appointments. \n\nA $17 trim and a $27 straight razor shave. It's the best $44 + tip I've spent in a shop. Period."
"VEGAN donuts?! WHAT?! I find it funny that this place doesn't advertise it or even mention it anywhere in the shop. How did people even find out about it? It's a pretty sweet deal, but it makes me wonder why other donut places can't just make their donuts vegan too, for chrissake?! They're yeast donuts that are vegan, but taste like regular freakin' donuts.\n\nWhen you ask them which are vegan, they point out the top two rows in their case. The only rows on the bottom are actually just cake donuts. Not bothered though. Those are pretty easy to make at home.\n\nI'm from LA - why don't we have a place like this that?! Not fair!"
"We came into urgent care around 7PM and there was no wait what so ever.. I'm not sure if it's like this in the morning or afternoon. We were greeted right away by the receptionist. She had short hair and she was so helpful and friendly. Usually when I take my niece to her pediatrician, waiting already takes around 2 hours. We were in and out of urgent care by 30 minutes. Doctor and nurses were oh so friendly."
"Dinner for Lunch today:  Chips, Salsa, Sweet Plantains with Cheese (what Plantains with cheese, where have I been).  I have never left this continent, though I have had Plantains in Louisiana in a Haitian Dish and many South American Restaurants and a few Spanish Restaurants and I have never had Plantains with cheese.  Before I scraped the cheese off I snapped a photo and tasted one, ummmm, OK I'll leave the cheese on!\n\nSteak with Chimichurri Sauce and Garlic Sauce, Sausage, Potatoes, Peppers, Spinach and Rice.  I'm not a big fan of any of this food, though all of it was better than Three yelp stars and the service was perfect.  I would eat here again, ONLY because there are too many places I like better, I'll stick with the places I like more!"
like the location.    \nalways clean. \nFriendly Staff.\nNothing like UMC!!!!\nThe nurses.. well it depends some are sooo nice and amazing the other seem so impatient and in a rush. \nI feel like they need to be reminded sometimes they are helping humans.. ill at times ones..
"My initial response was umm....no we are not eating there.  But of course I was pleasantly surprised by this place...don't get it confused with the Yummy Sushi in Henderson (horrendous)...because the sushi is worlds apart.  The sashimi was very fresh, the only item that tasted fishy was the clam, but I think that's probably an acquired taste.  The rolls were made well and presented nicely.  They also have a happy hour time too, for those looking for a late night eat.  Also no AYCE for those looking to consume a massive quantity of sushi."
"This is the gigantic shopping mecca you expect when you think about large US shopping malls. They have all the big department stores and a range of stores from Urban Outfitters, to Lululemon, up to the higher end like Coach and Kate Spade.\n\nThe mall is absolutely huge and on a Saturday afternoon was packed with shoppers. I didn't even get all the way around the mall before I had to get out of there because of all the people. It also seemed extra busy as there was some sort of a fashion show going on.\n\nWith the vast store selection and the other offerings like restaurants this is probably a mall you want to check out to get all your shopping done in one place."
"I was less than thrilled with their Chicken Shawarma, but that may be because I've had EXCELLENT Chicken Shawarma in Chicago.  However, their Tomato and Cucumber Salad was delicious and refreshing.  I also got their hummus trio, and those were delicious as well.  The flat bread was warm and soft."
"Used these guys twice to rent a Uhaul for moving purposes. Had good experiences both times, however this past time I felt bullied to buy the insurance for the truck when I only drove it 2 miles. I ordered the truck online, and everything was ready and good-to-go the morning of. I would at least recommend using these guys for Uhaul rentals (though I can't speak for storage rentals)."
"I was a little hesitant on taking the tour. I thought it looked a little corny.\nBut actually one of the highlights of our trip. We learned a lot about the city. It was a nice chance to sit back and relax, hear about the city and have someone else drive. Our tour guides were very friendly, they talked about things we were passing and entertained us the whole time. They stopped every once in a while and had  everyone on the tour quack at kids walking by on the streets. It was really cute and the kids seemed to enjoy the quacking. They even let kids and adults that want to drive the boat when you're out on the water. Only negative is there are a few seats in the back that aren't in the shade. So get there early if you don't want to sit out in the sun, they fill the boat to the max."
"I have been coming here for awhile.  I make a point of getting here when they open at 9:00 a.m. for several reasons.  One is that there are minimal places to park and also when it gets crowded (which is often) it gets very difficult to move around.\n\nThis place seems to attract some of the most interesting patrons but for the most part, they are harmless.  So here is my opinion.  Could use some cleaning, staff pretty friendly, clothes priced medium to high but great selection, furniture-sporadic quality at best, knick knacks/household-priced right.  Books are in a small room which is extremely musty and it really triggers my asthma but good selection.\n\nI will continue to go here to get my thrift store fix.  I really like the mission of St Vinny as I feel that they contribute a lot to people in need and that is one reason I continue to donate and shop here."
"I consider myself a serious bread whore (hello, look at my belly!). So when me and the Mister started settling into our new LV digs I started a mission to find some killer artisan bread to replace my beloved MJ Breads in Phoenix. \n\nAfter kissing and tasting some serious bread frogs around the city I finally discovered Bon Breads while wandering around Town Square. When we walked in I instantly became moist around the lips, I had to eat this bread! We bought 5 loaves however one of them didn't even make it to the car. Amazingly chewy, lightly crisp and a tender open crumb I have to tell ya, these guys over at Bon know what they are doing."
"I just got take-out from Ali Baba. We ordered a bunch of the a la carte items, and there was way too much food. As a note, their website menu prices have been raised by about 50 cents an item, but they're still rather reasonable. I also appreciated that they gave us a whole bag of pita bread to take home.\n\nI whole-heartedly recommend the baba ghanoush and muhammara. They have a chunky texture that makes you wonder if some grandma was pummeling walnuts in the back with a mortar and pestle. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more of their dishes.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the restaurant looked modern and a nice spot for a romantic dinner.\n\nOverall, Ali Baba is going to become a regular for take-out night at my house. I'd recommend picking up a couple large containers of their dips for your next party."
"I can't help it.  I'm going to have to disagree with the other people who reviewed Whole Foods, even the one I happen to share a house with.  I love everything in this place starting and ending with the samples.  Did you know that if you ask an employee about a particular food they are allowed to open it for you to try?  Best tip ever."
"Will start by stating that I am not an avid golfer.  Most any course will challenge me!  For proximity to downtown, and good course conditions, I would return.  Some of the bunkers are the deepest I have ever seen. Royal links was a great way to start the work week in Vegas."
sorry i missed 4th of July here!
"It's a giant used bookstore. It's organized in the best possible way. What more could you ask for? ...however, it is slightly more expensive than I was expecting (it's a USED book??!) :/"
"The five stars is strictly for the garlic infused ranch sauce. #%^*! \n\nThe ranch sauce here is stupid -wicked- good! I'm addicted to the ranch here and I would just come here and buy a tub of it if I could. It's truly insane. \n\nIt's a homemade, rich, buttery buttermilk ranch, but wait, that's not all...infused with roasted garlic flavor?!? I honestly don't know what they put in their ranch, but it set off our pizza dinner to a whole new level. It's what ranch dreams are made of. Flavor rating: 5/5\n\nThe pizza- extra hooked up with cheese, toppings were decent, crust not too shabby. Overall, I would dabble again in their pizzas. Flavor rating: 3/5\n\nThe spicy buffalo wings- small, dry, overcooked, and the seasoning was not memorable. Flavor rating: 1/5\n\nThe garlic knots- 12 free knots with a purchase of a large pizza! That's called a hookup ya'll. The knots were flavorful and moist. I dunked them like crazy in the house ranch. So good! Flavor rating: 5/5\n\nI honestly feel that the ranch enhanced the pizza, wings, and the knots by a lot. Without their house ranch, I would be a sad panda."
This place is walking distance from my work and serves up some awesome Sandwichs. It has a very nastalgic feel to it .
"This is my second review of this place and I really wish I could give Sultan's Grill 5 stars!\n\nThe only thing is the fact that at least 4 separate nights when I came to their restaurant and they were OUT OF LAMB and then today during lunch they were OUT OF SPINACH PIES!\n\nI came around 1pm today so luckily, they didn't run out of  the stuff to make Gyros, Fries and Cucumber Sauce.  I am a fan of those.  I could eat their gyros all day and night.\n\nQuick Tip: They have spinach pies on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays only.  I wish I could have the chance to try it out, though.\n\nAlso, it appears they are open Sundays per the signa posted today."
"Love the pasta dishes however not a fan of the pizza. I usually stick to seafood, chicken or vegie dishes. They offer a good selection and great appetizers as well. The tomato sauce is light and everything is aways fresh. Several people like the pizza however I have had NY style pizza and theirs just did not match up. I actually tried a few different pizzas crust types and still did not find one I liked. With that said I just order pasta vs pizza and enjoy my meal. Service anywhere is always luck of the draw but mine has always been great there."
"I lived in Madison for a year, and whenever I think about missing Wisconsin, my mind goes immediately to the Echo Tap. As people have said, this is a quintessential Wisconsin bar, from the High Life on tap to the darts to the crowd.\n\nI used to go here with a friend every Monday, order a pitcher of High Life (on special, for $4.50 I think) and two shot glasses, and do a power hour at the bar. One time, another patron gave me advice on getting a tattoo and hooked my friend up with a discount for a piercing. Another time, a patron told us how he knew the woman in the moon on the High Life packaging.\n\nThere are darts and pool on the second floor, of course, and the drinks are super-cheap even before their insanely priced specials. The bartender chats with the regulars, and it's an especially fun place to watch Packers games (or depressing, depending on the outcome, but I lived there in 2007 so it was great).\n\nIt's the perfect bar, basically."
I considered having a piercing done.  I had heard Halo was a good place for it.  I went in and discussed what I wanted done and the ramifications.  They were very clear about how long I'd have to stop doing any heavy duty hiking or mountains until it healed.  I was not willing to give that up for as long as they said.  There was no pressure to do it after that.  I appreciated their attitude.
"We went to Vegas for the Sema show for 1 night and needed a place close and cheap. We decided on this hotel a lit bit further since the hotel's on the strip was expensive. So the day before we went I looked at the reviews on Yelp and was scared. So we got to the hotel at 9am and could not check in until 2pm. Of course we did come early. So we came back to the hotel and the ladies at the front desk was so warming and nice. They even upgraded our room. The room was nice had an old odor but over all clean. We had a balcony so that was cool. Saw the lights from the strip. Overall stay was clean, close and definetly worth the $100. I would go back if there was a 1 day event again."
"Ah, let me just say, where else would you get $1.50 rail on Tuesday night? How about a basket of a large fries on top of that?? See, when it comes to the place that really matters, no one comes close to the dise. And, the bartenders are so cool, too ;) If you're a girl, you might get turned off by some gentlemen trying to attract your attention.\n\nBut if you're the type to come here, I know you can handle it. \n\nAnd the bathroom -  brings back the memories of the days when I passed out on it. Dive."
"Our garage door torsion spring broke last night.  We called this morning and got an appointment set up right away.  Kenny showed up on time and fixed the problem in just 20 minutes.  I have read DIY material about how to replace garage door springs, so I know what to expect.  But it is still such a joy to see Kenny do his job so efficiently.  He projects great confidence in what he does, and it makes me very comfortable in knowing that his job is highly reliable.  Not to mention all this is done at a below the market average price!  I will definitely call them again for any garage door problem in the future!"
Bring back Tropicana Fruit Punch.
"Lost the nut holding my front brake in place. Made a quick trip to Landis. The service was fast and friendly. They even had to cut the nut to size. In the end it only cost me a couple of bucks.\n\nAs a freebie, they adjusted my brakes. \n\nVery good experience. Will return."
"I dont know why everybody is bitching about Hooters. This place is Clean, friendly and close to down town. Not to forget you pay only $10 to $45 a night, depending what month you go. The food is Ok and dirt cheap. \nYes sometimes stuff is not working, so yes you have to tell them a couple times to fix it, but it will get done.\nIt helps a lot if you tip $5-$10 cheap ass :D.\n\nPs. FREEEEEEE beer if you play slots. Get loaded for free."
"I'm really still amazed that this place has held it's ground for so long.  It never really seems that busy, but they were pretty packed for a Friday night when I came in.\n\nOur waiter was running around all over the place, but he got the job done.  We almost didn't get our buttered croissants - they were so busy they were all out at the moment, but we got a nice hot batch of them mid-way during our dinner.\n\nThe menu has a ton of options, but I went the steak and potatoes route.  Also tried the seasonal summer brew which was a honey wheat and very excellent.\n\nI'll keep coming back for the beer, but like some people said previously... the place does need a little updating."
"""Amazing collection for PHX!! Well never thought to find this place in this city. So next time I hear people saying there is no art going on in PHX...wait a minute! there is a place!!\n\nHaven't been there in a year, but I will probably stop any \""""first friday\"""""""
"Michael and David are awesome - they always are so helpful and friendly when my car is in trouble. Even when it's closing time, or last minute. \n\nMy car was making an awful noise driving home from work, so I called and Michael said to come by and drop it off - he stayed a little past closing time to help us get checked in. \n\nThe next morning, David called me at 7:50a, with the diagnosis and the fix. And then my car was ready for pick up at 9:45a. \n\nQuick and amazing service. Thank you!"
"""Another father's day, another breakfast at Lolo's.  The fried chicken should be illegal.  Of course, I only got two bites before my daughter, who previously said \""""I'm full\"""", stole my piece.  Darn kids.  \n\nOh yeah, great lemonade, grits and waffles.  Love the staff.  But that chicken...."""
"Great atmosphere, great bartenders, great beer, pretty good clientele... my only complaints are that it can get pretty smokey in there at time and that they are not closer to my house."
"""My boyfriend says, \""""Phat Burrito is just a local Chipotle.\""""\n\n1. There is nothing wrong with that\n\n2. It's better than that because,\n A. They have a salsa bar\n B. They also serve refried beans. I really like refried beans.\n C. Their salads come with a toasted tortilla, seriously the salads are great here\n D. They serve fish\n E. I'm sure other reasons too but this list should have sold you by now."""
"Our dog was attacked by another dog and our usual vet was closed.  Thank God for places like this.  The staff was nice and the vet was extremely attentive to our dog and to us.  The vet and the staff took the time to update us on her status and walk us through what we needed to do for her recovery.  I love my vet, but I definitely recommend this place for emergencies or after hour visits."
"Coffee in the morning, coffee in the evening, coffee at supper time. Ok, you get where this is going. You can have coffee anytime. \n\nObviously I've already had too much caffeine today and Espresso Royale is contributing to that. \n\nI usually go for my favorite: small black coffee, but lately I have been treating myself to lattes because they offer almond milk.  \n\nIn addition to coffee they have sandwiches, yogurt, fruit, brownies, cookies, and some candy for sale. \n\nThe baristas are fast, which is nice for when I'm already 5 minutes late for work.  They also offer different deals each day of the week, such as two-punch Tuesdays. Bring in your coffee card and get two punches for your order!"
"Suburbanites don't seem to know how to deal with a place like Lincoln Square, which is a good thing in my opinion. Instead what was once a dead mall is now an asset to the People's Republic of Urbana :)  It's got mid-century architecture, and a lot of interesting stores that are most definitely not the usual mall chain stores. I like the art supplies store, the quilting shop, and the Chinese restaurant. There's a good sized natural foods supermarket too, but that's a bit too pricey for me. All in all, a great alternative to the hellish shopping areas north of I-74."
"I've been here numerous times over the last 8 years but had yet to go to their happy hour.  The wines are not that inexpensive:  $8 for Chateau Monfort Vouvray Chenin Blanc & Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc to go along with the $9 happy hour specials of cheese plate, lobster monte cristo & a few other items.  On Fri they have jazz from 5-7 but the happy hr is 5-8 on M-F.  So it's a tasty bite & drink which was fun on a Fri nite so you can still go out esp if you need to get in early for Sat."
"My sister had to sell her car quickly before moving out of state. I accompanied her because I agreed to help her by completing the paperwork and the transaction on her behalf after she was gone. She had to leave the state before the transaction could be completed. \n\nWe worked with Marina at the business office. She was awesome! Very friendly, knowledgeable, helpful. The transaction was somewhat complicated, and things went smoothly in general. \n\nWhen I came back to complete the transaction a couple days later, some of the paperwork was misplaced, which made for some tense moments, but it worked out in the end. I would go back to Carmax if I needed to buy or sell a car."
"This place still gets 5 stars for the quality of food and the extremely pleasant service.  Unfortunately, the last time I ate here I noticed that their extremely generous portions have been downsized.  No more leftovers to take home, which is too bad because I love their leftovers.  Also, the mongolian beef I ordered last time was overloaded with scallions.  It's like they were trying to take up space so I wouldn't notice they gave me less meat.  And the meat!  The meat was cooked differently than before.  It was more like the beef in the broccoli beef, which is sauteed and not as spicy.\n\nOkay, after consideration they get 4 stars.  I'm sad."
"I've had many issues with salons in Vegas and stopped getting my nails done for years. A friend recommended this salon and I have been very pleased!  The price is great, they staff are friendly, they do nice work and the place is clean and not over powering in chemical smell. If you can go there when there isn't a line they are very quick.  Weekends are very busy."
"The incredible shrinking restaurant.\nBluephies has always been a family favorite: safe options for kids, interesting options for adults.\nBut tonight we had to pay for bread, and every portion -- including the usually enormous slices of cake -- was smaller than during previous visits.\nAdd in a random toothpick piece left in the appetizer and one wrong entree (to be fair: we were offered a free dessert), and this doesn't seem like the go-to it was a couple of years ago.\n\nUpdate\nThe manager emailed me with a very thoughtful explanation of their changes and her thoughts about my experience. I appreciate not only that she reached out, but that she seemed very specific in her rationale for what they do and why they do it. \nI changed my star rating to reflect my average rating: as I said above, we've been there many times and enjoyed it; I hope that our next visit reflects our typical experience."
"This place is a gem. I'm now living in Boston and we've struggled to find a good place to go for comedy. We've visited NYC and tried a few there and everything fails to meet our expectations after going to college in Madison.\n\nComedy Club on State is by-far the best stand-up comedy club I've ever gone to. Comedians are excellent. It's in a great space with very comfortable seating. Big drink selection with excellent service. The waitresses come by the perfect amount of times and somehow manage to not interrupt your enjoyment of the show.\n\nI've only attended for their main stage shows, so I don't have any feedback on the other acts they host during the week. \n\nWe'll be going to Comedy Club on State every time we visit Madison. My favorite show was one year when we went to a women's night with all female comedians. That was very fun and different! For the first time, there was some humor that I got that my boyfriend didn't rather than the other way around. :)"
"The staff are friendly and helpful.  They seemed really concerned when my cat got sick.  The doctor personally called me when my cat was in the hospital overnight because of kidney stones.  They did follow up calls as well.  Plus the doctor was named Sean Penn, though I don't think it was actually the actor. \n\nThe hours are wonderful.  I would recommend this business to anyone."
"I needed gas grills for a pool. I called the store and the staff  was very helpful. I never had to go to the showroom. They put the grills together, delivered them and offered to install. I did not have them do this, my maintenance people did the job. I could not have asked for a better grill or easier process."
"""These guys are normally backlogged five days and understandably so. The record is impeccable and work is top notch. I was referred here by a few places including the last place to look at my work truck. I called and they said we do free test drives to see what could be wrong. I came in at 10 AM they drove my truck and immediately realized that \""""U\"""" joints were going bad. They quoted me $140 to replace both front and rear and balance the driveline which I thought was extremely fair! I told them I did not have a ride and he said he would get right on it for me. I walked down the street to kill some time at the motorcycle shop. I called for a ride and before I know it they were calling me from Dan's drive line letting me know they had already finished my truck. Talk about service! Dan you and your crew will always receive my business and any of my customers business as well, Thank you!"""
"When there's no food at home, I hit up Jimmy John's for a good ol #10 Hunter's Club (Roast Beef Sandwich) with Dijon Mustard. Can't go wrong with it as long as you like beef. Well, except they messed up the sandwich once by adding onions to it for some reason. Raw onions = -1 star."
"Love this place because the food is creative and not your run of the mill stuff.  The atmosphere is fun but,yes, the acoustics suck so it is loud.  We always try to go when we are in town.  I don't agree that the prices are high.  You get what you pay for and here you are paying for good food that isn't what's on every other menu in a college town."
"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews.  Came here for the champagne brunch and the service was great.  The buffet is only $10 with a player's card and I think the price is appropriate.  I mean, really, anywhere you go a plate of food is going to cost you at least $10.  There is a wide variety of food: breakfast, Asian, Mexican, salad bar, and dessert.  There were a couple things I did not care for (specifically the oranges and eggs benedict), but no one is forcing you to eat something you don't like.    I would return."
"""I have walked/driven past Campus Deli too many times to count and based upon appearances I was never willing to venture inside. A friend had always claimed that they make some of the best subs he had eaten. The combination of his gleaming reviews and their newly redesigned deli finally drew me inside and I was not disappointed.\n\nThey use Boar's Head meat, quality cheeses, and THE BEST sub buns around (perfectly chewy). I ordered \""""The Sophomore\"""", capicola, prosciutto, salami, ham, provolone, sun dried tomatoes, lettuce and vinaigrette. It rocked! Inside is a wall describing their 20-30 sandwiches, all of which sound delicious and are priced between $5-8. Based on the quality of the ingredients, the taste, and the price, I can't think of a single reason to go to Subway or Quizno's."""
"Been here since Monday night and have had my husband checked into ER, floor four and ICU.  Service here is always hit and miss some nurses are outstanding at bed side manor and then their are others that this is really just a job and they are not people persons.  I never understand that because nursing while healing and is a very expertise type job also includes being a people person and polite I think.  All the doctors have been good for the most part and really enjoyed the interventionist.  \n\nI think the food here overall is good for a hospital as well, could be worse.\n\nOverall I don't know that you find anything better anywhere else."
"""They have a really big selection, and I loved that they used nice fresh looking fruit. The only issue that I had is that usually you can find on the menu a \""""lighter\"""" smoothie... you know,non fat milk, sweetened with splenda, or just not adding extra sugar. Didn't really see that on the menu. I'm sure they can make it that way, but still, I want it to be nice and obvious for me. I guess I'm just spoiled like that. \nThe Acai smoother I got was great, hit the spot perfectly."""
I couldnt believe it. Patching up any tires was free. And they didnt not try to sell or talked me into having to take out any money. This is gonna be my new tire place hands down.
"My husband and I are new to the Charlotte.  While there are numerous places to eat, not all are worth the money. We didn't have any expectations going in but beyond pleased leaving. We both had Chicken Parmesan. It was the best I've ever tatsed. We spent under 40 dollars and had lots of food to take home. The serving was a large one. The atmosphere was relaxing and the Sangria Wine was absolutely wonderful.  Our waiter was patient and very knowledgeable of the menu and specials. We will definitely return!"
"Still tops, but more delays \n\nI'm a fan of Southwest on the bases of their on-time scores, low lost luggage rates, I-can-do-it staff attitude, and overall cost.  The queue system for seating doesn't bother me and I find it worth the Early Bird fee to get on a bit sooner.  The math is that it's a very effective way to administer a variable demand system.\n\nMy only knock is that after many flights with no delays, I've seen three delays on recent trips.  We ended up making up some time in the air on two of those flights, which is cool.  Just hoping it's not a pattern."
"Honest and fair.  Took in my car without an appointment and completed the service within the promised time.  As a guy who does most of his own car repairs, I know that I can trust them.  I knew the problem before heading in and they gave the same diagnosis."
"""So I always passed this but never quite stopped in. One night a few months ago BF and I had a rental car while his was in the shop. It was a nice night, it was a convertible, so it asked for a drive. This just caught our eye and we rolled in. \n\nBF and I shared a Stir Fryed Deer and some seafood chowfun.  So the \""""deer\"""" was good, but I really don't think it was deer. LOL it tasted like I was having Mongolian Beef for $4 more. Shoot...I was excited that they had odd meats but I couldn't tell the damned difference. Tasty- but that wasn't deer..Chowfun was tasty and we had quite a bit to take home for lunch. \n\nI think it's a good late night option and I'm very curious about some of the odd offerings on the menu...sometimes I just feel like some exotic down home Chinese foods. One in particular is the Ox Tail with Red Wine. I had this in Hong Kong and been dying to have some again but I don't ever see it on menus. To be continued....that dish is on my want list."""
Delish! I will be back and it's only 5 min away!!! Bun Bo Hue was very tasty but... I'm from the bay area and they are missing a few key ingredients =(
"These guys always seem to have what I need and typically the right knowledge to help me out. Too bad there aren't more locations, but they are more geared towards industry as opposed to the DIY'er."
"If this place were cheaper we'd visit all the time. Some of the displays are kind of boring, but there are some great rooms where you can walk right up and chill with the birds.  We missed the show because we didn't know it was being held outside and no one informed us when we bought our tickets :/"
"I'm from Philly and was in Pittsburgh about ten years ago.  The bartender across the street at Primanti's wouldn't serve me.  All I wanted was a sandwich and a beer.\n\nAnyway, I walked over to Joe Mama's and ate the best stuffed pork chop I ever had in my life.  The young waitress was attractive, friendly, and good at her job.  Highly recommend this place."
"This is really a 3.5 but I'm going to bring it up to a 4 because it was quick and really inexpensive.\n\nI don't really think I'm a Mexican food connoisseur by any means but I do know good food in general and I have to say I wasn't really impressed.  I mean I was expecting to be blown away, which I guess is my own fault.  My enchilada was no better than any other enchilada I've ever had.  The salsa was good but the chips were not...they almost tasted stale.  I did enjoy the patio area, it provided a good background for lunch with a group."
"4 stars for having a $3 blackjack table (one, singular)\n4 stars for having $5 card tables\n\nNever stayed here.\nHaven't eaten here.\n\nSuper chill dealers.\n\nNot tons of room to gamble.\nCrowded tables.\nSuper mixed crowd in terms of everything...\n\nTrying to gamble for cheap and get drunk? Yeah come here."
"It was 7pm on a Sunday, St. Patricks day, and we were out-of-towners looking for dinner near our hotel in Charlotte.  We were surprised to find that most restaurants were closed.  Azteca was the fourth one that we tried and, finding it open, decided to give it a try.\n\nWhen we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  There was a plate of food on display which looked kind of congealed and gross - it had probably been there the whole day - and made me question whether dinner there was a good idea.\n\nThere was no wait for our table.  When we were seated, they promptly brought us delicious chips and salsa.  Our waitress was very kind.  We ordered four different dishes and shared - they were all fabulous.  Large portions for great prices.  There was also a woman walking by with a cart making fresh guacamole on request.  She was adorable and I loved that she made it right in front of us.\n\nOverall, Azteca was not a place I probably would have chosen first but I'm really glad we stumbled upon it.  A great find!"
Thick cripsy bacon.  The best bacon in the world.  mmmmm...bacon.  Supposedly they have great pancakes but who the hell knows.  Its all about the thick cripsy tasty bacon.  Just kidding the pancakes are great and the omlettes are huge.  My favorite were the blueberry with the real blueberries in them not some crappy jam type substance.  They have some other Original House of Pancakes throughout the midwest and I even went to one in Hawaii.  If you go get the bacon.  OHOP closes early on the weekend.  Nothing is worse than being hungover thinking about bacon driving from campus and finding out its closed.  Call ahead.
"We flew from phx to newark and back with a 1 year old. I was so nervous and there was no need to be. Us airways was so accommodating and helpful. Everything was right on schedule all bags, car seat, stroller was right where it needed to be at all times. The flight attendant were so helpful. They even gave us a free seat for our baby! The only thing is the flight food is HORRIBLE. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars."
"I had a great experience with Precision. We were on a roadtrip and stopping in Vegas for only a couple of days and developed a frightening problem with our brakes before we arrived. Took our Corolla to Precision (based on their excellent reviews and Toyota specialization) to see what the problem was. The waiting area is comfortable and welcoming, and they were very friendly. Most importantly, of course, they found my problem (broken shim), fixed it within an hour, and sent me on my way AT NO CHARGE. They waved away my trying to pay them, claiming it was such an easy fix, and wished me luck on my trip. Even without incentives to get my future business (as I don't live in LV), they still acted with great integrity and service, which are rare qualities. Highly recommend!"
"I come here with my husband/for my husband, It's cool, I love the big pink octopus squishy, I want him so badly but he's like 150$  :( maybe some day!\n\nIt was packed with guys playing with figurines and cards last time I came here, a word of advice...require showers or invest in a better ventilation/ air fresheners"
"Not sure what's with Erin. I guess she got towed for parking in the wrong spot :]\n\nThis deli is nice and I like their pastrami a bunch.  Keep in mind this is in the Heart of Dilworth. The average house in a 5 block radius is about 800k.  So, yes you will see yuppies with kids.  That's pretty obvious.  Their sweet tea is pretty good as well.  Its just a deli, but their big plus is that they have a huge outdoor patio.  Its great in the spring and fall when the weather is more bearable and the perfect spot for those people watchers."
"When I move away from Madison, and it will happen someday, I might have to spring for a plane ticket every 2 months so I can have Jen at 924 cut my hair. She's the only one who has ever gotten it completely right, every single time."
"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hotel. After reading the negative reviews, I was a bit skeptic, but everything was really nice. The front staff was wonderful. The manager's reception was pleasant. Great breakfast, clean rooms, etc. I was a little annoyed I had to pay for WiFi, but fortunately I was traveling for work. The only downside here is the area of town it is in. I walked to the convenience store down the block and that was a mistake. Creepy, creepy."
"I am only 5 feet tall with short arms and short waisted, so nearly everything needs to be altered. I consider it a blessing to have discovered Christies more than 10 years ago. Christie is so sweet, always welcoming, and really listens to what you want. She guarantees that you'll be happy with the alteration, or her team will re-do the item. Turn around time is quick and pricing is very reasonable for the quality and attention to detail. I live in SC and wouldn't go anywhere else."
"If this restaurant  was closer to my house , i would come here more offten , the portions are huge. jus the way i like it. I had the chorizo omelet with chedder. I skipped the potato and had  a side of tomato instead :( dam diet. I had the potatos before and they are great ,cut a little thicker then chips.  The country fried steak looked good, i think i might try that next time. Service was very good."
Ok I want to give this place 5 stars but I always get the same thing so it may not be fair. This is a real authentic Mexican restaurant from the music to the decor. Be prepared to be the only gringos and brush up on your espanol! The tortillas are hot and had made and the salsa is warm. The service is always friendly and hard working but communication can be a challenge. Honestly I enjoy the hand talking and gestures feels like I am on vacation. This is not 5 star Michelin cuisine but down home Mexican. The prices are cheap and the food is really good. Now andale to Allende!
"Best falafel I've ever had. The atmosphere is fantastic and it's in my favorite neighborhood in Charlotte. This is my favorite restaurant to visit when I'm in Charlotte. Now, there is a rather simple reason for not giving it three stars. For an establishment that serves so much alcohol, it's rather unfortunate that the grill closes at midnight. Maybe it's because I'm not a local, but I'm not used to that but, aesthetically, the place looks like more of a diner than a bar, so I expected to be able to stop here after the other bars were closed. I feel that it's bad for business, but good for the employees. Heh. Either way, I'll keep coming back."
I have a French bulldog & an English bulldog. I had an issue with my Frenchy when we first got stationed at Nellis. We took her here because our neighbors told us to give them a try. I'm glad I did! They are on the cheaper side for vet care but cheap vet prices don't actually exist. We just had to make an emergency trip there for my English bulldog tonight. They got him in for surgery right away. All patched up and out the door for under $200! Including two medicines for the next week. My bulldogs are like my kids. I'd pay almost anything to keep them healthy and happy but shockingly low prices are way better than the usually shock of their vet costs!
They get my coffee order right most of the time. Sometimes the cup has coffee dripping on the side which makes it messy in a car cup holder. But that is the exception fortunately.
"Every place that sells food needs to be rated against peers -- so you don't compare a Jack to a Stratta or anything. So this place really needs to be pitted against other places, and in particular those in the immediate neighborhood, I think. \n\nThis place is great, and probably the best food choice when you're in that area. In the immediate area, there this, a Taco Bell (or Del Taco, I forget), McDonald's, and Wienerschnitzel. This place is always the fastest, provides the best food, and generally has the coolest people working there in that they're polite.\n\nOne time I went down here and I was starving after having worked a double shift. I rolled through the drive through and thought I should get enough food for then, plus some snacks for later. I ordered four tacos, curly fries, and jalapeno poppers AND IMMEDIATELY ATE THEM ALL. And all of the food was good and hot. Can't mess with that."
This restaurant is in an old Catholic church which gives it a great atmosphere. The menu is full of great comfort foods. They offered pizza with pierogi toppings which I didn't order and it still haunts me to this day that I didn't get it. It's like my white whale......damn you church brew!
"I'm a total coffee snob. I'm spoiled by having a Starbucks in my building at work and they are my go to when I need a cup of java. That being said, it may not be true for too long all because of Dilworth Coffee. Their East Blvd is a charming location with friendly and knowledgeable employees along with indoor and outdoor seating. I get their Butterscotch Toffee drip coffee anytime I go and it's nice to have a smooth, robust coffee without the burnt taste that the Bucks can sometimes have. However, recently I've been addicted to their Iced vanilla lattes, I have to stop myself from slurping it down in three sips---it's so much better than the Bucks. \n\nYou can go to their website and sign up for special promotions, coupons and such!"
"""There is no shortage of \""""New York Style\"""" pizza places in the Charlotte area - especially as you get up to the Northeast. Funny how that works. It's not like they put them on the South side of town. Almost like a mini-map of the country or something. Anyway.\n\nDue Amici, while currently a bit challenging to get to because of (or due to) the 485 construction, is worth a slight drive out of your way. There are other places that are simpler to find, and some are even right off of the freeway. But take the time and find your way to Due Amici and you can find a number of slices that are well worth the effort.\n\nNaturally they have things other than pizza, as any good joint will, but if it's right there in the name, should you really try anything else?"""
Nice upscale shopping with great stores. It's outdoors though so summer time may not be the best to visit
"""Vegan fuckin' donuts dude.\n\nEvery other donut bakes up wishing it could be these donuts. \n\nThis will be the best thing you put in your mouth in the mornings before work or the mornings after partying on the strip (or you know, both at the same time).

"I was back in town a month ago or so, and we went out to Crane Alley. I saw someone else posted something I felt that night - they expect you to stay in your assigned seats. I definitely noticed that. From now on, I will only go later on at night when there aren't so many groups out. Still - awesome beer selection and bartenders!"
"""I walked into the office this morning (with slight post-Super Bowl haze) and quickly realized that it was my turn to bring in breakfast.  D'OH!   Panic mode.  The good folks at Bruegger's on the Southside helped me to recover with an amazing quick turnaround after my high-speed jaunt across the Birmingham Bridge.  Excellent bagels and some other options like muffins, cookies, great sandwiches and more.  I love the fact that these bagels taste like \""""real bagels\"""" compared to Panera.  I also love the fact that they have Smoked Salmon cream cheese (even though I might be in the minority on that one)!   Thanks Bruegger's - I got hammered and harrassed by co-workers but it could have been worse."""
"drive thru, avoid going in there. i always get the Hawaiian Blizzard! yumo"
"It's a tiny place (but with very visible yellow exterior) conveniently located close to the UW campus and next to Indie Coffee. I brought my boots, which had loud noise making plastic-wood heel and asked to replace the plastic with rubber. The owner (I assume his name is Franco) is a very welcoming, friendly guy, and the work took only 2 days. I was very satisfied with the work, and best of all, it was only $5! Now I can wear my fabulous Fyre boots without feeling self-conscious about the noise (shoes are now very quiet even on a hard surface)."
Love this place except for being seated near the drink station pretty much in the kitchen. That's kinda lame. Otherwise this place is next to amazing.
"Funny how I can't cook to save my life and I am always browsing through their kitchenware.  Although I'm not an avid tea drinker, I like to pretend I am and I've bought a couple tea sets from here that are quite darling.  There's an amazing olive oil section that blows my mind--a bit pricey but I've been cooking quite a bit with EVO and experimenting is fine by me. There's also a great selection off to the right of the store that holds appropriate gifts for weddings, mothers and such.  I like looking through cards and love the journals I've found here.  One of these days I will be worthy enough to purchase quality pots and pans and cutlery from their upstairs gallery.   Before the summer is up, I aim to take a cooking class here.  For sure with Shinji Muramoto, yes as in THE Restaurant Muramoto and Sushi Muramoto.  Cute and quaint.  If you are here after 4, make sure not to park on the street as they will tow."
"Right on, Right Touch!\nIs this the closest place to me to drop my goods? \nNo.\nIs it the fastest I've found in town?\nYup! \nAnd that's enough to make me wanna drive a bit out of my way, to know two days later I'll have the bajillion shirts, sweaters, pants and usually a piece of bedding back. I bet if I planned better I wouldn't be so stressed to get everything back so quickly. But because I can't plan, and because I take everything there at once leaving me a Yelp hoodie and a pair of olive khakis I wore when I was 23, time is of the essence. They're friendly, thorough, and if you peep their website or shop at Woodman's across the street you'll have some coupons handy for big orders. \nLike all of mine. \nI find the prices are right on par with other places in Madison, cheaper in some cases depending on the bulk quantity. And I like the folks there and get a good feeling about the joint."
"This was my rebound dinner after a horrible first experience at Whataburger.\nWhat-a-difference.\n\nThe carne asada and pollo were delicious but the barbacoa was kinda eh.\n\nAnd what was the story with the salsas? They're set out on the three shelves of a rolling cart, some low enough that you have to crouch down to serve yourself. I realize that you guys were near closing but that's just too close to the floor for my taste.\n\nThe salsa thing puts 'em at risk for loosing a star but after such horrible food at Whataburger this place tasted like food from Heaven.\n\n2013 #3 / 365"
"If you like to order your drinks by color and suck from a fistful of straws from a fishbowl...and watch college kids fight and vomit, Wando's is the place for you...and it is fun, the boys are cute and unconcious, what more could you ask for?"
"Great place, shop was packed but they took care of my tire that blew out on 28 when I had no spare and Mr tire told me it would take all day to sell me and Change one tire. A little pricey, but it was worth it. They were really busy, all bay's full but still only took fifteen minutes to change my tire. Did it right out in the lot.  Thank you guys so much. I recommend this place to anyone in a bind like I was."
Yesterday I went to purchase my usual 10 lb bag of royal basmati rice but the price has increased from $14.99 to $16.99. I then searched and found that amazon is selling it for cheaper and I will be ordering from amazon from now on. Kohli is still a good place for Indian delicacies. They have great coconut oil for hair and skin. They also have Indian veggies to make some yummy meals.
My only negative is cigarette smoke smell. Ok with that out of the way. Cheese curd is good brat was good. Beer was good. Waitress was good. Decor is cool. They have signs everywhere that are fun to read.
"I highly recommend Dave's Metro Auto Glass to anyone who needs auto glass replacement or repairs. My car was broken into and the thief shattered my passenger side window. I called Dave's. They came out the same day I called. Not only did they provide a great service, they also cleaned up the broken glass from my previous window I did not get around to cleaning. They made my window replacement easy and no trouble at all. They even came to my work to take are of this matter, so it saved me the time I would have taken going somewhere else! Highly recommended!!!"
I went in thinking I needed to replace my brake pads.  They told me they were fine and just offered some maintenance work.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.
My sister went back after I was contacted by someone from the bakery due to my original review. Apparently I'm not the only one who had complaints about this particular employee (who is no longer working there). My sister's second experience was completely different and so much better! She is so happy to be getting exactly what she wants and I can't wait to taste the final product.
These guys helped us out when we were in a really bad spot. They did the repair quickly and in the time estimated. They were able to salvage our axle housing despite having been bent. They had a specialist from Cali come to do a very vital operation on it. Excellent service. Great quality work.
"A Bears fan going to a Packers bar doesn't make a lot of sense.  However, I do like the Red Hydrant Ale, the beer cheese soup and the last brewfest I attended despite the weather moving me inside. All good."
"It's Panera.  They're the same everywhere.  They've spent millions on figuring out what we want, so they've basically figured it out.  It's pretty good, pretty cheap...  You know, I wish some local would come up with something better but what can I say?  I'm not going to force-feed myself crap just because I won't support some corp.  What can ya do?  It's good stuff..."
"I read a lot of reviews complaining about how dry or cold the chicken was... I've been here a couple of times (ordering take-out) and it has been juicy, flavorful, and warm each time.  I'm not a huge fan of their sides, to be honest, but the chicken is delicious so I'll be coming back."
"Decent coffee. Fine service. Nostalgia in the worst way. A buck off for having to stand around because someone was chatting outside is reasonable. Nice seating outdoors. OK cracked seats and biting flies but so what. This is my coffee spot and I'm stickin to it, never mind that I live 1500 miles away."
"I struggled with cystic acne for YEARS before visiting Dr. Thompson and Dr. Brown.  I went to med-spas, got chemical peels, microdermabrasions, used the Clarisonic, bought expensive cleansing agents, washed my face 3 times a day, tried birth control and antibotics and hormone suppressants.  Absolutely nothing worked until this summer when I visited the Dermatologic Laser Center and they prescribed Accuntane for my condition.  \n\nIt is a busy practice so it can be hard to get the appointment time you want BUT I've never waited more than 5 minutes to see the doctor.  I feel like the whole staff really listens to me and educates me about my options, and thoroughly answers all my questions.  I have seen an AMAZING improvement in my skin and will be forever grateful to the people who work at the Dermatologic Laser Center.  Thanks y'all!!!"
Great service! Ok food. Delicious key lime pie!\n\nI recently moved to Pittsburgh and I don't know if its just the east side of the country or just me but it seems every time I go out to eat I always get horrible service. But this is my first restaurant experience in the burgh where the service was absolutely wonderful!! From the hostess to the server they were so friendly and did everything a person in the customer service business should do. I wish I had something better to say about the food but the truth is I have had much better at worse restaurants. But I'll definitely go back for dessert and maybe try something else on the menu.
"""This is my  \""""go to\"""" nail salon in the Plaza Midwoodish area.

"I've been donating blood for decades. It's one of the few morally unambiguous things you can do these days. In addition, I have many friends who cannot donate for a variety of reasons so I try to take up the slack. I usually donate at work but, because of the summer, they skipped a cycle so I checked at the ARC to see about walk-ins.\n\nWest Madison's ARC center wins the prize for the quickest donation EVER! Granted, it was slow day over there and I know the ropes but, I was out in 45 minutes! After quick, friendly and professional attention, I was sipping OJ, eating a cookie and walking out with a free loaf of Panera bread (on Thursdays and Fridays) under my arm in less than an hour.\n\nI won't suggest that you'll get through that quickly but, if you can, donating blood should be a thing.

"There is a lot to say about this restaurant and many will give you mixed responses.\n\nFirst off, I'll say (boldly) that this restaurant serves the best and most authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food in Pittsburgh. The dishes are so flavorful and well-done that your taste buds will relish in happiness. Dishes of note are the Kimchi Seafood Hotpot, Taiwanese Chunk Chicken (aka three cup chicken), and Beef Noodle Soup.\n\nNow for some cons. The restaurant staff will try to shoo you away during peak hours, often cleaning up your food and drink without asking for your permission. While this may seem rude, I can understand because the place is really small and they want to make sure people who are waiting for a table are seated. You need to accept that this will happen during peak hours. If you don't like it, come at off-peak hours.\n\nSome of the really good dishes are quite pricey, but it's well worth it. You're stomach and taste buds won't complain one bit."
"Went in there on Thursday, planning to simply ask some questions, get some ideas. I was pretty sure I wanted a hybrid but, overwhelmed by the vast amount of information I was seeing when doing internet research, I decided to just go talk to experts. A friend of mine pointed me to Thick Bikes and I'm glad he did. For over 2 hours, Chris helped me with showing me bikes, answering super noobish questions, letting me test drive various models, and providing zero pressure sales help. That last point was greatly appreciated because, especially when faced with an expensive purchase, the last thing I would want would be to be pressured into the wrong thing. Chris genuinely cared that I was happy with what I got, didn't try to forcefully upsell me on extras, and left me with such a positive attitude towards them that I will never go elsewhere for my bicycle needs. If you want a chill place, with super nice and knowledgeable staff, and a great selection, I don't know why you would ever consider going anywhere else."

"I don't go here as often as I used to, which is a shame.\n\nThe Pretzel Shop is another Pittsburgh Institution. Made on the premises in large quantities, you can also buy a ton for very little. It makes places like Auntie Anne's look like amateurs. The pretzels taste great, and taste even better when you take home a full bag of 'em to eat later.\n\nThe sandwiches I've had here have been enjoyable as well. I usually get the sweet sausage pretzel sandwich or the open faced veggie pretzel. They're both tasty faves and I never had one of either that I felt was not up to scratch. The various cookies and other pastries they sell here are also quite good.\n\nI've never seen The Pretzel Shop not busy. When I've gone in and it's been relatively empty, it only took about ten seconds before there were four or five people behind me. I've based trips to the South Side specifically to go here.

If you are at Hooters for the boobs or the chicken...you're in the right spot. If you are there to gamble or actually hang out...there are better options. (like the strip ACROSS the street)\n\nYou go to Hooters to look at the boobs and eat their wings! Don't mess up the rotation! lol
"Dropped in this hole in the wall on a whim as we were driving home from PAM. As soon as you step inside you are transported back to the late 70's early 80's AZ. This place reminded me of spots I used to do e at with my folks as a kid. Classic. \n\nThe service was prompt, and friendly, but not overbearing, which is our preference. We had the pot stickers - which were amazing; the chop suey with all whit chicken - very tasty, and the fried rice.  For two people, this was plenty of food.\n\nThe prices were very reasonable.\n\nThis place is old school. You can tell the food is made from fresh ingredients - not pre-mixed, pre-packaged, like other Chinese places. \n\nLoved it. 3 generations from the same family have owned and run this local establishment since 1928....that says smothering!"
"not too sure how drunk works but i think my tastebuds work just the same no matter how drunk i am. with that said i wish there was hand sanitizer after the nights of debauchery followed by antoon's pizza. 5 bucks is great for a cheese pizza no matter what. The dough isnt super gluten-y, its got a good crunch to it but still soft and fluffy on the inside. random tip: powdered sugar on the pepperoni is so good- so what if the pizza is $6.50? you'll be smiling all night, its so good. \n\nbtw twins work there! one is much cuter than the other =D"
"The vegetable subgum is great.  I love that they aren't overly concerned with American palettes not enjoying certain Chinese vegetables and going for authenticity instead.  The noodles are tasty.  The gyoza are really great.  I even like the eggrolls there, and normally I hate eggrolls.  They also have a variety of southeast Asian dishes; that just confuses me.\n\nIt's really reasonably priced.  I almost always get noodle soup for $7 and get two hearty meals out of it.  \n\nThe atmosphere is the atmosphere of most good Chinese restaurants...total shit, but that isn't why you go here.  Also, don't expect amazing service.  Most of the servers are kind of awkward and seem to not really know what they're supposed to be doing.\n\nBest Chinese in Madison hands down."
"I'm quite surprised I haven't written a review for this place already. \n\nIn a town lacking in quality Chinese cuisine, this is a shining star. I used to be a regular a few years back, but since discovering lots of other treats around town and becoming an addict for trying something new each time I go out, I have neglected poor Joyful House. \n\nI have never had a bad meal here. They have lots of selection and their staff is extremely friendly and welcoming! Some of my favorites are Peking Duck, Eggplant and Pork Claypot, Salt & Pepper Prawns and too many more dishes that I can't think of off the top of my head. They have something for everything. Orange Blossom Beef for the less adventurous in your group or Steamed Fish and Sea Cucumber for the authentic Chinese Food Palates.\n\nThey have great hours, open late for you night owls and great food. I have tried quite a number of dishes on their menu and I haven't ever really been disappointed. I have to make sure I keep them in my rotation more often now that I'm reminded. YUM."
"this place used to be way better, when we were single. now that it's considered the hipster mecca of downtown phoenix, it's just kind of boring.\n\nthe drinks are still cheap, the bartenders are still nice, and the place is still a hole inside, but it's just not as fun as it used to be. still some good dj's like boris and alex and shane, but we're just sick of always seeing the exact same crowd.\n\nif someone gets murdered in or near this place, we'll probably start coming back. until then, we'd rather go to real dive bars, not hipster havens. \n\nduring the day is cool, so just go there on a sunday afternoon for $1 pbr with all the local bums and crack addicts getting faced.\n\nalso it pisses us off that they keep painting over the art in the bathrooms. mike little's murals were awesome."
"""Best place in Las Vegas to get your brakes checked and worked on. The work is honest, they show you exactly what is wrong with your car... And this is the first time that I've gotten just 1 axle fixed (they told me my front brakes were good), as it seems other places ALWAYS find \""""something\"""" wrong with something else. They showed me the standard minimum thickness for my rotors, and physically showed me that mine were too thin. They work by appointment, so everything was done in a timely manner (less than an hour)... And the price was HALF of what a \""""name brand\"""" company quoted me. Needless to say, I was very pleased with the service, and definitely encourage everybody to get your brakes done here!"""
"""I love St. Francis.  The staff there is very friendly and kind.  Recently, my dog cut her eye open and I called several \""""Emergency\"""" hospitals.  Not one hospital was willing to see my dog right away.  Instead, I called St. Francis (my usual vet) and they saw here right away and did surgery.  Also, I have found that they will beat any price found on petmeds.com or others on flea and tick medications.  Lastly, they are extremely reasonable and I have never questioned a bill or their methods.  \n\nYou will become a raving fan like me."""
"I was here most often when I lived in Mt. Washington.  The scene is pretty twisted.  You've got some local thugs that may be visiting from Allentown and you'll also have just  your regular types like me and other older locals. Sometimes you'll see a few folks in suits.   The bartenders are pretty good most of the time.  They used to have one guy named Dustin who had a pretty good record with beating the spread in football games.  The food is surprisingly good bar food.  I think their mozzarella sticks are the best i've had, and super healthy for you.  And, by healthy I mean not physically but mentally.  One last thing, it's neither a resort or a yacht club."
"""Can't believe I haven't written a review for one of my favorite cheap place to eat! I have been coming here for years, honestly don't remember how I stumbled across this \""""restaurant\"""" since it is more a grocery store. The dine in portion is on the side.  My favorite items are kafta sandwich (wrap) and lentil soup. By far my favorite lentil soup in town. $3.99 and $2.50 makes for a semi healthy and cheap meal. Personally I think the beef kabobs for $9 is a little steep because you don't get much food.  \nThis is a hole in the wall type place, don't expect anything fancy (decor or service). But this is a solid spot to eat."""
"I love this little place. Honestly. It solves my problems. If you are like me and can't be counted on to spend less than 30 minutes fucking AGONIZING over your booze selections, this is your place. The store is small, but what it lacks in variety it more than makes up for in quality. I'm a beer hound and I constantly marvel over the interesting beers they sell. Lots of cool one-offs from Madison breweries and great stuff well beyond the borders of The People's Republic. Star also boasts a nice wine selection. I'm not a wine guy but I do know that when I say some stupid shit to my lady it's gonna cost me roughly one bottle of Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. The staff is very nice and helpful and there always seems to be a happy puppy in the store which is a total win in my book."
"usually mirabelle is unbelievably good, but DON'T GO ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON! my chocolate croissant was incredibly stale and old, and being in the warming tray made it really crispy. too buttery, too (and believe me, i love butter). the staff don't seem to have the right attitude either, the music was all wrong and the girl who helped me wasn't the right kind of snobby. \n\n\ni'm still giving it a four because they have the best chocolate chip cookies i've ever tasted, and in the morning their bread is delicious"
"I came here to buy miso paste, as Giant Eagle doesn't sell it, and the Japanese grocery store on Ellsworth is closed on Mondays. This store had a few options, but I found the plain red miso I bought to be a little expensive ($4.99)."
Being from Northern California.....missing having Round Table Pizza.  My favorite thin crust pizzzzza
I have been here one time ad was in a hurry. I only ordered bubble tea. Superior to Lu Lu's Noodles. I grabbed a menu and definately plan on returning so long as I can find a place to park.
"It's time to top off the tank before heading back to LA.\n\nThe price on the sign showed $3.69 but when I get to the pump it's $3.64.  SWEET!\n\nOne thing about Phoenix, you can drive 3-4 miles and gas prices from station to station may vary only a few cents, up to 3 or MAYBE 5 cents per gallon regardless of brand,  it's very consistant, unlike LA.    In LA I've driven a mile or two and see prices vary as much as 15 - 20 cents a gallon from one station to another!\n\nQT has a nice decent sized store with plenty of munchies, including REAL food like sandwichws, salads, etc, plus beverages and other snacks.   It's always been clean inside and the staff has always been nice."
"My precious pooch attends Pup Scouts at Alta Vista and wow, do they have the doggie day care business down. I've been to Dog Day Care facilities all over the city and this is the one that's stuck. The staff are caring, well-trained and do perform a temperment test on new pups. The dogs rotate between one-on-one time with each other, with employees, and group time. This is the first place my dog has ever willingly gone knowing I was going to leave him. \n\nOllie gives Alta Vista four paws up!"
After reading the other reviews I was hesitant to bring my RV here.  My experience was 5 star all the way.  They people are great and very friendly. They took care of a list of maintenance request and a couple problems I was having all with in the time promised.   I will be back.
These guys are super helpful and friendly and have never tried to upsell or sell me stuff I didn't need. Always have great advice and inventory. Saved me a bunch of money on parts when I flipped my single axle to get more clearance on the trailer.
"The fact that I can generally get whatever I want on a 50% sale or a 40% off an item coupon is enough for me to come on in repeatedly to a store generally abhorred by my gender!  I can see how perhaps the giant silk flowers display or the creepy Halloween-in-June aisles might throw some people into terror. \n\nHowever, they have a giant selection of hobby paints, top-quality brushes, and even excellently discounted frames for manly man posters of cars or bikini models or cars in bikinis.  So don't think it's all cake toppers and baby photo albums!  It's just... mostly."
"Sure the idea of bbq from a chain restaurant is a turn-off but Famous Dave's really is a good place.  The ribs are good the sauce is good, the brisket is good. $3 margaritas every day.  Tonight our ribs were just a little tough and our server could have done a touch better, but we are fans and always like our dinner here."
Food: 5\nDecor: 5\nAmbiance: 5\nService: 4.5\nValue: 5
Honest and fair. The owner is the one who works on your car so you know he is serious about the business. Friendly and quick. It is a little pricey though.
"This is more of a 3.5 stars. \n\nI come here pretty often for dinners. I am sad to see all the negative reviews for this place but at the same time can see how it is justified. I love the vibe of this place and the view of the lake here. Place, it has a nice little wine shop in front so you can pick out your wine there for your dinner. This is a great place for dinner during the spring and summer times. The vibe you get from this place is fantastic and the food is delicious. However, the service is rather mediocore and needs improvement. The waiters/waitresses here are not very attentive. Sometimes no one pays attention to you for 30-40 minutes and your food is no where in sight for an hour or so. They make mistakes with bills and orders too. I tend to forgive them as I love all other things about this place."
"Best place for cheesesteaks anywhere! Their fries are just right, too. The only thing is that they have a bunch of annoying rules (no refills, only take cash, you don't get fries when you get a sandwich to go) but the quality of their sandwiches makes up for all the trouble."
"Great pizza, and everything else.... those jalopenos will kill ya the next day...."
"I was in a car crash on 8/10/08 and came to Pittsburgh to do rehabilitation after my spinal cord injury. I decided to join the JCC to do additional rehab exercises.\n\nThe facility is very nice. They have many treadmills, ellipticals, 2 arc trainers, recumbent steppers & ellipticals. The have a room with Cybex weight machines. There is a walk/run track on the 2nd floor, along with a dance studio with a mirrored wall. There's also a room with free weights, a pool, and racquetball court.  \n\nLike most exercise facilities, it is very crowded during peak hours. There is usually someone there to coordinate sign in sheets to make sure that people adhere to the time limits. I usually try to go during off peak hours.\n\nWith my recent disability, I found the facility to be very accessible and the staff are very friendly and helpful.\n\nI would definitely recommend this facility to others."
"Finally a bar that has obviously been around a long time.  Late 30's, early 40's crowd.  Slow going even on a Saturday at 6pm.  Not a great burger but not bad either.  A little over-cooked, but solid.  Hot french fries.  I'll be sure to visit again and try other items on the menu mainly because of the full bar.  They have a respectable selection of draft beers, scotches and vodkas.  There's billiards and video games but nobody's paying attention to that.  \n\nIt's hard to categorize because it's mellow enough to have a conversation even with the juke box playing and plenty of people watching games on multiple TVs.  It doesn't feel like a sports bar.  This place has charm and warmth.  Something a lot of newer bars in town are missing.  This is a true neighborhood pub."
"Their sign mentions ice cream and onion rings, but I go for the burgers. The place feels like a diner, but you order at the counter then find a seat. If you can find a seat. There is seating outside, but August in Charlotte does not always make a comfortable outdoor eating environment. \n\nThe burgers taste like they are grilled in your backyard over a charcoal grill. There is a list of toppings on the menu board, ala 5 Guys. But for a couple of dollars less than 5 Guys, and just as good. I haven't tried other selections on the menu, it's a double Mr K with lettuce, mayo, grilled onions and jalapeno peppers each time I stop in. Keep it up Mr. K!"
"I have not found a good, authentic Chinese restaurant, but when I tried this place with some family members...how should I say this...I saw a clearing (after a search for decent Chinese food) hehehe...\n\nWe ordered their Hong Kong Style Chow Mein, Tofu & Eggplant w/ Shrimp Sauce, a Chilean Sea Bass dish, and my fave....their Crispy House Chicken! I was actually impressed with their quality of food. Service was pretty good, but they took a while to give us our tab after it got busy (I guess that's good that they don't rush you!). \n\nI will be eating here more often now that this place has been discovered....(maybe I should just venture down Spring Mountain more often!)"
"Best chicken cheesesteak in the world.  Period.  And like everyone says, the fries obviously have liberal amounts of crack.  The waffle fries were even better, but I went back recently to find that they are not seasoned and not quite as good.  Minus one star for that."
"As a broke college student this place is a god-send.\nIt is cheap chinese food close to my apartment, I have tried their general tso's tofu and their tofu pad thai. \nBoth around $6 and both pretty greasy.  What concerns me is how fast the food comes out, in less than 5 minutes I have gotten my food.  \nIt is a good place to have once a week, more than that its just plain disgusting. \nI'll keep going there while I am attending Pitt because its a tolerable place to eat"
"Note: for sushi bar. Did not go for Hibachi (because I've had enough of Benihana and it seemed really pricey). Wait was also nonexistent for sushi at the bar. \n\nAnother disclaimer: I'm used to California sushi restaurants & chains (Japanese friends would have MUCH higher standards) and I haven't had good sushi since I've moved out to DC.\n\nFriend & I shared: Pittsburgh Penguins Roll (when in Pittsburgh...), Spicy Squid Salad, Salmon Ceviche (cannot find on online menu), and Philadelphia roll (because somehow my friend has NEVER had it?)\n\nEverything was really good! I especially liked the spicy squid salad and the salmon ceviche- the latter had pretty thick pieces of salmon but was so nicely presented that I didn't really mind at all (the same cannot be said for everyone.) \n\nOverall: good, solid Japanese restaurant. Would go again."
"It's not healthy, and they aren't trying to hide it. The ice cream is actually quite superb. Loses 1 star for the usually dismal service, amount of eye rolling and just general lack of caring by staff. I'm not sure if this a managerial problem, but many times the place will be PACKED and you will have one person tending to customers, and the other one will be making ice cream sandwiches or something equivalently unnecessary (when you can see a refrigerator full of sandwiches that are not being eaten). You can ask to try the ice creams, but don't expect them to be happy about it. \n\nI've taken to not getting ice cream anymore and ordering the chocolate covered frozen banana. It's still really tasty and I assume a little bit healthier?"
"Do not go there if you have a late afternoon client meeting.  You will be happy, but you will be oh so sleepy.  What I love about LoLo's is that they have the best lunch combinations already figured out for you....the hard part is just picking out which one.  The macaroni and cheese is just the type you want, gooey and cheesy.  The collard greens are tender with just a little bitterness and the chicken is without compare.  I care mostly about the waffles which are huge and the size of a dinner plate.  Oh and you can get red kool-aide in mason jars.  Need I say more?"
"Excelent...\n\n     I recently moved to this area and needed quality service to take care of my beat up runners feet. I tried numerous places in the Charlotte area and no one can compete with this place. \n     My girlfriend has been going here since she was in high school (almost 15 years) and kept telling me to go. The staff is very friendly, efficient, and most important, consistent with their level of service. I was surprised to be greeted with my first name after only 2 visits. Very pleased all around. Sometimes the wait can be a bit lengthy but trust me, as with anything great, it is worth the wait and there is a reason that the line is long. \n     Overall, it is a must for anyone looking for quality service. I go for the pedis but my girlfriend visits at least once a month for eyebrow waxing, gel manis, and even tanning. 5 stars all the way.!.!."
I unfortunately had to use their service recently and was very please with their work.  The job was done timely and it looked perfect except for one flaw which I pointed out and they immediately corrected it.  I had to wait an extra half hour for the correction and I was on my way.\nThey provided a good car rental from Enterprise and had my car for about a week.\nThe estimate was quite a bit lower than the final price which I was a little disappointed with.  I really think it should have been much closer to the actual cost.  It was all covered by insurance though so that was good.  \nEveryone was very friendly and helpful.
"I, for one, have spent way too much time in Wando's...drowning in fish bowls, consuming free bacon on Tuesdays (with $1 PBR's, natch), and generally overindulging myself. This is all in my college years. However, even when I get back to Madison once per year, I still make a stop at Wando's. Why?\n\n1) To reminisce about the above. It's still the same bar but now there are heat lamps outside when you wait in a long line. \n\n2) Fish bowls. One sip will probably do now. Those things are lethal and will leave you with the worst.hangover.ever. \n\n3) Cheap drinks. Although you can likely get these anywhere. \n\nThe bartenders range from polite to surly and the crowd can completely vary, mostly depending on game nights. It's a bar, not a country club."
"This place is hit and miss, but when its good its REALLY good."
"This Hampton Inn is a perfectly fine place to stay. The beds are comfortable and clean (they are really adamant that they wash the duvet as well as the sheets), the shower adequate and the wi-fi free and not painfully slow. All of this at an extremely reasonable rate, AND they throw in a free breakfast. That's a good deal.\n\nMy only serious issue, one for which I almost deducted a star, is that they are sexist. Maybe not the staff (who were all extremely courteous), but the toilets are clearly biased against men. It was literally impossible to leave the seat up, which I discovered when it slammed down and nearly made me a woman myself. \n\nAs someone who likes to multitask and brush my teeth as I go #1, this inconvenience cost me at least 30 seconds every morning I stayed here. And quite frankly, it's unacceptable."
"I was really apprehensive to try LoLo's again after the big overhaul... afraid that it would lose the quality and charm that made it something special... Boy was I wrong!!!\n\nThe food is amazing.  Fried chicken perfectly seasoned, juicy and crispy! Mac & chee, waffles, green beans all cooked to southern perfection! \n\nA giant mason jar of blue kool-aid is the ultimate accompaniment  in my opinion, but they now have a wide range of alcoholic bevvies to wet your whistle if you prefer.\n\nChef Nicky stopped by our table twice to personally ask us about how we enjoyed our food - nice touch!  (And this is just one example of the spectacular service that we experienced the entire time we were at LoLo's!)\n\nThis place is rockin! I can't wait to show it off to out of town guests and local friends alike!"
"""I'm surprised by eljoi's comments.

"It pains me to write this review. I am afraid that more people will find out about Brian - making it more difficult for me to make an appointment with him.\n\nWith a slightly weird textured hair (imagine a chia pet head with cowlicks), I had always resorted to a very short hairstyle. After being chastised by my wife for perpetually sporting the army recruit look, I presented Brian with the monstrosity that is my hair.\n\nAfter 8 visits, I am happy to report that for the first time in my life, I have a medium-length haircut that is both easy to style and professional. \n\nBrian is a perfectionist. He listens well, takes his time, and is talented with both clippers and scissors. I wish I had found him earlier. \n\nFront desk staff has always been professional and makes you feel welcome. All of the 8 appointments were met with little to no wait. I am just glad that after 12 months of searching, I stumbled across this salon."
"Food: 5\nDecor: 3\nService: 2\n\nAmazing food, but service was disappointing. I came here around 6:30pm for dinner on Monday night.\n\n1. Chicken Shawarma, 13 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bJo_-dEqQKdJKQJaa9hK7g?select=p5dWwxJ2w5m3sKThQ6lAAA\nDelicious, definitely one of the best Mediterranean I've had. The chicken was nice and moist, and the plate came with a ridiculous amount of hummus. Paired with hot, fresh bread http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bJo_-dEqQKdJKQJaa9hK7g?userid=2fN8mN7uUjOw-QqtcgYqXQ, and this dish overall was amazing. I almost opted for the chicken kabobs, but the server recommended this instead.\n\nService was extremely slow. I had to request fresh bread from another server, and it took two tries before I got my check. Then it took forever to pick up my check."
"I think Ulta is taking over my preferred place to get makeup stuff over Sephora for the most part. Ulta has sales, coupons, etc. and a rewards program that makes it worth it to shop. SAs did approach to see if I needed help and when I did they are generally pretty helpful. I normally like to browse alone and they aren't pushy. \n\nThe one thing about this place is how strongly the fragrance smells in here. I don't know what it is about this location but it is really bad. I'm normally not afflicted but it was bothersome and the BF got instant headache. I don't know if it's because we come on weekends when it's busy and a lot of assholes like the spray the air to smell, but it may be too much for a sensitive person. \n\nStill, I am a fan and I say it's a go for beauty stuff."
"I've been here a trillion times. Ok jk, I'm here a lot. At least once a week. So by now, I've pretty much had my order prepared and organized. They ask a series of standard questions: what kind of bagel? Did you want that toasted? What kind of side? What's your name? Is it for here or to-go?\n\nSo I come in and I order one or the other:\n1. Tasty turkey on asiago not toasted, side of potato salad for here. I love that their sandwiches come with alfalfa sprouts. Really, I get bummed when they're out. That's the cherry on top. \n\n(or)2. Cheese and herb bagel with a side of chicken soup. Their cheese bagel is so yummy when it's delivered. But the soup is never consistent. It's either really hot the way I like any soup, or less hot than the cheese bagel which only makes it awkward."
"Normally, I don't rate food court spots. It's food court pizza, pasta and salad. So don't expect more than that. What made Villa pizza stand out was the exceptional service provided. 5 stars for the young man who went out of his way to make my family and I feel important. :)"
"The guys here do a fantastic job, I had to get my brakes checked so I went there, they checked them out and let me know that one of my front pads needed changing and the other was close. They even showed me how they were wearing down.  I have been to other places and the try to rake you over the coals but they were professional and got it done quick. I would definitely use them again."
"Great store. Very clean and organized. But the prices can be a little crazy. Almost retail. Very good quality clothing . They never have any sales days. If you are not a huge fan of thrifts this could be the place for you. Plus sizes are separated , but regular sizes are all mixed up. No dressing room and no exchanges/refunds. Lots of brand new clothing with tags."
"Staff is very respectful and the place is quiet. Been going here from referrals from UNLV whenever needed. Wait times can become long, but what can you expect? They do walk-ins, and all my visits have been for an x-Ray. Zach, the technologist does his job very well and they even give your images back on a disc in a hurry."
"Think bright yellow and orange booths, daisy light fixtures hanging overhead, and trival pursuit cards on each table to play while waiting on your food.  It's a throw back to 1970's, all that was missing was shag carpeting!\n\nNow what about the food? Simple, straight foward, right from your Momma's kitchen.  My choice today, country breakfast, scrambled, two sauage patties choice of potato and biscuit with milk gravy!\n\nVery good, simple, nothing fancy. Cooked well, gravy is thick, with bits of sauage and and seasoned, reminds me of the South!\n\nOverall, good service, simple food and price is right!"
My picture was taken here. Four stars just for the mini-chimis and the patty melt.
"Finally came back during peak lunch time instead of 3 pm and figured it out.  I usually headed straight to the bar which is full-service, but for everyone else it is counter service.  All the more reason to sit at the bar!"
Chicken is really really good; I must say.  NOT GREASY and probably because of the type of oil used. Price's only take CASH and condiments are extra.
"I'm not big on coffee shops, but if I lived by this one I could possibly change my tune.\n\nThe sandwiches were good (ended up there twice...once in the afternoon for lunch sandwiches and once for breakfast sandwiches) and I also enjoyed how they all ended up being flat when heated.  Self-service water cooler by the coffee fixins was also a plus in my book.\n\nBonus - not only do they have free wi-fi, but they also have 1 computer for customer use.  So if you happen to be in Madison and on a Sunday morning and don't have a laptop and need to change your fantasy football lineup, this place makes it happen."
"""This is the very first place I tried when I started eating at what I considered to be an \""""upscale\"""" restaurant at the time.

So far I've tried the blackened ribeye (my favorite), the lamb chops, and the filet Mignon. \n\nMy wife always orders the blackened ribeye. I think she's trying to figure out who in Vegas has the best ribeye. So far T-Bone's Chophouse holds that title.\n\nGuys, if you've never taken your girl out to a really nice restaurant to eat and you think Olive Garden is upscale, try this place out. Its a guaranteed step up and will earn you a bunch of cool points.\n\nIf you eat out regularly and haven't been here yet, check it out because they have an awesome menu and its not too pricey compared to some of the nicer restaurants we've eaten at."""
"well, we went there at 10pm on a friday and the place was starkly empty.\n\nsome burley men were creating a dance floor by clearing the place of its furniture. so we expected a party of reveling dancers to come in (there were like 2 latino men at the bar, so we thought it was like an underground durangeno dance hall on friday nights. incorrect.)\n\nanyway, 1.5 hours later, no one had come in and the burley men replaced all the furniture. no dance party at all! sad news!\n\nanyway, we just drank a lot at the empty bar at the side of the restaurant. who can really complain.\n\nas usual, it was nearly free to drink alcohol. i had two literal tankers of red bull and vodka for like 3 dollars each.\n\nit seemed like the bartenders didnt want us to be there and kind of ignored us but i guess that made it harder to black out, which is a good thing for everyone."
"Yelpers saved the day!  got home last night and the heater was not working. found reviews for Dekes here on Yelp and gave them a call. Said their guy was on a call but would come here next.

"Skip the mac & cheese here unless you like bland kraft-style.  Super disappointing!  However, the blackened flounder tacos were tasty!"
"This might be the best dive bar ever! Used to go here all the time from 2000 - 2002, cause of the $3 pitchers, now i can only make it back every few months :(  Scott is right about the smoke, but with the AZ smoking ban it is no longer an issue. The bar is roughly the size of a large living room with a pool table, darts, real bathrooms, and 2 tvs. Cant remember how much the pitchers are now, but last time i got totally plowed and spent like $20. Crowd is hit or miss, but always friendly. Sometime its all regulars, sometime there are some attractive younger singles in there.. just depends. If your trying to find the place, don't get confused. Its wedged back in the corner of a shopping center, the door of which does not face the street."
"Ok, so maybe it's because I have a little bit of status with US Airways that I'm biased for and lately, their planes that I have been on have been newer (albeit typically smaller planes than some airlines).  The staff has always been professional and friendly in my dealing with them. So, for me to be a happy camper, I just need newer planes, friendly staff, and good connections. They give me that."
"The Bikini Lounge is a terrific dive bar, attracting mostly hipsters, bar-o-sauruses, sometimes bums and/or your occasional tweaker, and some slumin-it douches.  Honestly I liked it a little more before the smoking ban (seemed to have more ambiance) but it still is a good place for some cheap drinking.  What are you gonna do?  Times change.  Apparently some folks reviewing here didn't see the part about Bikini being a DIVE bar.  Yep, so don't expect this to be some neat clean place with where all of the beautiful people go and security guards watch your car in the parking lot.  It is what it is as others have said.\n\nEdit:  I have now realized that it has lost something - its dimness.  There is a huge light near the ceiling that, um, just makes it too well lighted.  Bring back my dark tiki bar!"
"Sushi was great, I had the Bonzai, the sauce was amazing, however the staff was a bit standoffish and the tea was terrible, I've also never been charged for tea before, so that was new, other than that i really liked it. I might go back, if only for the amazing Bomba dessert i got,"
"I'm seeing a lot of complaints about service, but my experience with the drive-thru here has just about always been efficient and pleasant. (Of course, any task that ends in eating a hamburger probably gets graded on a curve for me.)\n\nThis is a good spot to pick up a quick lunch as you pass through the South Side...even if the dark pass-through where you grab your food kind of makes it feel like you're en route to a drug deal."
"I know I should let Dominic Review this but.....\n\nGreat place from a girls point of view.\nNice fun waiting area. Kinda casual sophisticated. Friendly staff, minus the blond receptionist that took pictures of herself while we were there. Dom got a cut and a hot towel, oh yeah and a beer. \n\nThey offer drinks and he didn't pay anything extra.\n\nThere was an empty chair and the gal let me and Lennon sit and chat while she was cutting. Big salons have a frown for having your company sit and wait. \n\nSorry for getting girl all over your manly barber place. \nYou probably will see us there again, I have recommended it to many guys already.\nand yes I nursed there.\n\nWe walked there on a Thursday afternoon. Me Dom and Lennon."
"I'd like to note this place is pretty pricey. Their prepared meals are great, but I find it impossible for me to spend $3.99 for a yellow pepper organic or not when they are 99 cents to 1.19 at the famer's market."
"I got my front brake pads + rotors replaced for $325. It was quick, painless, and reasonably priced. They have complimentary wifi if you are going to sit in the shop and do work (like I did).\n\nDO visit their website for coupons. I didn't and I feel like a dummy."
"""Apparently I've stayed away from chains a little too long, because I didn't realize what I was missing. \""""gave-in\"""" if you will on a trip and agreed to eat at a major chain restaurant (which I rarely, if ever, do). Wow, was I surprised. The chips came out hot and well salted, the service was prompt, courteous, and actually quite enjoyable. The menu isn't your boring fake Mexican food and had plenty of both traditional, healthy, and gourmet options. Since I was in a \""""give it a shot\"""" mood, we sampled the ultimate loaded queso and could really have made a meal out of that. Not your typical white cheese boring, this conglomerate of cheese, refried beans, guac, beef, sour cream, and deliciousness was very tasty. For the entree, opted for the enchilada trio and was in heaven with the barbacoa, green-chili chicken, and sour cream version. Also sampled some of the tamales and while non-traditional, had a great flavor and the pork was very tender.\n\nI don't normally say this, but this is one chain I wouldn't mind giving repeat business too! (and already have once before I could write this)"""
"Pork chop plate: YUM! Comes with a mound of rice with some sort of sauce on top, a hard boiled egg, and tasty pickled cabbage and carrots. $8 cheapest thing we ordered and best thing we had\n\nTaiwanese chunk chicken: gingery, star anise-y, Chinese 5-spice-ish. Not spicy at all. Decent. Comes out sizzling. Not worth $13 IMO.\n\nMapo Bean Curd: this is my usual pick for Chinese/Taiwanese restos. Huge portion but meh. This is usually spicy! Why y'all holdin out on spice??? Cost $10 I think.\n\nThe last page of the menu has a list of personal dishes and are super cheap for the amount of food you get.\n\nFAST and friendly service. Tiny restaurant, hard to find parking."
"I used to go to the Steak and Hoagie / Grekos at Sharon Amity and Monroe until they closed due to road construction 2 years ago. I had seen the one on Eastway but its not the greatest part of town and about 5 miles from my business. Today it popped into my head and myself and 5 coworkers decided to try it. This place is going on the lunch rotation! Rotisserie Chicken - awesome, Greek salad- excellent, roasted potatoes- greasy and delicious. According to coworkers the chicken parm sandwich and cheesesteak were also good as was the Grecian chicken. They didn't have the Teriyaki chicken today but if my memory serves me it was fantastic. The prices are from 1995. 1/4 Chicken 2 sides and garlic bread $5.85. Great food, large portions, very reasonable price."
"Walkers really does care about what is happening at their store. I got a call from them after my disappointing trip there. They made arrangements for me to come in and correct the problem, they even discounted another table so I could be happy. Very good customer service from a company that apparently cares for its customers. My hats off to all at Walkers."
We've taken our pets to Fitchburg Veterinary for years. My dog has a lot of anxiety and fear when going to the vet (from a different vet) and Dr. Lukas and all the staff there always understanding and try to put him at ease. We are always able to get in for an appointment quickly and the staff there is friendly and helpful.
"I usually wait to see movies at the 1.50 theater.  Eight dollars isn't worth it, just have patience.  There are a lot of wild cats in this place though; I witnessed a family bring in an entire KFC family meal and grub down during the show.  That was outright hilarious!  \n\nAll of the box office hits come here, and I am going to check out the Dark Knight again when it leaves the mainstream theater.  If you get upset over loud laughter and the occasional outburst, just leave this theater alone.  I think it all adds to the fun."
"I've been going to Akropolis since it was put into the Arboretum.  \n\nThe atmosphere has never been much to write home about.  They close a week or two out of the year to usually clean/repaint the place but it always meets south of expectation.  The tables are loud, the chairs they use heavy as anything and louder still.  The service is usually wage (or sub) high school students and you know how that can go.  That's not what it's about though.. it is the food right?\n\nI think they have the best gyro meat in town.  While it's not like leaving the country and having lamb/steak on a spit it is served fresh and well spiced.  Others in town that you get gyros from will serve you some Cisco food service derivative which is freaky.  Their Chicken and kabobs are also juicy and never dry.\n\nYou could rank a lot of complaints on this place if you weren't careful but I've been to them long enough and a repeat customer for probably 15+ years and they continually draw me back a few times a month."
"The four stars is for the smell. Don't make the same mistake as me and expect them to sell from the location that's marked on the map.\nA little mad, yes. I drove down there and smelled some awesome bread-y smells but was turned away at the door. Sorry we don't sell direct to the public the guy says. I felt a small part of me die inside.\nSoooo still have yet to taste any but from the smell I can assume it's pretty damn good."
The food is not that bad considering it is Chuck E Cheese and I must say it is always clean or being cleaned for the amount of kids that are always there. I wish it was a little less packed. Its almost too packed. I might try the one near the Grand Canyon Plaza and 215. Our kids always have a great time and I love that they serve Gluten Free Food (the reason for my 4 star rating). That is VERY thoughtful of them. It would be nice if they also had organic options but I may be pushing it.
"I stop here every Monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in Mexican comfort food. My wife swears by the carne asado tacos; the cheese enchiladas ring my bell. Although I phone in my order, the parking lot is always an adventure. However, the one night a young Hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurant's limited outdoor sitting area insisted I come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients."
"What a cool store! When my husband said he had to go to the hobby shop, I picture the hobby shops I remember (smell of superglue and aisles of things I'm not sure what's done with them), and went with him kicking and screaming. But I left there pleasantly surprised. I even almost bought something. But I was afraid it would become like most of my craft ideas and sit on a shelf unopened.  There was the typical hobby shop nerdy stuff like RC and model cars. But they also had games, mold making kits (my mind goes to jewelry), trains, and so much more. It's a small cramped store especially when it's busy, but it's nicely organized and the staff was very friendly. Not sure how prices were since I don't frequent these places but they seemed reasonable enough."
"Good food and a pretty good selection of groceries. Sometimes the food is a little too dry, and some would say that it is too expensive, but I like it.\n\nThere is a $10 minimum on credit cards, which sucks if you just want dinner or something, but you can always buy a dozen feta and spinach rolls....MMMmmmmm"
"I'm ashamed to say tonight was my first trip to joyful house. I've heard a dozen times that it is the best Chinese food in Las Vegas and my husband is Chinese but I never went!\n\nWell, it lived up to the rave reviews. The food was excellent. Zero complaints. Even the service, which generally leaves much to be desired at Chinese places, was friendly and attentive. \n\nWe ordered the salt and pepper calamari, beef chow fun, Mongolian beef, and spicy string beans with minced pork. The calamari was perfection. Nuf said. Ooh and a surprise of crispy jalape\u00f1os were mixed in. The string beans were flavorful, fresh, and crisp. The Mongolian beef melted in your mouth. Not a single hint of the tough, chewy, overcooked beef you may have encountered elsewhere. \n\nNo culinary surprises here. Classic Chinese cuisine done right. Really right."
"Unfortunately, they're CLOSED.\n\nI shopped there as a Davidson student in the 1970's. I bought tons of AV gear there (cameras, dissolve units, slide projectors, lenses, cases, etc.) when I was a producer of multi-image in the 1980s. \n\nI miss those folks. They were professionals and specialists --- in every sense of the words."
I think I have been in love with JJ's since I was around 19... I used to swear up and down their bread had crack in it since it was so addicting. I was there a couple of days ago though and was saddened that the turkey tom no longer had alfalfa in it bc of the constant problem with alfalfa recalls. Damn e. coli I tell  ya! Gets you every time.  Go for the bread. And the mayo.
"Good brunch except the main course, very dry croque Madame, they made up for it with a free dessert"
"It must be Sunday, that's the day my husband and I usually eat dim sum.  Today, we are trying Cathay house, haven't been here in a while and our usually haunt is very busy, so we took a chance and thought we might be faster getting in here and we were right, got seated right away and the food carts came rolling up.\n\nThe selection at first seem vast and our table was soon covered with the little plates, bamboo baskets and bowls of steamed goodies.  But by the time I got to my third choice it was very similar to the last, it seems we had choose almost all shrimp and they were beginning to taste the same. \n\nAlthough everything was fresh and service was great, it seem to me that it all tasted the same and I was disappointed in the end."
"Having spent two years in Columbia, a city devoid of excellent falafel, it warmed the cockles of my heart to find rich, green, moist falafel at Kabob Grill.  I had a vegetarian sampler which was good but not terribly memorable, save for the falafel.  My husband, however, had a lentil and caramelized onion dish that was really great.\n\nWe were there on a Friday night (at the Dilworth location), and the belly dancer was incredibly distracting, particularly since we were hungry.  We had difficulty concentrating on anything else.  It's a small restaurant, which resulted in the whole experience of having bangled ass shaken in our faces.  To her credit, the young lady who danced was lovely and talented, but I just wanted to eat."
"You know how hard it is to find a good automotive shop in this town, or anywhere?\n\nHow about an EPIC shop that has been here for decades? That would be Dan's Driveline. These guys are absolutely awesome.\n\nI bought an old 87 F-150 as a project truck a couple years ago with almost 300K miles on her so needless alot of work was comin.\n\nI have had these guys re-do her entire drive-train piece by piece and NO_ONE can do what they do, how they do. Re-sealed both differentials, replaced all U-Joints front and rear, pinion seals, rebuilt the transmission, and more. Most of the time these guys are done ahead of schedule. \n\nSo if you have anything drivetrain related or even brake jobs call the guys, ask for Brick."
"I really wish more people would come here and go to places other than Le's Sandwiches.  Don't get me wrong I love Le's, but there are some other businesses in here that are in need of some business so that the mall can clean itself up.  I gave it a 4 star because I enjoy the food and the grocery store inside, but it should be around a 2 or 3 based on the condition of the place in general.  The two main places I like in here are the Hong Kong BBQ and Le's, but I have hit up the dim sum place once and have enjoyed it.  Gone on in *during the day* and walk around and go in.  They are very willing to help you have some good food you just have to ask."
"I have to give Cabo 4 stars because of my husband. He doesn't yelp, but this is hands down his favorite place. If I'm out of town- he will go here repeatedly. I'm not as impressed.\n\nCabo started in Blacksburg. Anyone else notice the high number of Hokies that live in the Charlotte area? \n\nThe inside is really nice. I like the d\u00e9cor. They renovated the building and did a great job. There is a little patio. \n\nI usually get the Lemon Grass Shrimp tacos. I like the mexi-slaw as the side. They have an INCREDIBLE corn chowder- but it isn't always on the menu. Order it if you see it.\n\nMy husband loves almost everything on the menu and always raves about it. BTW- this place can get PACKED. This is NOT a smart place to go to with a big group."
"Right now, thru 9/3/12 if u go to Sbux in the AM, you can get your afternoon pick me  up for $2.  So for anyone who is healing, since you will definitely be more tired, exhausted & overwrought, I look at this as akin to meditation, brain games, memory improvement or therapy.  The benefits of coffee are known & studied so it's not going to be unbeneficial.  Plus it's at a discount."
"Why should the bad economy take the fun out of lingerie shopping? It shouldn't. If buying an adorable teddy or thong boosts your spirits, IC London will make you a very happy girl. A message for the boys: buying your sweetie a nighty or some naughty-but-nice undie ensemble will earn serious props this Valentine's Day. \n\nAnd the staff here are friendly, laid-back and helpful. Sort of like your cool big sis. Unless you're a undergarment shopper with a seriously wild streak, put your prurient fantasies aside and shop here. You'll feel good about it, your honey will think you have classy taste, and you'll enjoy the benefits of wearing  (or admiring) well-made, beautiful lingerie."
"I love the food. This place is awesome. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I don't like being nickled and dimed to death. C'mon, just give me the toppings without a surcharge!!"
"BEST SHEPHERD'S PIE I'VE EVER HAD!\n\nService was slow because there was just one waiter to serve the full house. He was so nice, I felt bad for him! We will definitely be returning, great environment, they don't skimp on the alcohol, and I now have a constant aching for the shepherd's pie!"
"""An old-school off-the-strip joint with tons of omelets including the \""""Kitchen Sink\"""": they throw everything in it and hope it works.  Highlight: Pumpkin nut bread"""
"I went here to get some carrot oil and olive oil for my hair. They had a lot of stuff, while some shelves were bare. The staff was decent and helpful. The area doesn't look so hot, but I don't live anywhere near it, so I don't care. Overall I think I'll return."

"""For some I assume this would be a grand experience. My guess is that it would be for the same people who would label this as a \""""Soul Food\"""" restaurant. In my home however, it is simply food. Regular old, Sunday night  food. Good food: absolutely. Exceptional food: nah. \n\nMaybe this is because  the mac and cheese and fried chicken taste exactly the same as what I place on my table for family get-togethers. However, if it is food that you do not know how to cook on your own I would suspect that you'd find it delightful. \n\nPros: mac & cheese and fried chicken are very good. Homefries are to die for. Good service and drinks are served in jars (gotta love that).\n\nCons: You have to wait in the blistering heat to be seated, the place is extremely small and don't be fooled by the Famous red velvet cake. It taste like red cornbread with icing and walnuts. Very good icing and walnuts but all the same just a spiced up cornbread.\n\nOverall: Good experience. Good food and yes if I head out of Cali to Phoenix again I will go back."""
"""I've had lots of questions about job placement following up my first review. They don't really do job placement like you might hope. They just list places that have openings or potential openings.\n\nYour best bet is to just hound and apply like crazy to any bar back/bar apprentice position you can. A LOT of casinos don't consider Bartending Certification real training. However if you study and keep up on your knowledge, you'll be fine. \n\nI've been to places where they said, \""""Bartending training, huh?

Otherwise...jobs are incredibly difficult to come by. 2 years later and I still haven't found a bar position!"""
"Great place. Came in with a flat tire, bent wheel, and two bent rims. Within ten minutes they rotated the tires, put a brand new one on, fixed the wheel and both rims, and had us out the door. $90 for everything and nice, chill, professional service. Highly recommended."
"Nice sized portion for lunch, not too big but enough for the price.  Great flavors and yummy hummus.  The pita bread was a let down, just a notch above grocery store pita and only then 'cause I didn't have to go to the store and buy it.  Service was fast but not outstanding, probably because the waiter struggled with English.  We'll eat here again when we're in the area but we won't make a special trip."
"I have left well rested and satisfied. After all flights in the northeast got canceled due to snow storms it was a mad scramble to find a clean and decent room that wasn't some sketchy motel and with shuttle service to/from the airport. After calling around to all the Hilton's, Hyatt's, Sheraton's and Marriott's with no luck, I felt very lucky to have found the last room here but was a bit apprehensive as i had no idea what to expect having never stayed at a La Quinta.  What i found was exactly what i needed after all the airport chaos,  friendly staff, a clean and quiet room that was well lit, spacious, free wireless, late night food delivery options and most importantly a clean bed and shower.  They have the basics done right."
"Okay, so I don't really have much to say about this place since I've only done the cafe/pastry service. But if that's just a taste of what the rest of restaurant is, then the restaurant is probably very very good.  Think buttery pastries that are always flaky and never greasy. My favorite is the smoked salmon croissant--creamy, just a bit salty, all encased in a wonderful flaky crust. Think fancy-ass Hot Pocket.\n\nA note about the drinks. DO NOT GET LEMONADE to go. EVER. I did that today, and it cost just a little less than my croissant. I was surprised to learn that my drink was 3.25, but then I went to their website and learned they do free lemonade refills. Which is great if you're eating in, but sucks if you're taking out."
"Open 10:30 to 2:30, so lunch is your only option here.   I would bet this place is really busy during lunch time, because I was here at 10:45 and there was already steady traffic coming in.    \n\nMmmm Japanese food.  I had the Kobe beef bowl, and spicy shrimp rolls.  The Kobe was better than I expected for 6 bucks, and I really liked the spicy shrimp rolls, kind of on the small side but fresh and just spicy enough.   The menu looks pretty good from the pictures on the wall so I'll go back and try a few more items when I get a chance and don't see a line out the door."
A Great bar!!!  The only problem is there is no coat check.
$19.99 for a pair of VH flat front slacks! you cant beat that! all different colors and sizes for my man to look great. Steer clear of pleated pants b/c let me tell you from a woman's POV - NOBODY looks good in pleated pants.. just sayin. \n\ni saw a scarf i really really wanted but it was $50... conveniently marked up so that the 50% off makes you think you're getting a deal. What the hell ever. Yes this location is in the LV Premium outlets but I'm not stupid- that my dear is not a deal. I left the scarf there b/c lets face it- that too only looks cute on flat chested girls.. on ladies like me it just adds bulk... and I have my own bulk that I dont need to add on to it.. thanks. \nwhich way is the Coach store? ...

"So I recently moved to Madison and was looking for a dentist. One of my PPO providers happened to be Midwest Dental. I went online and, honestly, was very skeptical about going to this place after reading some of the horrible reviews. In any event, I decided to give it a shot. And I must say, Dr. Ena Lee is a wonderful dentist! She explains everything and gives you options and suggestions. Becky and her are such great team. They always talk about fun stuff while working on my teeth. It is such a good distraction. This is the first time IN MY LIFE that I actually do not mind going to a dentist. These guys are simply awesome!"
"I have a dream, that one day I will get the right drink.  The time before last, I ordered a large coffee which came in a bucket size cup.   It was 110 degrees outside and the hot drink made me sweat like a marathon runner on his/her last mile.    This last time, I ordered a strawberry drink that was so sweet that if I added 1/2 cup of sugar, it would taste no different.   However, aside from my bad selections, my friend's drinks were great and the mango ice was refereshing.   So I cannot mark it down for my bad choices.  I will continue with my dream to order accordingly and will soon return.   By the way, do not order the plum/grass ice, it taste as good as it sounds."
Yelp is showing this place as being in the North Hills but it's actually located in Homestead: 135 E 8th Ave!!

"Really have to rate them top notch.  Wanted a water softner so gave them a call, a few days later John came out and helped me figure out what I needed.  Installed the soft water conditioner and discovered my plumming was screwed up was getting soft water everywhere, sprinkler, pool, kitchen sink.  Had to reschedule to get my plumming done right.   few dats later and after a few hours of replumming John gogt it right.  Everytime they came to the house they ensured I was more than satisfied.  I am happy with the work and will use them again if needed, they have my recommendation if anyone asks."
"If only there was another location on the east side.  \nThere are a lot of custard shops in my area but I don't think twice about driving all the way to the west side for some of this yogurt.  \nThey have many different flavors and have always let me sample ones before I make my decision.  \nThey have alot of topping to choose from and you can also have the same kinds of dishes that you are used to with custard.  Sundaes, parfaits, banana splits, to name a few.  They also have smoothies and other things advertised that I haven't had the chance to try, but have no doubts that they are good.\nThey have something for everyone and its basically guilt free!!"
"I was referred to Ed for an AC compressor+condenser change by another highly rated mechanic on yelp last year. He did a great job and saved me about $400. About 2 weeks ago, my car was involved in a collision and was deemed a total loss by the insurance company. Even though the service was done almost a year ago, Ed was most kind and provided a copy of my original receipt to the insurance company. If you are looking for a trustworthy mechanic who can get the job done, Ed is the person you want to go to."
"I've taken an interest in my front yard. I never have before, but recently I was motivated to do so by my parents. I actually reside in my parents' home; my husband, brother, and I. I noted the lawn was quite.... burnt and yellow. Now, it is Vegas so not really surprising. However, it came to me one day that I wanted the lawn to look nice!\n\nAfter going to my nearest Home Depot and not finding anything I wanted I decided to come to Lowes. I looked online to see if Lowes had what I wanted (an aerator), but no. They did not have it. I opted for another tool which would do pretty much the same thing. I got fertilizer and gardening gloves.\n\nMy husband and I were not helped by any associates, but I liked Lowes better than HD. The gardening center was more shaded and less hot. There seemed to be a better selection of flowers. \n\nI'll be back to this Lowes for some pots for plants to put in my front yard when my grass becomes green. At least, I really, really hope the grass starts becoming green."

"I'm so torn as I write this review.  The atmosphere and service is unparalleled. The sweetest, cutest servers with really excellent attitudes make me want to come back, and the '50s style motif is very cool. The manager came over to see how we were doing and he was very interested to know if we were happy with everything. But...I wasn't totally satisfied. The ice cream was great - nice and creamy and real.  We split the pippen Jolly Green Giant and when it came out we were a bit underwhelmed. They made it seem to grandiose, and it was just...eh. Regular mint choco chip ice cream with some mini choco chips sprinkled on top. My mom had the Cafe Ole and loved it. My papa had a sundae with caramel sauce and loved it. It did seem a bit overpriced, but the experience was worth it."
Dr Cooper and his staff are fabulous.  They have been so supportive and compassionate. I have been going to Dr. Cooper since moving here to Charlotte 6yrs ago. and I have to say. This has been the worst week ever experienced with two of my dogs having both eye trauma and being horribly sick.  They are doing everything they can for us and making sure that I know what is going on and how they are doing. Thank you so much Dr. Cooper for all that you do.
"The only reason I come here is for TONY! He is amazing at acrylics, I'm so rough on mine and my hands are always in water and have chemicals on them because I'm a hair dresser but they never break, lift or chip.

"My first ever fish taco, and it blew my mind. \n\nFirst walking in, I thought the atmosphere was meh (too loud) and the service was also meh (too slow). The salsa was pretty good but nothing unlike the salsas I've had before. \n\nBut then my BBQ Mahi Tuna Taco came and I almost died and went to heaven. I was expecting fish tasting taco but it was the least fish tasting tuna I've ever had. The fish was cut into chunky cubes but cooked so the meat practically melted into your mouth. The best part was the tortilla.  The tortilla was made out of some sort of God-Bread that was both flaky and bready at the same time. It was almost pastry like and I need to know how to make it! \n\nBut anyways. You get my drift. Awesome, awesome, awesome food."
"I like Brats a lot for watching sports/hanging out with friends. The bartenders are pros and they make a pretty decent bloody mary (my general standard for bar quality). I wish the food was better though. Brats is not known for their food, so I didn't have high expectations, but even so I was pretty bummed about my dry, flavorless burger. My friends assure me, however that you can't go wrong with the chicken tenders, so I guess we'll see for next time."
"great pizza, cold beer.great place, those whiners with the 1 star should really stfu. For christ's sake, its vegas, you can smoke in church here ok?"
"""This Big Dog's carries the Big Dog brewed rootbeer. So if you like rootbeer they have it.\n\nHowever there menu is overpriced, but not so much when they run their whole, buy $75 on a gift card get $25 back, and also get on their reward plan so you get fatty discounts. \n\nYeah, it's on north nellis, and the surrounding area isn't very \""""pretty\"""" but that's my eastside ghetto I live in and I love it! Real cities are like that and at least this part of Vegas has the best rootbeer in Nevada, dare I say the US!\n\nThe happy hour chicken wings during NFL football are my favorite with bbq sauce $5 for about a dozen...Damn I want some now! \n\nAlso the major company does these beer tasting events which I want to go to but have no one to go with. So I think it's a hell of a place. But I am biased by the inhouse brewed rootbeer!"""
"i'm no expert on fried chicken being from new york city, but oh my Lord.  That is some good chicken.  The spices that are included in the chicken and the pockets of juice that are formed after your first bite? Love it, it's addicting and I am so sad that my project in charlotte is ending next week!"
"Having heard several accounts of not-so-pleasant staff, I just had to come here and check it out for myself.  When I walked in I was greeted with the sight of lovely colors and huge quantities of yarn everywhere.\n\nI wandered around a bit looking at and touching a lot of the yarn and taking it all in.  When I spent a while at the cotton section a staff member came up and asked if I needed help with anything.  I told her I was just browsing and she went back to the front room.  I ended up buying a skein of cotton yarn and the same woman rang me up without any unpleasantness.\n\nI did not get a chance to try anything from the coffee shop in the back of the store but the staff back there looked friendly and the coffee smell was heavenly.\n\nSince this place is so close by I will definitely be going again for future yarn needs."
"A dead institution, while it was alive I loved Kazansky's.  Insanely cheap breakfast (Challah french toast was $4 with a bowl of FRUIT).  Sandwiches were hit or miss, but the soups were out of this world.  The fries here were, somehow, incredible.  The Rachel couldn't be beaten.  The service was always spotty, an psuedo gang bangers were allowed to pace the floor of the restaurant, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.  Sadly, Pittsburgh no longer has a Jewish deli."
Looking for a tuxedo shirt? Maybe an apron that looks like a fat Elvis? No? How about some playing cards or key chains? This place has EVERY souvenir you can possibly think of and more!
"""Downgrading slightly based on past few visits, where flavors have been \""""off.\"""" Most recently, had the artichoke omelet and was really confused/put-off by a heavy metallic taste... not sure if it was the artichoke or the tomato, but it was very odd. Prior to that visit, omelet came with sour cream, when description said \""""goat cheese.\"""" Not sure what's happening there.\n\nService remains excellent - staff is friendly and helpful. Love the interior space, even if it's a bit cramped. Colectivo coffee is always outstanding.\n\nAnd, minor gripe, but... say you're not a big fan of the potatoes that come as a side, nor of the toast. You're not allowed to substitute anything without paying a premium... $2 for a handful of some greens instead of potatoes and toast seems a bit excessive to me."""
"My dad and I went to Biaggi's on a recommendation from a friend.  We were told it was like an upscale Olive Garden.  We had the sea bass and triggerfish, and I thought the food was great, but a little over priced considering the dinner entrees didn't come with a salad. Definitely make a reservation from an weekend dinner, the place was packed and really noisy.  Should have requested a booth for a little more quiet/private feel."
"""I eat here at least once EVERY TIME I visit Vegas.  It's not your 100% authentic Japanese sushi place but hey I'm not a sushi snob.  I would have to say that they have the largest selection of Americanized Sushi Rolls anywhere.  The 777 roll is my favorite.  The \""""hot\"""" foods are not bad but pale in comparison to their rolls.  Order a few of the special rolls and you're good to go.  California Rockin Sushi has NOTHING on this place.  In fact ever since I started going to Osaka I refuse to ever eat at CRS."""
"I was in town and didn't wanna drive to the Carson strip. Found this place thanks to the girl at the front desk of our hotel. Top shelf liquer was super cheap, no cover and people were friendly and made us feel like we were regulars. Girls were receptive. Talked to everyone and they bought us shots. We did have an issue with one girl who was yelling at us, but the bouncer was cool and told them to shut up and invited us back for the next day!  It's a little local joint with big time potential. If they read this; Thanks for your hospitality and showing us Jersey Boys a good time. Oh yeah, and thanks to the girls who drove us home since the cab service in town sucks."
"This location is a very good example for what a Starbucks should be.  Usually, the service is good and timely, even if you go during a rush in the afternoon.  The wifi can be hit or miss depending on how many people are using it.\n\nThe reason for the four star rating is the problem that is common to most State St/Campus open areas - the transient/homeless population.  It's not unusual for one table to be taken up by someone's plastic bags or someone to be sitting out panhandling.  It's not Starbuck's fault - you see that at most coffee shops in the area.  There's really not much they can do to control the problem, short of kicking them out.  That's an issue for the city of Madison to deal with."
"""Four stars because I love this free pool - it is pretty chill and always nice to relax at. The waterfall pool is freezing cold though and of course it's the \""""cool\"""" one though but it is so cold you barely see people in it! \nThe bartenders are also nice at the pool... \nHowever we did try to go eat inside Hooters to get some freakin' wings after swimming one day and our server failed to greet us within TEN minutes! As we were leaving a server came over like: Do you need anything?? UMMM how bout asking us that TEN MINUTES AGO?!! Anyway, if we want wings, next time we will just order from the pool bartenders!"""
"Some harsh reviews here, but for $20 I don't expect too much.\n\nWe stayed here Wednesday after a night at Joshua Tree.  The slots were not too tight and I managed to win about $100 on $.25 slots.  The complimetary White Russians were available no matter how cheap the games we played.\n\nThe room was a bit crumby, but again, I was not expecting much.  Dan Marino's restaurant (see review) was good.  Staff was friendly.  Overall a good experience, especially considering the price."
"I am a huge fan of Burlington. As a child, I could not appreciate going shopping with my mom. As a man, I can truly appreciate the expansion of my wardrobe at a discounted price. I came here initially to buy a tux for 2nd Chance Prom. I got a Andrew Fezza tux for less than $100. After getting it tailored drove the price up, but now I have a tux that is fitted. \n\nI have come back many times since then for bowties, dress shirts, and shoes. Get out of here. Cole Haan wingtip dress shoes in leather and suede for $50 a pair. It is a steal. Now please don't go shopping here. Just leave those for me. Especially if you are a size 10 1/2. Not only are their clothing items cheap, so are their home goods. I have bought items for the grill, kitchen, and random decorative pieces. This might become my second favorite store."
"Ok, so I haven't had a lot of experience with different tea houses.  I haven't had the need to try anything else!  I've had several of the teas, including the mixed fruit drink both as a tea and blended, the barley boba tea, and the almond boba tea.  I'd have to say that the mixed fruit one is my favorite!  It has lot of pieces of strawberries and apples, and its nice and sweet in a fruity sort of way.  The smoothie version, which I think is better, reminds me of Tropical Smoothie or Jamba Juice, but better!  \n\nThe service is always awesome here.  The girls are friendly and always willing to help you make a decision (the menu is huge!).  I haven't had the food, but there are quite a few dishes here that at least look yummy, particularly the soups.\n\nEven if you don't like traditional teas (like me), or have had bad experiences with boba tea elsewhere, try this place out.  You won't be disappointed with the mixed fruit tea, trust me!"
"Charlie's is not my favorite place, but I go a lot because I have a ton of friends who like to go.  There is something going on at Charlie's.  Whether it be strippers on Monday nights or Pussy LeHoot and friends on Sunday.  \n\nThe bartenders pour a strong beverage, so be ready!  Drinks are three for one on Sunday afternoons, and two for one on Thursday evenings.\n\nThere are three other Charlie's locations too.  Las Vegas, Denver, and Chicago.  I have also been to Charlie's Denver.  I believe that Phoenix has the biggest one of the four.  Huge dance floor, plenty of space inside. Out back the patio is colossal! There is a volleyball court back there too!\n\nOne of my favorite things about Charlie's is the taco stand!  They have the best tacos and burritos ever!  Tacos are small and only a buck each...perfect for a snack.  the burrito is five bucks and worth it!  You can get food inside the back patio or directly from Camelback.\n\nI recommend coming on a Sunday night.  Have a taco or burrito and see Pussy LeHoot!"
"Outside of my ears, I had no experience with any body modification/piercing. I wanted my nipples pierced for years and I finally mustered up the courage to do it. I researched piercing salons in my area and I found this place in that search. Just about every review was good, basically everyone was satisfied, so this was comfort to my inexperience. I got in the car and drove to the salon and shaking in my sneakers walked into this place. The apprentice gave me lots of information, made me feel completely comfortable. Diana, the piercer walked me through it. Gave me lots of information as well. Two weeks after I got pierced, the balls begin to sink into my skin, I went back to the salon and Diana was very helpful in assisting me with longer barbells. I've had a great experience at Sadu and if I decided to get anything else pierced I'd definitely go back."
"Service has slipped since they moved into their beautiful new building. Today was our third visit since the new place opened. We were seated quickly, but waited nearly 15 minutes before someone stopped by for a drink order, and nobody stopped in to check on us or refill our drinks once food was delivered.\n\nAs usual, the food was excellent and the staff was friendly. But despite what seemed to be dozens of employees roaming the floor, we felt like we were invisible. Lo-Lo's has been a regular in our weekend breakfast rotation for a few years now. Perhaps it's time to look around a bit."
"Frozen Custard. What's not to like? Perhaps the fact that this place is in the deep underbelly of ghetto fabulous Vegas and nestled under the shadow of the Stratosphere? For sure, it's not in the greatest neighborhood. But have no fear. What doesn't kill you only fills your tummy with sweet goodness.\n\nI'll be honest. I'm never in that part of town. As a result, I can't see myself returning to Luv-It any time soon. But that doesn't make me any less of a fan. It's Frozen Custard. It's yummy. End of line."
"St Vinny's Rocks! Yes, you may have to do some digging.. and some of the stuff is junk. However, there are some great things hiding amidst the rubble. I highly recommend checking out their furniture section. I found my desk chair there, and I love it, leather and aluminum mid-century modern and in great shape! I would have paid at least $250 online, but got it for a steal of $10. Yeah!"
"This place's prices were as high as it's breathtaking views of Las Vegas.  The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that the price gouging was unusually high, even for Las Vegas.  But what a view!  Still VERY well worth it."
"The guys at Xpress Lube do a great job and are super friendly. While some people have commented that it's pricey, for the service you get, it's not bad at all. A full-service oil change, including a nice vacuuming of the interior, is less than $40. Not bad for 15 minutes and getting exactly what you came for. They even turned off that annoying dashboard light that so many places overlook and showed me my air conditioning filter. I have NEVER had a quick change place check that before. And, while I didn't want to spend the $29.99 to have it replaced, it was comforting to know that they were that thorough. Another thing that set them apart in my book was their honesty. I very recently replaced my engine air filter. Places I've been before would try to tell me it was dirty just weeks after I had replaced it. These guys noted that it looked new and didn't need to be changed. A+ for that!\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick, quality oil change."
"First, I gave NN 4 stars because the only thing we have ever had was their pizza (we are veggie people). But if I were judging solely on the pizza, they would get 5 thumbs up!!! As a Sicilian from Chicago, we love deep dish pizza. NY style totally turns me off! What's the point? You have to eat the whole pie to feel slightly full! Have never had a bad pizza from these guys! The amount of the toppings are perfect and the total flavor of the pizza is GREAT! I love visiting when you see the HUGE pot of sauce boiling on the stove. Just want to pick up a piece of bread and dip!\nAlthough the deco needs a bit cheering up, who could go wrong with HOCKEY!!!"
"I really enjoy this place for the restaurant portion.  It's usually been delicious.  The only bad thing is the unfortunate crowd flow, as the bar is right by the front door.  If it's packed, you will have to front and butt nudge one thousand people to get to the host station.  The bar is not bad, but it can get just way too packed over the weekend.  The Sunday brunch is delicious but guilt inducing, as I guess any bar town brunch should be."
"Although I don't have a difficult time believing both poor and positive reviews for this place, I can only remark on my own experience.\n\nWith that said my chicken, tomatoe, and garlic pizza was really good! The place was a bit of a dump but the food was yummy. I also got garlic rolls that were nice and soft with a tasty marinara dipping sauce and a ceaser salad that was nothing great. Just lettuce croutons and some store bought dressing probably, but it was healthyish :-)\n\nI would definately recommend this based on this experience here. In fact I liked it a bit more than Ian's (I did not expect that)!\n\nI did think the price was a little high for per slice but doing there speacial deals brought the price where I liked when buying a full pizza.\n\nSo, go here. Its good greasy cheesy yummy pizza."
"Red state Chinese (yup they've got the horoscope place mats) in a worn hole in the wall in a strip mall. But huge portions of well prepared grub and excellent prices. Great value, and some talent in the kitchen."
I don't know what James is thinking--Panda Express doesn't compare.\n\nI've eaten here over 50 times. It's always the same . . . it's always awesome.
"I only give this place 4 stars because my favorite doctor is no longer here. We've been clients for 15+ years. We usually drive to see her for the big stuff but for emergencies and routine nail trims we stay close to home. Staff is friendly, facilities are clean and it looks like they just remodeled again."
"""I been coming here for about 17 years now, It's my favorite Chinese restaurant in LV. This is the best Chinese restaurant here, even thought that doesn't say much, because there are just not too much choices. \n\nThey were closed down for remodeling for a few months and we have no place to go eat. We had to suffer with high priced and not so good Chinese food for a while, and it sucked. I think I suffered depression because of it.\n\nIf you come here and order salt and pepper pork chop, fried and braised Chilean sea bass, and veggies, there is no way they would screw that up for you.\n\nThe best part about this place is \""""price is right\""""."""
"Im not going to repeat what the other reviewers have said so just go and experience it for yourself.  Its a fabulous little shop and the employees are cheerful and grounded, not cranky or snobby. However you define yourself, you'll find something special."
"There's still no grocery in the Hill, so many Hill residents come here by bus to do their shopping. There are always lots of folks standing around in the parking lot socializing, which brings a smile to my face. \n\nThe store itself is small by Giant Eagle standards so selection is limited, but I can't complain about having a major grocery store right in the heart of the south side. \n\nAlso, you can park in their lot on Friday and Saturday nights while you're partying it up on Carson Street. Ignore the signs about towing unauthorized cars - that has never been enforced."
"I take my car to get washed here every once in a while.  $6 for a basic car wash isn't bad.  This location has one of the full car wash machines not the little ones that are self service.  I always wanted to take pics while driving through a car wash, so....Action pics included above.\n\nSince there was some recent construction on the roads near our house, my Wife's car had some tar stains on the side panels.  After this wash, they were all gone.\n\nWill I return?  You bet!"
"I frequented this Sonic for years when I lived in Vegas.  Since moving away, Sonic is really the only thing about Vegas (aside from a few really good people) that I miss. No Sonic where I ive now, but the commercials taunt me. \nThe drinks are the best.  Go between 2-4 pm for happy hour.  Half price drinks.\nI hate to admit being addicted to their Super Sonic breakfast burritos, and even have a weakness for their foot-long coneys. Generally, hot dogs are not something I will eat- but Sonic somehow does those right."
"""This Panera is like all the others, free wifi, a good place to study, and free refills on coffee.  However, this one closes early at 8p every day except Sunday, when they close at 7p.  Usually they are nice and won't kick you out right at closing.  There are also only a few good tables to get power if you are using a laptop, and they aren't the best for spreading out your studying material.  But it's free, so I don't want to complain.  \n\nOverall, the food is good.  If you are l looking for something healthy, get the \""""You Pick Two\"""" with a turkey sandwich and black bean soup."""
"I didn't actually get any work done with these guys, I was a walk in on a day they happened to be short handed, but I did schedule an appointment with them for later in the week based on their well kept garage,  clean uniforms, and friendly personable service, unfortunately I had to cancel due to the fact I needed my car worked on asap,  so I ended up going to the next garage over to proctors discount automotive who did a 5 star job fixing my car, but the fact that pro-tech was to busy to take my business that day is not there fault,  they run a well organized tight ship over there I can tell. I would recommend the guys next door first because they did an awesome job, but I also know you can't go wrong here."
"Ok, my daughter was dressing to be Elsa for a Make a Wish event for a little girl. She ordered a wig on line and it was to small. I called ahead and they said they could help. The first two people int he place were not super friendly but then an angle came alone. she allowed us to try on a few and helped explain how to get the wig on. She was just so helpful we will be back for any future costumes. They do have a large variety or wigs and costumes for what I could see. I just love good customer service and I am glad we waited around long enough to have this lady help us. She was the best"
gone!!!! finally went out of business. Can't believe it took This long.  Wonder what's coming next.
Coming from NYC it's been a struggle to find a reasonably priced Italian meal  that's decent and edible without going broke. I live in this area and find the food at Pullano's\nto be very good tasting and the portion size is a good value. The wings here are also top notch and for a local joint  ya can't beat it.
"""Had it not been for the guy that was working there this Saturday, we would be out of a vehicle and in deep sh&t.  There was much confusion in the office mostly apparently because of a Vinnie that wasn't even there.  Apparently Vinnie takes reservations but with not enough information (such as \""""this customer needs a minivan\"""").  A few other people in there were also having isssues.  Had it not been for this Saturday guy (wish I knew his name), no one would have had a vehicle.  He did the best he could with what he had and managed to make everyone there very happy.  Quite an achievement.  It seemed like an employee was put into a very stressful situation because of another employee.  Thank goodness we got what we needed."""
"If you're going to make it worth coming here, I recommend ordering tea.  I would avoid paying for overpriced boba(bubble) tea or milk teas.  However, their specialty teas in the teapots are definitely worth a try.  We tried the grass jelly hot tea pot.  It is served hot, but it gels up like gelatin as it cools.  It has red beans, boba, and maybe some other ingredients that I don't remember.  I've never paid $7-$8 for bubble tea before!!!  Ridiculous.  I'd look for nearby competitors for bubble tea but for food and tea, I'd definitely recommend checking this place out.  The location is a bit inconveniently off the strip near the Chinatown area.  The place is small cozy and clean with bright lighting."
Grade: B-\n\nGreat food but a very loud place. I prefer not to shout during dinner.
"HUGE portions and great dishes.\nSo far, we have tried their crepes, a few omelettes, the Dutch baby, etc.\nService is always nice, but they do tend to get VERY busy on weekend mornings at this location (Fort Apache) So either get there early, or expect a wait.\n\nCons: A little pricier than the average breakfast fare, but it is understandable with the huge portions they give you.  MY wife and I can barely get halfway through each dish that we have ordered.\nBut, contrary to the huge portions, they discourage sharing by charging the second person almost full-price if you do share.  I don't see too many restaurants doing this nowadays and it just seems like a real nickle and dime tactic to save a buck.   \n\nAll in all though, that shouldn't really discourage anyone from trying this great restaurant out.  Try the buckwheat pancakes!"
"""There are so many souvenir shops in Vegas that carry the same stuff, and I constantly wonder if I will find something better or cheaper at the next store.  This one has everything...and it's the cheapest.  So make your life easier and just come here.\n\nWe laughed when I walked by the \""""insult parrot\"""" and it said, \""""Hey baby, show me your tits!\"""" Lots of fun trinkets like that.\n\nExcellent for bachelor or bachelorette parties, birthdays, or just fun stuff to take home to your friends.  The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it really is all the usual stuff you see at the other souvenir shops."""
"After having an unpleasant experience at Thai Grill involving a waiter, the owner contacted me to apologize and ask that we give his restaurant another chance.\n\nBoy am I glad we did!\n\nWe decided to re-visit the restaurant for lunch  today, without alerting the owner we would be stopping in.\n\nOn this outing the service was prompt, cheerful, and the food  was very good!\n\nThe fresh spring rolls were cool and crunchy. They were filled was the usual suspects along with tasty pieces of fried tofu, and chilled chicken.\n\nThe Basil Chicken was a delicious mix of spices and minced chicken.\n\nThe Green chicken curry was excellent. Made with homemade curry and filled with a great selections of vegetables.\n\nBoth lunch specials were served with a tasty vegetable soup, full of squash and cabbage.\n\nI am very glad to have found a quality Thai restaurant in my area, hopefully my previous experience was just a fluke."
The workers are very friendly. The food selections are getting much better. But the prices are still a bit on the high side.\n\nWent to purchase a crate that was on sale but they didn't have anymore and they couldn't give me a rain check because it was a special sale. But the manager was very nice enough to give me another crate that was much better & more $$ then the one that was on sale. So I was a super happy.\n\nI didn't give it 5 stars because they still don't carry the food my baby eats.
"I used to frequent Volcano Tea often during high school; it's where my friends and I liked to hang out and enjoy boba beverages. I stopped visiting a few years ago, primarily due to my lack of interest in boba and also because I wasn't in Chinatown as much.\n\nAnyway, sometimes I still have a craving for boba and fortunately I was in Chinatown today when it happened. The space has changed a bit with a lot less room to sit since there's more counter/work area to accommodate the addition of snow ice. It was relatively busy, but I was able to order as I entered and waited just a few minutes for my drink.\n\nI love milk tea with boba, so I always order one with just a variation of flavor. Today I went with a Large Taro Milk Tea - with boba, of course ($3.95 with tax). The tea wasn't too sweet and the boba was fabulous - soft and chewy! Oh, so yummy! I guess it's been a while since I've had good boba, but this is the stuff. I'll be back for more when I'm in the mood!"
"They were professional, not pushy, respectful and worked with me. They made sure they answered any question I might possibly of had. I did not buy a car due to my financial situation but when it comes time for me to get the one I want, I will go to this location."
"I got a piercing here from...Joe (i think that is his name but i could be making that up). \nI just re-did my bottom belly button because it closed up. He thought it didn't look closed so he tried to taper it which I thought was really nice because that is way cheaper than a piercing, and he could have not said anything about the alternative.\n\nIn the end though he did end up re-piercing it for me and discussed every decision (whether or not to go through the same hole, etc.) with me which I really appreciated.\n\nIt was $44 total with jewelry and tax which is an average price. The piercing and jewerly look great, and I would totally recommend going to them!\n\nWould go back there if I decide to get my lip done. \n\nOooo I wish they did surface piercings!"
"Was on S. jones street and needed a ride back to the strip. Weren't any cabs so called this company. Wait time quoted was about 15-35 minutes, they came at around 12 minutes. Fast!"
"""When I think of State Street, this is the place that comes to mind. Never had a bad time here. However (there is always a however), there should be televisions outside for watching whatever games are on. Also, there should be at least a beer \""""person\"""" outside to avoid the lines inside (if that's legal). Free popcorn is always nice, but there should be one also on the second floor."""
"Yeah, I love Cici's. I am ashamed to admit how much I love it. It's not fancy at all, and the pizza is not fabulous pizza; however, for less than $15, two grown folks can get their bellies full of cheesy deliciousness. It's fast, dirty, and ultimately satisfying...kind of like a peep show in its way.\n\nThe place is overrun with children usually, as I guess families really appreciate the ability to feed a whole horde of folks this cheaply. And like everywhere with kids, it sometimes means that things are messy, spilled, loud, and sticky...but when you're eating as much pizza and cinnamon rolls as your heart can desire, it's hard to complain.\n\nA night of Cici's paired with a dollar movie (or a $.25 movie on Monday nights) is a dream date in these economic times."
I'm from Texas so its hard to find any good brisket other than Texas but I think the road kill grill came pretty darn close! My husband and I will definitely be back.
"I found my first experience with the unwich to be a delightful treat.  I must eat gluten free so I am always wary of the ability of sandwich shops to meet my needs.  They did a wonderful job of keeping my unwich from cross-contamination and I loved every bite of the all veggie choice (sans avocado spread which couldn't be verified gluten free).  I did find it a bit odd that all of there deli meats had gluten but better safe than sorry.\n\nIf I had written this review yesterday I would have given 5 stars.  However, today I ordered the same unwich for dinner and was pretty disappointed by how wilted and even brown pieces of the lettuce holding the unwich together were.  I would expect crisp and fresh lettuce since the lettuce is a key player here.\n\nAll in all, I'd go back and keep my fingers crossed for fresher lettuce."
"""Having been to the Philippines working on U.S. Military projects, I was used to ethnic Filipino cuisines while I was there decades ago.\n\nI came to know that an old professional colleague of mine is now a Las Vegas resident and was quite surprised to received my unexpected call. With his directions, we eventually met at this Filipino restaurant for a quick lunch, for I intended to be driving back to LA afterwards that day.\n\nHowever, the quick lunch turned out into a seemingly endless feast of Filipino cuisines and delicacies, as we talked about old times, the best of times, as well as the worst ones in the Philippines and in various countries we've been while deployed overseas.\n\nI was glad I relented coming to Fiesta Filipina, instead of insisting for my friend to come over for buffet at the restaurant in my hotel.\n\nIncidentally, the word \""""Fiesta\"""" in Filipino language means feast, and that was really a sumptuous feast we had.\n\nThe next time I'll be in Vegas, I'll definitely come by this place near the southeast corner of Jones and Desert Inn.\n\nAnd indeed, just like aged fine wines, old time friends are certainly considered the best."""
The food is ok.  My daughter and I ordered a steak and cheese sandwhich and my husband ordered a chili cheeseburger and onion rings.  Our food was decent but his burger wasn't tasty.   I wish they made their own ice cream.  I come here for the brownie sundae which is huge and delicious!  I haven't tried their other desserts yet but they look good.
"I wanted to pick up some dessert drinks to share with a female friend after we went on a dinner date.  This place had everything that I could imagine.  I had an impulse to just grab a grocery cart and stock up.  No, no, self-control.  \n\nTotal Wine is like the Harris Teeter for wine and beer.  They carry plenty of independently owned brewed beers (like Hobgoblin-one of my favorites).  I didn't come here for beer, but I am a guy and I like beer more than wine.  I made a comprimise and picked up two big bottles of Chocolate Stout with a bottle of Lambic.  Pour three fourths of beer into a pint glass and one fourth Lambic, skip the chocolate cake.  \n\nI liked this place, but I prefer smaller shops, helping out the little man.  I would come back if I had to pick up something quick."
"""Perfect joint if you're looking for a truely SOUTHERN REDNECK HANGOUT where the regular patrons are loud, rude, and vulgar.

So if you have time to spare and don't mind redneck gawking as a past time, feel free to stand around and wait while the \""""regulars\"""" drink, swear, and watch tv.\nWhy would anyone ever eat here?!\nBTW - Lying about the number of stars is the only way to prevent honest negative reviews from becoming buried in cyberspace."""
"""It's rather difficult to find, hidden in the back of an otherwise boring office plaza. They clearly do not get much walk-by traffic here. It's also a little out of place in a city like Charlotte, where barbecue and Bojangles fried chicken usually rule the roost.\n\nKatz is a standard New York-style Jewish deli (though not kosher), decorated with assorted New York memorabilia including the front page of the Post celebrating the Mets/Yankees World Series and pictures of the World Trade Center. If they're trying to show their New York creds, they've succeeded.\n\nDepending on the server's mood, they'll put a bowl of cole slaw and some pickles on the table when you're seated. Katz serves the usual stuff you'd expect for such a restaurant - corned beef, pastrami, etc. What's not to be beat are the \""""Smokey Joe\"""" - whitefish and nova on a bagel (get an everything bagel, of course!) and the classic Reuben sandwich. Doctor Brown's sodas available too. The chicken soup is just as good as what mom makes.\n\nIf they have any left, take some rugelach to go! (They do not accept AmEx.)"""
"""**Do not follow the \""""1 Wild Way\"""" address for directions; instead, plug 7340 Butler Street, Pittsburgh.

Really bad food and the dining room that we had to eat in was horribly filthy dirty.

I agree about this place being a wonderful spot for a special occasion. The food is amazing and the view can't be beat. The service is excellent. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the pricey menu. I understand that this is a very nice restaurant and the prices reflect that but they have a policy of making you pay for a side dish which runs about $10. This is the second time I went with only one other person. The side dish they give is a large quantity which is too much for 2 people. If you don't pay for a side dish it only comes with a salad and the fish. It just feels wrong to charge so much for a plate of vegetables. If they want to charge for a side dish how about the option of a medium or large portion or charge what you really have to for the meal. It just takes something away from the experience to feel like you are getting ripped off to charge so much for a plate of vegetables.
I used to shop at this Skechers all the time until I discovered the mega store on East Flamingo.  Go there instead if you can!
keep your eyes open! its not in a shopping strip...  it's a hidden jewel
"Chill atmosphere, decent vegan options and moderate prices; why did it take me so long to visit?\n\nThe Diamond has lots of local drama drama in how it came to be (and how The Penguin came to suck). For more reading! Look at others' reviews or google it.\n\nNow to focus on the place itself: comfy booths, dim lighting, and very popular to the alternative-sort of people without Charlotte. This place is one of the Must-Go's in Plaza Midwood.\n\nThe food is as diner traditional as they can get (while still adding a modern flourish). I have the Jumbo Soy Dog which came with meatless chili, mustard, onions and coleslaw on it. I was pretty impressed and quite happy.\n\nEven though much of the menu is barred off to do due to my veganism and hatred of greasy food, I'll definitely be back!"
Best Soulfood I had since i've lived in Vegas and thats saying alot being that Vegas is deprived in the food catogory
Rather swell thai food. Interior could use some major re-decoration. They leave the buffet table out with old signs really taking away from the experience . The food portions are plentiful.
Nice place and staffs.  The food is good too. They just lack a variety of Japanese food and only offer some of the most popular Japanese foods. I guess it's simply Madison that we dont have a lot of choices. I love the location though.
"Have used the same stylist (Cheyenne) for more than 3 years. We've never been disappointed. You won't find a better venue for small kids to get a haircut without the drama of most adult salons. The kids even get to pick from fitetrucks, cabs or animals to sit on while stylists specializing in cutting kids hair work their magic. My biggest problem is getting my son out of the place with all the videos and toys."
"Ordered take out last night and it was my first visit here. The place was packed on a Friday night and I'm pretty sure I took the last parking spot in this very crowded stripmall. I've never had Korean food before so I went with the most popular yelp item reviewed... the meat jun\n\nFrom the first bite, I was in love. There's this burst of flavor that reminds me of food I've had in Hawaii (go figure). I know something is good when I can't stop thinking about how good it was and when I can get back. Thank goodness I live close by  so Island Style will be one of my new hot spots. I'm definitely looking forward to the eating in experience.\n\nI have to thank yelpers for finding this as I don't think I honestly would have ever tried it on my own."

"""If you are like me,  you are so sick of cookie cutter, bland chain burger joints.  That is the reason why I love this place so much!  I usually go with the \""""On the Border Burger\"""" with fries and a cherry vanilla Mister Pibb.  The bar is worth hitting up too if you are in the market to throw back a few while any of the local Valley sports teams play.  Outside of that, the toppings bar is well stocked, and clean.  The food is always tasty and made in front of you with a relatively short wait.  The restaurant is easy to find on the south east corner of 15th Ave & Thomas.\n\nMy only star deduction is due to the fact that the tables are usually not cleaned well or fast enough.  I shouldn't have to clean up after the last customer, but most of the time I have."""
"As the name suggests, it's a great place for all kinds of tea.  The milk tea here is as close as it gets to the ones in Taiwan.  Although the bubba tends to be slightly overcooked.  I am not a fan of the food here......it's really just a drink and dessert place!"
"The beef bimbibop was really really good! I also enjoyed the small free table appetizers, it was a tasty treat before the food came. The food was prepared quickly, but the cans of soda for $2 each was not cool, and because it is so small they have like 2 servers, so keep that in mind if you want attention and quick service. My wife had the dish in the stone bowl and hated it, as did her mom. The potstickers and sushi rolls were excellent! If you go for the food I'd give it 4 stars, but you have to be forgiving of the decor and service..."
"True hardware store. They have everything. Go here before throwing anything out, you can probably find what you need to fix it. Also, go here BEFORE a project, because you'll find things to simplify the job. Staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. One star short because they don't put prices on most items. Fine if you're buying on a company acct and don't care what things cost. But for me doing personal projects, I have to know what I'm spending. Plus, in a place like this, I may buy things I don't even need yet if the price is right. But you have to chase down a salesman with an available computer to find out."
the school is very structured an very key on great education...it's def worth the 22k a year per child plus all the other fees...starts from pre k through high school so no worries about wondering if your kids won't be happy when they go to the next grade...only thing that sucks is pick up...you need to be at least 30 mins early prior to dismissal:(
"The gator bites tasted like cooter but that's straight cause I enjoy cooter, opossum, coon and all sorts of critters. And I would know cause I'm from Louisiana the swamp part. Anyways yeah, I love this cooter or opossum whatever it was."
"This place is old school! They actually pay attention to showing up on time, doing the job quickly and correctly, being friendly, and then you get a hand-typed bill in the mail sometime after your service. Very reasonable. A family run business. Don't let their lack of internet presence turn you off...they just don't know about it yet!"
"""They picked up on my ABC (American Born Chinese) accent right away!  That and the \""""QQ\""""ness of the boba speak to the authenticity of this place!

"Location can't be beat. Price is the best for a campus area room. Only downside is that the rooms are tiny, but I'm not spending much time on them when I'm in madison. Has a mini fridge to keep the back up beers chilled.  I never, ever had and issue with the staff or rooms not being clean."
"I've been to most of the 24's in Vegas. Been to this location twice. \n\nPros:\nClean\nStaff always been friendly\nSuper-Sport\nI didn't find broken equipment\nQuiet. No problems with parking\nA lot of cardio equipment\n\nI didn't have good workouts here, but not blaming this gym. Both times that I've come here, I was nursing a rotator cuff issue and a torn meniscus.  The intensity in those workouts were poor at best.  However, a kind woman helped me with a couple of last reps on the leg extension machine. I guess it was obvious to her my knee was in pain. She even massaged it and told me that her sons had the same issue. She gave me a little tip, to put a bag of frozen peas on my knees when i get home. That worked wonders, at least worked better than ice.  Originally thought she worked at the gym or was a trainer. Later found out that she didn't. Never got a chance to thank her or get her name.  \n\nIf in the area, I will check out this gym again."
Had a great breakfast of walleye and eggs after my football team (Oregon State Beavers) got murdered the day before at camp Randall.  Bloody mary was good too!
"Absolutely gorgeous hotel! I believe it's a four star hotel, as far as hotel ratings go, however, you would think there would be more amenities with the price per room. I get not having a free breakfast or anything like that, but they even charge $5 for the bottle of water they leave in your room. And $9.95 a day for wifi?! That's just not right! I look forward to trying the speakeasy tomorrow night, which I heard is pretty cool."
"Can I be a fan of this place even though I don't have kids? \nBecause I am! \n(Is that weird?)\nI don't care. \n\nThe place is packed with interesting, educational, FASHIONABLE (check out the boys hats you guys) items for little ones of all ages. And although I was there this weekend looking for some dinnerware (think plates, forks, spoons) which they don't carry, they were quick to refer me to some other spots in town where I'd have more luck. And did they suggest department stores which would be super easy and a sure thing? Nope! Three other super solid locally owned recommendations. Talk about supporting your neighbors! The staff is pretty darn knowledgeable about what they carry, so if you're doing some holiday gifting or just need a little something for someone you care about, tell them the age, likes/dislikes and let them set you on a path to the perfect puzzle or something plush."
"Do stop in and eat if you get the chance. \n\nBandung is not much to look at outside, especially compared to some of the unique store fronts on Willy Street...but once my fiance and I sat down on the patio and had a glance at the menu, it surely didn't matter.\n\nWe dined on a Sunday evening, an evening when Bandung has a SUPER cheap menu of eats. Dishes are $5 and can satisfy a woman with a moderate appetite. He was still hungry with one of the $5 dishes and some kebabs. I'm guessing the $5 plates were likely a tad smaller than their regular dishes. We shared the Kebabs, an Ayam, Sapi, and Tempe, and oh my GOSH the sauce was amazing!\n\nMuch to our delight, the same sauce was drizzled over the Gado Gado, which we both ordered, as $5 plates on the patio. Steamed vegetables, tofu, and egg, with the delicious peanut sauce. MMMM. \n\nI'm now googling Indonesian food to make at home."
"I've been to a couple of local BBQ joints in town and have hated them all. I finally admitted that the only place I could get decent BBQ is Lucille's or Memphis BBQ. I was talking to a coworker about the lack of good BBQ in this city and she mentioned the Road Kill Grill. She said that she lived close by and since I lived on the opposite side of town, she would stop and get me a plate. The next day she came in with a very heavy styrofoam plate and told me that the price had recently gone up to $15. When I got home, there was chicken, ribs, links, and brisket along with mac & cheese, and beans. There was a regular sauce and a spicy one. The amazing part of it all is that ALL of it was very good.  I was shocked. It was VERY good, only cost $15 and the two of us ate off of it for three days. What an amazing meal. I have only one regret. I live so far away from it. I'll definitely have it again."
"I recently had this company out and was not happy with the first guy that came out. He was grumpy and unhelpful. We called the office and we were going to cancel, but the office lady stated she would send out another tech. She sent out Luis Sanchez the next day. He was nice and knew what he was doing. He saved the day for A & B Security. Based on the first tech I was going to cancel and post bad review, but Luis did a great job!!"
"The campus Garcia's has closed!  What a shame - it was in the coolest building!  I can't say I'm surprised though.  I can't remember the last time I was in there and wasn't the only customer.\n\nLuckily, the one out on Mattis is still open."
"After telling the cashier how happy I am with them, I asked why they don't have a tip jar. She politely said we don't take tips and then gave me a coupon for a free dinner.    ...?"
"The over-baking issues seem, for the most part, to be resolved. Yay! \n\nTheir only remaining fault, as I see it, is that they don't have the best sandwich selection and rarely have meatless sandwiches. They used to make this amazing egg salad sandwich that was wonderfully flavored with the perfect amount of fresh dill, but I haven't seen it in over a year. If they bring that back (and start making the fresh mozzarella and pesto sandwiches more often), I'll happily up them to five stars. \n\nMan, I hope the folks at Mirabelle are reading this =)"
Great food! \n\nCheesy decor.\n\nBut lots of tables to choose from.\n\nFast service.\n\nBut not so friendly employees.\n\nJust let the gyros take you awayyyyyyyyy!
"I admit I am not an expert on Indonesian food (to the extent there is such a monlithic thing, given regional variations), but the food here rang true to my experiences on Java, less so on other islands. We arrived there after a protracted happy hour, but had the wisdom to check their hours and call ahead. We were told they stopped seating at 8:45, and made sure we arrived a couple minutes before. Service was pleasant, good, and we were not hurried at any point during a lengthy meal. We chose to dine outside and lamps were promptly brought and relit for us. The dishes I had were well prepared, generous, and spiced to my preferences. Bandung also has a fine, reasonably priced selection of beers and ales that complement the food. I am puzzled by some of the other comments I see about authenticity of the food and the quality of service, but we each have our own expectations. Mine were well met."
"Not to bad, They always have lots of people working so the wait isn't usually to long."
"There aren't many Italian restraurants that I have been to in the area, probably because when I get a craving I always come here. The food and service are good, the portion sizes are large and the prices are fair. I usually order a seafood pasta dish but dinning with friends I have never heard a complaint about any of their dishes."
"What?? I have been missing this place ever since I left Pittsburgh. I even looked for it to write reviews here man... This place was one of my favorite Korean restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's family run and everyone's so friendly. One time the chili bean paste bottle exploded on my friend and I and we both got free Ginza tshirts!! hahah..see? I even remember it as a funny experience rather than a truamatizing one. Sundubu was okay. There was this BBQ pork dish that I really loved but I forgot what it's called. The recipe was given to the owner by the priest at the Korean Church in Shadyside. Ask about it. It's my all-time favorite.\n\nDon't order Sushi here tho. It's not very good. This is not the place to go for Japanese food. We used to get the fried ice cream all the time but after awhile, we got bored of it. Try it though if you haven't. I preferred the service here to the service at Sushi Kim, another Korean restaurant in the strip that some of my friends liked better. \n\nCom'on Ginza. Keep it up. I know you're good!!"
"This is the first place in Charlotte (or most of the Western half of the state for that matter) that I can actually say has good BBQ.  Every other place the Q tasted like nothing or poorly ventalated natural gas fumes.  It's not the best Q  I've had (Browns - Kingstree, SC) but it's really good and better than anything else I've had in the area.  It's open for lunch only and no credit cards."
"I just got out of the military and moved to charlotte, so naturally I was looking for a good barber shop. I decided to give this shop a try. It was a weekday afternoon so it was very empty. \n\nThe one guy there gave me my cut. Very nice, talked about sports and everything. Unfortunately I thought they would accept card, but they didn't and I had no cash. I offered to leave my ID so I could run and get some cash. The man refused and just told me to pay the next time I came in. I was taken aback at how nice and trustworthy he was, but I came back with cash 20 minutes later.\n\nSafe to say I'll be going back for my haircuts in the future."
"Always friendly workers! Extra seating upstairs, great balcony, and very cozy! The only problems I have found with it are lack of seating, like any other Starbucks, and poor Wi-Fi. Other than that, the service is amazing which is sometimes hard to find at busy coffeeshops."
"The location is a bit tucked in the corner, and the parking lot is always packed, so beware of parking! Just a friendly warning that does not affect rating. The food selection for the size of the store is great. The prices are also awesome! buying organic bananas for 39 cents a bunch....I don't think that can be beat. I see alot of the same products at whole foods here for much cheaper, so if it comes to a few select items i will pop in here first before my whole foods run. Wine selection is good if your planning on a fast grab, and they have wine tastings every so often in the lobby for those of age. It is crowded at times, but i consider this a good sign. Items i personally grab are produce, orange juice-not from concentrate, bottled water selections, and reeds ginger beer. All fresh, delicious, and well priced."
"When I first adopted my dog, I always thought I'd go to Commonwealth Animal Hospital. I had friends who also went there, and I had friends who worked there. Some how, I was swayed to a 24/7, big-box vet instead. It took me one visit there to immediately run to Commonwealth. You can't beat their customer service at ALL levels - from the front desk to the vets. They are caring, compassionate and fit my needs as a first-time pet parent. I'd highly recommend Commonwealth to those who who seek TLC with their pets!"
"""Considering the first reviewer, I wouldn't recommend taking their services from a hotel.\n\nHowever, they do offer shuttle service from the airport. You prepay, so there is no way the driver can hammer you for more money.  Just look for signs at baggage claim that say \""""Airport Shuttles\"""" or something like that.\n\nThere are actually two separate companies.  This one was a bit more expensive, but the other one only took cash.  And I forgot to get cash before leaving for Vegas.  So I had to go with this one so I can charge it.\n\nUse the airport shuttles, it's cheaper. I think it was $6 or so per person to the hotel.  Much cheaper than a cab.  They have the prices posted outside so you can check it out when you arrive."""
"Tell me I am crazy, I did not consume any brats during the time I was here.  WHAT!\n\nI will say that the cheese curds are pure delicious cheesey goodness, their bloody mary's are above par for a packed college bar in the morning, and their service was great.\n\nThe location is prime... this is some perfect people watching here.  Stamp of approval."
"I order here a lot. They always get my order right, AND find my house. Not an easy task.\n The pizza is good, never burnt or gooey, and I order online, they are nice if I need to call, but usually I don't.\n They don't offer red peppers or Parmesan Cheese anymore, which makes me a sad panda.\n All in all, glad they are nearby, and fast."
"Caring staff top to bottom.  I work with them as well (I'm a vendor), so I even know the admin staff and owners."
"""I enjoy the Church Key because there is something very cynical about drinking in a former church, hence \""""Church Key\"""".

"I come here usually about every 4 months or so (or once my heels are so cracked I can't be seen in public with sandals on). I always appreciate the ladies' recognizing me, and their suggestion that I come and sit in a pedicure chair to soak my weary feet.\n\nYou can sip on a glass of wine or a soft drink and simply enjoy the pampering. I have very ticklish feet, so I always know my grimaces during the foot massage will be met with laughter.\n\nThey are also very accommodating and conversational when necessary (if I'm not there with a friend, they'll chat with me).\n\nMy nails always end up looking great and stay that way for a few days...usually a week or two.\n\nDo remember to bring cash for a tip. I can understand why they do this, and my mani-pedi buddy usually forgets, so I bring extra.\n\nI appreciate their quick and detailed work...it's a nice treat once in a while."
"So I've never been on the inside of this Costco, I always stop in here to get gas before I jump onto the freeway. Oh I've also been in their parking lot when Slider Truck stopped by.

"I had to journey to the Phoenix Art Museum for a class project and I was going to put it off until a Friday evening but then I came across something on their website that caught my eye. Apparently on Wednesdays from 300pm-900pm the museum has no admission for students, Im not sure if its only for students or if its for everyone but once I saw that I made a trip of it. The museum is totally worth the admission fee (I learned after my voyage) but everyone likes to save money when they can :) \n\nThe exhibits are well put together and I was very surprised by the collection. \nThe Museum employees were so very nice and of course, very knowledgable of the museum and its contents.\n\nAll in all it was a wonderful evening, I spent two and a half hours with my girlfriend and we absolutely loved it. I will try and visit the museum more, next I would like to see The Heard Museum... up the street."
I come here for the buffet but I only eat one thing really and it is that bright orange sauce with chicken.  Don't know what it is called but I love it.  Put it on rice with a side of the bread and I am set.  \n\nI don't really care for anything else here honestly.
Food is great! The only problem I have with this place is the bathroom situation. They have one VERY small men's and women's bathroom in the middle of the dining floor with an outside shared sink. For a restaurant that serves fine rich buttery foods this is a mistake. If you have to go everyone will know you blew it up. Very embarrassing.
I was told by a co-lactose intolerance sufferer that this place won't make you sick and they have real good custard. I had the cherry custard one time and the western the next...I got sick both times but the custard was sooo good it was almost worth it. It's homemade. The location is quite odd since it shares the parking lot with a strip club. Did I say real good custard?

We love coming here. I hate having to go to the vet BC it gets so expensive but long is very reasonably priced. We've had 5 different doctors now and our 2 that I would recomend who are really smart and nice and my dog seems to love is Dr. Lauren and Dr. Brown. Its not everywhere you go that doctors and friendly and very well educated but here I think they are. They do a great job at explaining what's going on and why.
"This place literally saved me when our group's long day of delayed flights and frantic running thru airports put us in Madison late.  Nearly all the restaurants were closing their kitchens, but Glass Nickel's kitchen is open until midnite, AND (this is key) they deliver.  For a business traveler with no rental car and not wanting to risk driving in the snow and ice, this is a huge convenience!\n\nI got a sandwich and salad, and even though they said it might take as long as 45 minutes, there was a knock on my door in more like 30 minutes.  The sandwich was still hot and the salad greens were still cool, so I give them props for getting the order right and even getting the food to me at a nice temperature.  Highly recommend if you are the Middleton area with no room service or few options for dinner.  Save this number in your phonebook!"
"Clean, fast, super friendly. One of the better Panera's that I have been too. \nMy only beef is I think there are to many seats for the space, and when it is busy it feels WAY over crowded and hard to have a conversation with someone."
"I have always been a fan of this airline. Costs are cheap, bags are free they fly to destinations that I need to go. For work or pleasure they do the trick. Boarding has become better over the years. Instead of arriving at the airport way too early to sit on the floor to secure good seats. Pay the extra to get A boarding and you get a choice. The thing I notice on my recent flight was the leg room has shrunk or I'm getting plump. When I put the tray table down it was right on top of me. If the person in front of my reclines I am doomed. I know the airlines are changing and want to pack the plane which almost every Southwest flight is packed these days. Consider how the seats are done, I'm sure you can stuff a lot of people in but still have a little more leg room. Anyway I do like them and will continue to use. Points are good, free flights are nice But for the cost its worth it."
"Vegas is not the best place for a delicious Vegan meal but I make sure to stop at Komol for their delicious Vegan Panang dish every time i'm in town. Komol is in a sketchy looking shopping center off the beaten path but don't be scurred, the place is clean, the wait staff is super friendly, and the food is fantastic. A must stop next time you're in Vegas gambling your hard earned cash!"
"""the original was a food co-op; started in the 1960's for the enlightened who wanted organic, unprocessed whole food....what a concept!\n\n(btw...did you know the average american eats 10 lbs. of food additives per year? and collectively, our households dump about a million tons - 70% of the total - of non-biodegradable pollutants into the water & air; think laundry detergents, shampoo, soaps, cleansers, fabric softeners, household cleaners, aerosols, exhaust...)\n\nanyway...today's strawberry fields is just as cool - lots of fresh veggies, yummy seeded breads (and other breads), home-made soups...yum! i had some emergency surgery at Carle 3 years ago, and my son brought me strawberry fields home-made veggie soup & seeded bread to help speed my recovery after i got out... not that you have to be sick to enjoy this food...lol!\n\n...now with the added benefit of the healthy meals section where you can get smoothies, soups, sandwiches, salads & all manner of healthy stuff to eat & drink, sit & chat - inside or out in clement weather. a great place to meet friends, chat, & have a bite.\n\n\""""strawberry fields forever...\""""  (move over Wild Oats & Whole Foods)"""
A few years ago I was dying for a good donut...a true art form severely lacking in Las Vegas.  I am a transplant from back east so to me the Donut isn't just some supermarket purchase to shut up the rugrats.  When done right it could be a great eating experience.  \n\nI checked the local papers and read about Ronald's...and I was amazed and delighted with the results.  The donuts are crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  \n\nI love these donuts and highly recommend them.\n\nP.s.  KRISPY KREME ARE NOT DONUTS!!!
"""I effin LOVE the Penguin!\n\nI fly my effin' freak flag at the Pen every time I'm in Charlotte.  That burger rawks!  Pair it with a nice 2012 Pabst or a bottle of Cheerwine and throw in some fried pickles and you, my friend, are good to go.  You're in the South, mothertrucker!  \n\nDon't!  Do NOT!  DO NOT EVEN THIIIIIIINK about leaving without grabbing a banana pudding.  You can even take it to go, but do not leave that restaurant without banana pudding in either your stomach or your hand.  \n\nIt's one of the few places on this planet I actually invested in the apparel they had for sale.  That's how much I like the place.  I had to get myself a Penguin Drive-In trucker hat.  Then my Charlotte girlfriend's dog ate it and it's been lost until I return to the Pen for another one.  Then again, the more I think about it, the whole \""""my dog ate it\"""" sounds like bewlshlt, right?  \n\nNow I'm pissed.  But I still love the Penguin.  Five stars, bitches!"""
"These ladies are great. They pierced me, I came back with an emergency after getting help at another studio with my nose piercing (wrong gauge OUCH). They gave me a dainty one and lots of good tips on healing. They proceed to pierce with care/gentleness which is something a lot of places lack. Answered all my questions and glad to help if you come back."
"Listen, I'm incredibly picky when it comes to salons. I've tried probably a dozen salons in the years I've lived in Madison, most of them Aveda. Unlike a lot of places here, you don't feel like you have to be dressed to the nines or covered in tattoos to get a good cut. And unlike most places, you don't have to be there all fricking day. 45 minutes-an hour for consultation, scalp massage, brow waxing, cut & dry and you're on your way. \n\nI've now been to Cinema twice and will go back again. I've seen Aimee both times. She's friendly, she listens, she's efficient, and she gives a great haircut and does an excellent job with brow waxing too. $65 + tip for a cut & brows is a little steep for Madison prices but it's worth it. I like that you can book online, that the greeters are friendly and not snooty like in so many places and offer tea or water, that I haven't had to wait for my scheduled appointment (that drives me CRAZY), and, get this: they have freshly popped bags of popcorn for you."
"This is simple: Prices has the best friend chicken on earth. Period. Full stop. End of. I've had fried chicken all over the US and the world, but this is by far the best!\n\nThe only knocks I can give Prices is that a) it's cash only; b) it's carry-out only, and there nowhere in the immediate area to eat except your car; c) the side dishes are a bit of an afterthought; and d) there's always a huge line. As others have said, if you don't know what you want, or if you're talking on a cell phone, STEP OUT OF THE LINE so the rest of us can get on with our day.\n\nThat said, my tip is this: the most popular lunches are the 1/4 chicken dinners. During the lunch rush, a couple of employees will make these non-stop and stack them up. But sometimes the dinners don't get rotated out properly. The 1/2 chicken dinners are made to order each time, so if you order one of those you're guaranteed that it's fresh and hot."
"Had Cobb salad it was huge, lots of chix, bacon, blue cheese avocado and boiled eggs we had the smokey avocado ranch dressing. Also had the broiled walleye not to impressed  , had a few bones a little dry , most of the menu is great, big portions. I've been here maybe a dozen times and the walleye was the only disapointment. Ck it out u won't b sorry"
Hey what can I say its the dive bar of dive bars. One minute you can have a bum drinking out of a pitcher cussing his buddy and the next you can watch the hipsters talk about their day. they have cheap beer and strong drinks. Dont forget the awesome tiki style
"Love the food, I have never had a bad order! I wish they'd get the order correct more often. When you have a picky eater, there is no fixing a burrito with EVERYTHING on it and you don't know it's made wrong until the person bites into the burrito...\n\nI'm not the picky eater in the bunch, but I think that the kitchen here works at a fast pace and either emits or includes an unwanted topping here or there because of the fast pace... hey, it happens no matter which drive thru you pull into.\n\nBoth the red and green sauce are tasty, as are the chicken, carnitas , and carne asada in tacos/burritos/quesadillas. The plain cheese quesadilla is pretty full of flavor. The food is never cold, and the service is pretty good as well. \n\nFor those that like to split their portions, everything heats up well at home."
"It's like $4.50 for a dozen.  Is that good?  I really don't know.  This is a bagel factory - meaning they make it on site and ship them around.  What's weird is that they are open so late.  I don't remember any bagel places being open past three - and for that matter, having any bagels left after 11 on a weekend.  But that was in another state...\n\nAs for the bagels, I guess they're alright.  A little bit undersized, with all the usual types you had as a kid (sesame, poppyseed, onion), and then some concessions to more 'interesting' kinds, like jalapeno, or dried cranberry, etc.  I think einstein bagels started the fancy bagel trend.  Very on the soft side - not really chewy enough for me.  But I'm fucking picky and hypercritical.\n\nBig selection of sandwiches made to order, but not like awesome overstuffed deli sandwiches or anything.  Nothing spectacular.  \n\nI've yet to try their lox (which is advertized as 'sushi on a bagel' - which irritates me for some weird reason)."
"This is mid-priced upscale stuff.  Think InStyle, Lucky, Elle. Sloan carries Ali Ro, DvF, Nanette Lepore, Theory, BCBG, Nicole Miller,  Splendid, Tracy Reese, Liquid, Fashionista, Velvet, Maria Bianco Nero, Robert Rodriquez, Cynthia Steffe, Rory Beca, Hale Bob, Pink Tartan, Byron Lars.....rich& skinny, current elliott, AG, paige, jbrand. Sloan also has great fashion jewerly - shelves brimming with jewelry in every shape, size, and style, mostly arranged by color so it's easy to shop.   Also, Sloan is really trying to establish an affordable cocktail, special occasion and prom business upstairs in their store.  Prices range from $300 to $500 and best of all, they have a dress registry so you don't see your great dress on someone else at the same party.  Genius!"
"Lois no longer works here, but I hear the food is still good...."
"First off, Brake shops are probably the biggest rip-off going. I bought all the parts here and changed them myself, saving over $100 bucks at least...."
"I highly recommend Dinner here.  I had been here a long time ago for Dim-Sum and was not that impressed.  I was not buying tonight so I had no choice to go for Dinner, and what a difference it makes.  The Hot and Sour soup was among the best that I have had.  The dishes were brought out as ready and all of the dishes were fresh, one better than the next.  The best was the Roasted Duck.  Highly recommend it - careful as it is easily enough for 4.  At $31 seems expensive but well worth every penny."
"Your basic run of the mill Arby's nothing really stood out for me. The service was good, the food was hot and delicious. I wasn't disappointed, just wasn't wow'd by any aspect. \n\nPros: Close to my home, good service, food was hot and fresh. \n\ncan't say anything for the interior of the restaurant as I went through the drive through.\n\nNOTE: They are giving 15% off military discount for an undetermined amount of time"
"Very good sushi. One of the best places in town. \nIt is bit overpriced. Atmosphere is very trendy, but we have been coming here for years, so we are used to it. \nWe get annoyed when the music is turned up way too loud. Can feel some tension between the owners- they are both on the floor overseeing the business. The woman owner is sweet, but acts like a star and thinks people come there to perform. Really, we don't..."
Excellent vegetarian Indian food. Everything we had was really good. \n\nI was dining there with my wife and we had to laugh when as it got later and darker inside from lack of sunlight they turned the lights up brighter. The opposite of what usually happens at restaurants. The bright lights and white walls took away from an intimate dining experience and the service isn't very good. But go for the food!
"""I came out of my apartment only to find my car dead. I called roadside service and after an hour a tech came out gave me a jump. He recommended that I take it to a service center to get the battery checked. I went to Tire Kingdom and they promptly came out and checked the battery. At first, I was not sure if they knew what they were doing as they wanted to check the battery in the back. I thought they wanted to check the \""""hybrid battery\"""" which did not make any sense to me. It turns out the the regular battery is located right next to the \""""hybrid\"""" battery. They were very polite to me even though I did not know what I was talking about. \n\nThey could have charged me for a new battery, that I did not need based on my ignorance. I am happy to report that they did not take advantage of me in my time of need. \n\nThanks again."""
"You get what you pay for. At 8 dollars for lunch, I don't really mind the oily fried food because, for the same price, you could get oily fried food from Mcdonalds or Panda. However the food here tastes much better than fast food. \n\nI tend to pick and choose the items i know are good, which are the Chinese donuts, string bean, crawfish, and fish. The fresh fruit looked standard as well. Every time i go to Buffet@Asia I am neither pleasantly surprises nor disappointed. I always get what I expect - greasy Chinese food, crowded dining areas, and quick but curt service."
"I was always a bit hesitant about going into Rubin's thinking that I would not be able to afford anything. \nThe other day I ventured into their Monona clearance store and not only were the prices great but they had a ton of random awesome furniture.  All of it seemed to be of very high quality. All of the designs were way different than most furniture stores around, very modern, simple, clean lines. etc...\nThe sales guy was great too, he knew a ton of info on each piece there. We bought a white leatherish futon for $299. They actually had them in stock so we did not have to buy the floor model. \nI love what we bought, it fits perfectly in the room, and seems to be made really well.\nI will def be back shopping at Rubins."
"Killroys! THE FUCKING BOMB....\nBut Songo's bought it, it's closed ATM and makes me very sad! Bring BACK Pam, Chris and JoJo!!!!"
"""The saying \""""don't judge a book by its cover\"""" works both ways. A beautifuly decorated, squeaky clean establishment located in the most upscale and \""""safe\"""" area... doesn't always equal great food. I live in chandler but being a true Vietnamese, I will make the drive to this place for a taste of home. The rich flavorful pho itself is what I crave for most and they never disappoint. If you're the type that eats with your eyes and needs to break the piggy just for a meal to feel like what you ate was good then by all means come to chandler for your viet food fix. For those who truly know and appreciate what Vietnamese food should taste like in any environment...I highly recommend this mom/pop joint."""
Great Malaysian/Thai food. \nJust about everything is goof on the menu.\nI prefer here over Lotus of Siam... I think Lotus is overrated....\n\nKOMOL!!!!!!
"Every once in a while, you just need to enjoy good southern cooking.\n\nI was taken to Lo-lo's while visiting Phoenix.\n\nThe Sweet Tea is served in a mason jar and comes with a diabetic attack. I had the Betty Bop - fried chicken breast and waffle. The waffle was really the stand out portion of the meal, but the two did work together.\n\nYou don't have to get the chicken and waffle combo. But come on, don't be like that.\n\nWe went Friday before lunch, and we were sitting and eating in 10 minutes, but from the looks of the other reviews, that isn't normal."
"If I were rich, I'd spend a shocking amount of my money on natural foods and herbs and body cleansers and other organic happy hippy horseshit...Alas, I'm not, so I kind of wander around the Natural Marketplace wide-eyed as a kid in a toy store. \n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, and they have every natural remedy, vitamin, or herbal concoction you've ever wanted. I'm a fan of herbal teas, and they have a nice selection as well. It's way better than the GNC around the corner in the Arboretum."
"GREAT service, friendly staff, all-around exceptional experience.\n\nSome half-blind ding-a-ling ran a stop sign and caused me to crush my bumper on his dumbass Hyundai. DC and the staff at American Auto Body took care of me from start to finish -- they arranged a rental car, had the rental place come pick me up, and took care of my repairs while keeping me informed of the progress. They even communicated with the dign-a-ling's insurance, to make sure they were admitting liability.\n\nI really can't say enough positive things about this place. If you need a body shop, check them out!!!"
the seabass was awesome but slow service
"""In one week I encountered these DELISH pastries three times as multiple coworkers brought them in and told me \""""Oh you must go to Jean-Marc!\""""   So I grabbed my partner in crime and we made our way there.  Literally packed on a Saturday morning 9 am and we left with a BIG BOX:  \n\nMy favorite- VANILLA CREAM CROISSANT. \n\nHis favorite CHOCOLATE CROISSANT.\n\nOthers- CHOCOLATE BRIOCHE, a special order he just happened to have when my boss went one morning.  SO GOOD.  \n\nIn addition to all the yummy pastries, the place is adorable, tucked into Millvale, with a quaint storefront, and the French accent of Jean-Marc there to greet you."""
"I've been to a few bicycle shops and the Landis at the Indian School location just seems like they're the professionals.  With no need to be pushy, or shady in dealings.  They have a rack full of misc. items on clearance: forks, oil, chains, helmets, all sorts of various parts.\n\nThey also have a good lineup of bicycles and all the other gear that goes with bicycling.\n\nThe protection equipment I picked up was the exact same price as the internet price.  I'll go to them for tune ups, truing, etc...  \n\nI've dealt with bad bicycle shops and unknowing employees before - when it comes to bicycles - it is best to stick with the people that know and that are knowledgeable."
"Excellent service and the hotel is great.  Staying at the governor's club is what made this experience even better.  \nThe only bad thing about it is the shuttle management if you are staying here for Epic.  There were many people going to Epic during my stay and there was only two shuttles available, leaving several people behind on the first trip to and from Epic."
"I do not know why yelp has marked this place as closed but all I know is I had the best pancit here just this weekend! It was loaded with shrimps, chicken, pork and lechon? I actually cannot get over it upto now. Even they're lumpia is super good too! Definitely coming back! Friendly service and good filipino food hmmm yummmm :)"
"Fast and tasty sandwiches, good baked goods and soups, and a wide array of micro-brew-y beverages.\n\nThat said, their occasional live entertainment can be irritatingly faux-Joanna Newsom-y."
"This Squirrel Hill location is now closed. But don't worry, Pamela's is still in the neighborhood, just around the corner. Same food (in other words, same delicious strawberry hotcakes), same service.\n\nFor the new location's Yelp page go here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/pamelas-upstreet-pittsburgh#hrid:ALHFycq2Qx3_9E3Mw2MSnQ/\n\nMy major issue with this old Forbes Ave location was how the tables were so tightly crowded together. Even though I'm not a big-hipped girl, I was always worried I'd knock someone's eggs or hash off their table as I passed. Happily, this is less of a danger at the more spacious new location."
"Thought the politics leave something to be desired, you should still go to Chick-Fil-A.  This location was clean, service was friendly and we went when almost no one was there.  \n\nConsistent with the Chick-Fil-A experience that converts have come to know & love."
"""Do NOT plug the 1220 Grandview Ave address into your GPS and expect to get there.  Yes, that's exactly what I did and was lead up the mountain.  Use 1197 West Carson Street, Pittsburgh PA 15219 instead.  \n\nThe view is nice, but I'm not so sure about \""""the second most beautiful view in America\"""" title.  Definitely worth the 2.75 RT ride."""
"""im review 100! yea! well i dont know why i didnt write this review a long time ago these guys are awesome their prices are the best by far trust me! i live right outside of summerlin and everywhere else wants some bs \""""out of bounds\"""" charge.  Well you know vegas is great for making up horrible terms for things that dont make sense so they can over charge But then again people are so dumb they dont ask they just pay! (and its not because they just have the money look at the housing market lol)  I used them to take me to the airport for an early morn flight they were on time professional great i also used the on st pattys day again everyone had a great time i have used many limo companys in the past but this is my first go to because i dont have to get under the table rides to get a good price (not that i would ever do that!) and their drivers are awesome!"""
"Precision Tune is my preferred mechanic in Charlotte. They have always been helpful, friendly, and best of all HONEST with me. I have never gotten the sense they are overcharging me - usually they will actually SHOW me the part that needs repaired so I can see for myself its condition if they suggest something I didn't think I needed. Usually if I need more than one thing completed they will bundle it to give me the best discount or throw in a freebie. One time I had to leave my car there for the day and the manager personally gave me a ride to my nearby work site because he was going out that way for errands. He was polite, professional, and easy to talk to. I've been to a few other places in Charlotte like Tire Kingdom (horror story), Chevy Dealership (meh), and some smaller mechanics (were outright lied to) - none of them compare to Precision Tune."
I never would have known about this great ice cream except for a friend who was showing us around his old campus. When asked if we wanted ice cream I mistakenly said no way. But I am so glad I changed my mind.\n\nRight when you walk in you are overcome with the aroma of the homemade waffle cones. It smells really good! They have about ten flavors and everything is homemade. You can sample as many of them before you make your choice. I choose the cookies and cream. It was really good. But I have to say the waffle cone smells better than it tastes. It kind of tastes too sweet and a bit like orange. At the bottom of the cone you will find a M&M surprise! (It stops the ice cream from leaking out the end).
"THIS PLACE IS small. REALLY REALLY small.  Good thing theyr'e planning to build a new one.\n\nI got take out and drove 20 minutes back to work.  Not Good.  My stomach was growling at me - loud enough I could focus on nothing else.  They gave me melted butter, hot sauce & syrup with my chicken & waffle.  I'm so full right now.  Fat & Happy.  Very very happy."
"We came here on a sunday night before closing, 9pm. They discounted our meal bc after 9 the chefs stop cooking. 2 AYCE (14 each) + free Soda for 28 (usually $14.99+1.29) \n\n- Salmon, octopus and eel nigiri were there. fish pieces were fair size.\n- I love soups. their wanton soup, egg soup, and hot and sour soups were pretty good. still hot.\n- crab legs and lobster were a bit flavorless. shells were soft. expected for a $15 buffet.\n- must flavor own oysters! O___O\n- other items i ate: potstickers, cream cheese wantons, orange chicken, salt and pepper dungeness, shrimp and mushrooms, \n- desserts didn't look appetizing, but then again, i don't care much for them at an asian buffet. \n- i appreciate that they discounted our meal. kind service. gave us extra drinks and lots of napkins in advance."
Positives:  Right in the heart of everything. \nNegs:  Right in the heart of everything.\n\nClean enough and a bit dated but who goes to Madison to stay in the room? (although I don't want to think about the history of the towels I used).  So if drinking and partying and drinking more and listening to other people outside doing the same is what you are looking for... this room is great especially when you consider you will be blacked out within a few hours of check in.
"The pizza ranks among the absolute best in town if you like thin crust, extra cheesy, flavorful sauce pizza.\n\nI'd only ever get it plain or maybe once in a blue moon with pepperoni.\n\nAnd I don't get anything else.  The fact that it's cash only is a downer, but not enough to drop it from 5 stars.\n\nSeriously, if you like cheesy pizza, you can not find a better place than Mineos."
"Haven't been here in a few years, and still pretty good! Prices were a bit much from what I remember, and there wasn't much to choose from on the menu.\n\nI ordered some short ribs, being the classy bitch I am. I got some big ball of meat smothered in peppers which was fuckin delish. And only 17 dollars. I recommend that to anyone who goes to this place, it's the best. It wasn't till I was halfway through this juicy rib slab that I remembered I was a vegan. Oops. So much for that new years resolution.\n\nThe staff is super friendly and even engaged in some interesting conversation with us, since it was pretty late and the place was practically empty.\n\nMy only complaint is that they put bacon on the mashed potatoes. Potatoes are the food of gods but I HATE BACON STRIPS AND BACON STRIPS"
"I have used Gates on two separate occasions and would never consider bringing my car anywhere else.  The staff is friendly and professional.  They are very quick to get your car in for an inspection and also the repair.  Their rates are on par or lower than other places I took my car, and most of their work comes with a lifetime warranty.  Do not go anywhere!"
"This place is the dietary downfall of many students and Champaign-Urbana residents.  I never had enough time during intermissions to properly savor the cakes, eclairs, pies and coffees, so we would sometimes go even if we weren't attending a performance.  I don't think it's even freshly made, but the endless dessert possibilities will impress."
The specials are ongoing and the food is to die for. The waitstaff is very attentive. They are quick to exchange orders if the food does not meet up with our tastes. Not their fault. I was not aware how spicy it would be and could not eat it. They were very understanding. I don't go on holidays or during busy hours so the wait if any has never been more than 10 min.
"See, all my friends but one hate this place. I always beg and plead for Mi Patio, but no one ever wants to go. The complaint is always the same, that the food tastes like soap most of the time. \n\nAnd then it dawned on me.\n\nThe only other person who likes this place as much as I do usually also leaves as tanked as I do.\n\nThe $1.25 margaritas mentioned before absolutely do their trick.\n\nCall me a boozebag, call me easily distracted, but I loooove Mi Patio."
"We finally went here! I wish we had gone sooner, because we were desperate for sushi in Madison.\n\nDerek got teriyaki chicken, which he didn't like very much. He also got the Cathy roll which he loved. I got the autumn roll, which I also loved ... Finally, an INTERESTING vegetarian roll! (in Madison, it's either avocado, asparagus, cucumber, or veggie tempura ... Berkeley actually knew how to work with veggies in sushi!) It's pumpkin, avocado, and cream cheese. It had a great mild flavor; I loved the combo of pumpkin and avocado. I also got the asparagus roll which was good, but nothing special.\n\nIt was pretty dead today at lunch so it was surprising how long it took for us to get our food, but it was fine. I don't think we'll ever go for dinner because I like the lunch special."
"Half price wine on Mondays...order a salad and pizza for a budget night out or look for Groupons that seem to come every few months.\n\nThe rest of their menu is certainly good, but for the price they are not my favorites. \n\nGreat wine list!...as should be expected."
"2 years ago I took my husband's Movado here to get the battery replaced and the clasp fixed as a last minute Christmas gift.  I didn't expect it to be finished before Christmas but they had it back to me in 2 or 3 days, and polished for only $15!  I haven't been there recently but I would think that their level of service and workmanship are still the same."
"So to be honest, I didn't even know if there were shoe repair places around anymore; but Cecil's is the best. They are always fast and do a great job. I took two separate pairs of boots to Cecil's with broken zippers and booth were fixed like new in less then a week. They also have very good pricing."
"I found this place by accident one day I wasn't feeling well and wanted soup...I think this place sells the next best thing to Jewish penicillin...chicken soup. There's was a seafood pho, I took mine to go like I said cause I was sick got home combined the broth with the submersibles and got into the zone. Made some for my son who as an almost adult can get finickie but he inhaled his as well."
"5 stars for Carry-out! Only 1 star for dining inside.  Young Chinese guy real drab and bored at the counter, he kept clipping his fingernails on top the counter, gave us real cheap flimsy plastic forks that kept breaking off in our mouths, saw 3 flies swarming around, all the employees talk and yell really loud at each other in screeching Chinese very loud and ignorant , good food though for taking home and eating! They don't serve Ice with drinks and don't have any ice....."
"I would give this one a 3.5 or a 3.75....It's a neat little setting in the basement, below Husnu's, I think....nice art on the walls. Their house salad, I have to say, was the most boring thing ever....lettuce leaves drizzled in some olive oil. period. \n\nSome of their entrees are good. I like the peanut chicken stew....i think few of their entrees can be repetitive....different meats but similar sauce/preparation....I would have liked to see some creativity in there!....\n\nThe injera (bread) is a bit too sour for my taste and it overpowers the flavor of your stew...go with the rice.\n\nThe 2 hot sauces are really good, though....ask for them.\n\nAll in all, good comfort food on a cold winter evening.....but didn't bow me away...\n\nBtw, they have a cart in Henry mall during lunchtime and have several of the same entrees that they have for dinner....so I'd just try those out to see you're into their food."
This place is great has it's off and on nights Just make sure to ask for Anthony to cook and Greg as a waiter and you will enjoy ! Came last night and horrible waitress and food wasn't as good .
"Read great reviews about this place so I thought I'd give it a try. \n\nI have a beloved pair of tall flat black boots that I haven't been able to part with or replace (believe me, I've tried). I decided to take these in to see what magic could be worked on these since I've been embarrassed to wear them. They were faded, heel sole uneven, and the stitching was starting to come undone near the zipper. I dropped them off and it only was going to take 4 days for them to be repaired. I got them back today and they looked like new! Obviously there's still some wear lines in the leather but they had resoled, dyed, and restitched the zipper and for a little over $20. Definitely worth a try for anyone looking for minor or major repairs."
"At first, I was a bit sketched out by the entrance of the restaurant. One of the servers was smoking a e-hooka and then there were a bunch of guys standing outside with motorcycles parked by the restaurants chatting and looking all rugged. After going inside, the restaurant is actually pretty spacious, unlike most pho places on central ave, which are pretty cramped. \n\nThe server is decent, not overtly rude like a lot of pho places, she even came back to ask how the food was. This place never looks very packed to me, I drove by on multiple occasions. \n\nYou can substitute egg noodles for pho noodle for an extra 50 cent. The quality of the dishes here are decent. I'd say 4/5. Price wise, a bit higher than other pho places around."
"Had a Top End handcycle repaired here after it had sat in the weather for two seasons, they fixed it up perfectly - replaced a nonstandard chain, trued up the wheels and replaced skins, and even fixed a failing shimano shifter that had been badly abused to the point where it's working fine now after two more years. Total cost was very reasonable for what I needed done, I would definitely use their services again."
"This is the best pizza I have ever had in my life. I've had pizza in NYC (lived there in my youth), Italy, Chicago, you name it, I've hit up the big pizza places.\n\nThis is by far the best pizza I have ever had in my life. I've been vegetarian for over three years and I still dream about their pepperoni pizza and desperately crave it.\n\nA word to the wise. There is no fricken ambiance in this facility. But who the hell asks for ambiance from a pizza joint?\n\nHell, maybe the next time I am in Pittsburgh I will give up giving up meat to eat a pepperoni pie here.\n\nCan you get a better endorsement than that? I think not. Go and enjoy the pizza, save some of your crust to dip in the oil that is left. This isn't a health conscious pizza place, but who eats pizza for their health? Splurge and enjoy!"
"Oh Herro beautiful Coach bag!\n\nAhhhh how I love Coach! Alas Im usually a broke azz bish or just wayyy too cheap! This day I went in and was given a 30% off coupon! Plus they took off 10% off the total after the first coupon then another 10% off in addition to the 50% off original price of my clearance bag! Its weird how they do it but whatever, I got a 268$ purse for 57$!!\n\nIts a large store, but beware of the clearance area! Bishes be crazy! You have to basically grab whatever you can then actually look at it in the safety of a corner or be ready to shank someone so they dont take it away from you! LOL JK! But they are out for blood! Anywho, they have a ton of employees around with their little calculators and are ready to assist you! Just remember, stand your ground! LOL.\n\nStore is clean, organized by color and season, and theres a huge line for more than 3 and less than 3 items! SCHWING! Ill be back this Thursday or Friday to see what else I can score!\n\nGo check out the clearance section first!"
"""This place is definitely one of my favorite places to frequent. I try to come at least once or twice every other month. I'm a huge people watcher and just like the other reviews mentioned, it is full of some fratty dudes. Boat shoes, khakis, light blue button up shirts and shades around the neck is a normal look around here. I can't seem to avoid going to places that are fratty, but it's all good. They're just worried about beers and hanging with their \""""bros\"""". Our waitress had a bad case of ADD, but she was still a sweetheart and she was fun. Tons of good looking/classy appearing ladies (if that's what you're into). The inside gets pretty crowded fast, so I try to get some seating somewhere in their awesome outside seating area. Tons of TVs to watch sporting events, food is pretty good as well. On Bobcats game nights, pizzas are half price (or at least they used to be). Overall, love the place and will continue to stop on in whenever I can"""
It went out of business
"Went for brunch this morning with a group.  They take reservations and sat us on time.  The wait staff in general looked tired and possibly hungover, but if I was 10 years younger and without children, I probably would be too on a Sunday morning.  At any rate, they got the job done.\n\nThey offered a nice array of breakfast drinks. The Bloody Marys were adequately garnished.  I opted for the blueberry bacon pancakes.  Normally I am a bit of bacon purist and prefer my bacon on the side, but I was pleasantly surprised by the combination.\n\nMany of the other brunch entrees looked quite appetizing, and if I go back, I would likely order one of the more Mexican dishes."
"""I will get pizza here over Mineo's any day. \n\nI say that because the people who work here are soooo nice. Not to mention the pizza is good too. Of course there is heavy comp between the two joints just because of location. Not sure if the rude arrogant attitude of all workers at Mineo's is because they always get rated \""""best pizza\"""" but all I know is no pizza is THAT good. They have zero kids options. Which brings me back to Aiellos. They have a decent menu and like I said they are sooo so nice in there. \n\nNeither place delivers, so if you're going out to get pizza anyways... Do yourself a favor and just go to Aiellos"""
"Walked over here after having thai for dinner the other night.  Honestly, I didn't even know there was a B&Js here just because I probably drive way too fast down Providence trying to get to places [and also avoid Queens and Queens like the plague!].\n\nThe servers were friendly and nice.  It was a slow night, but I got my waffle cone filled with strawberry cheesecake goodness pretty quickly.\n\nThere are a number of tables to sit inside... and a couple tables out - since it was nice out, we decided on the latter... the table was dirty from previous customers... but that was my only complaint.  Overall it was a good Ben and Jerry's experience in a store I had never been in before."
"This place gets 4 stars because they deliver.  Wolfman offers a large selection of original pizzas, most of which are very tasty.  The one thing I will say about their pizza is that I don't love their crust or their pizza sauce, but at least half of the specialty pizzas come with an alternative sauce- I recommend the Greek pizza and the Thai chicken pizza.  The pizza is very yummy when it's hot, but it doesn't seem to keep all that well (it can be very juicy).  The salads are all great too, but I haven't been impressed by their pasta.\n\nUPDATE- every time I order delivery pizza they mess up the order, the pizza is great, but how hard is it to get an order right??"
"I never thought I would write a review about a mall, after going to malls for years, but today I felt it right. After the flooding , and losing a few stores in the mall, they seem to be coming back. Parking has never been an issue, as I choose to head to the top floor of the deck. Once inside, too many options to write about, but they have everything from a food court to restaurants, department stores, standard to upscale, and so many stores, offering a variety of options for every shopper. Although it can get crowded at times, this is my mall of choice."
Seriously so super fresh! Their sashimi is melt in your mouth goodness! But with all this AYCE available out there I just feel like this place is pretty expensive.
"Finally a bar where I don't feel out of place! \nLots of different mixes of people, not full of loud frat boys, very dim lighting, cheap!\nThe bartenders didn't give a sh** like everyone has been saying, but I LIKE it. They aren't putting on any fake masks, just being themselves; which are super tough women. You gotta be that way based on the clientele present before all the young kids come in. \nSuper cool place where you can be part of the crowd or just chat with a friend or two."
Crazy Jim's is wonderful. I called for a delivery order and the person on the other end (I think his name is George) was concerned that his delivery guy wouldn't be able to make it by the time I needed. George was very accomadating and up front. The best part? The order arrived 30 minutes BEFORE I was expecting it. Great customer service and the food is great as well.
"""I'd been to plenty of other places in Charlotte before I found Almar Auto. Since I found them, I haven't gone anywhere else.\n\nOk I'm a girl- so being friendly and explaining whats going on with my car is important to me. They are not only friendly, but knowledgeable. They always diagnosed the problems with my ten year old car and fixed it as they said.\n\nI'd even shown them receipts from past work done and they smiled and said \""""oh, wow- thats a lot. We can do better every time.\""""  And they did."""
Service was great. Liked the meat jun but beef slices had too much gristle for me. Will be back though.
"The outside of this restaurant has always prevented me from going in. However, it was awesome. I didn't get steak - I got the venison and a cheese plate appetizer. It was all delicious.\n\nService: Wonderful. My waitress was very very friendly and attentive.\nEnvironment: A little bit woodsy, but cozy. Dark (like all steak houses). And I like that it's made up of lots of different small rooms rather than one large dining area."
"I little piece of Monroe street that doesn't get much attention. Sure, they're small, but they have everything you need for on-the-go relief for chapped lips, sniffles, or a pounding headache. PLUS, it's a local neighborhood-y alternative to Walgreen's.\n\nMy favorite this is that they've got a Post Office inside the Pharm, so you can stop by and grab stamps or mail a package without trekking to an official USPS location. Plus, the staff is uber friendly and they sell lotsa candy ;)"
"I chuckle to myself (and to my co-workers) when I wait in the Disney-like line at Original Hamburger Works.  We all frantically discuss what we want and if we can have a bit of their this or that---- I'll get this, you get that, then we'll share and then let's get fries, oh wait, maybe Onion rings- or both and then I want a large drink right? or is this the place with the massive drinks?  Maybe I'll get a smaller one-- oh, hell- I'll get a large one and a mushroom burger and fries and onion ring and I'll load up an entire extra plate of condiments and stuff my face with pickles until they call my name.  \n\nSo this is what it is like at the Works for me--- can't you see why so much love? \n\nThe chicken strip are disappointing though, get a burger. \n\nP.S. 4 out 6 times here-- there have been a group of firemen eating there too--- yummo."
"I haven't been here in about 10 years! This place has changed so much. I love it though. I trusted all the Yelp reviews and tried the Herbal Salad. You know, I'm Thai so I was like what is this crap?! I speak Thai! Totally kidding, sort of. It was good, except there was way too much shredded coconut. Other than that, I liked it. I felt really bad for the server though because my family was harsh and he seemed like he was the only one there. My family, although I love them, does not know how to act properly in a restaurant. I seriously think that they like torturing the workers with ridiculous requests sometimes. Anyways, the food was good and I will definitely be back for more. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have the lemongrass juice though. Eh, whatever."
"""Nothing, oh nothing beats the Desayuno Regular (regular breakfast) at El Pulgarcito.  \n\nEach time I find myself sitting behind the menu, I look at the Desayuno and think, \""""oh I'm much hungrier than that, and it looks so boring and bland\"""" but I order it anyway and when it comes to the table I have to restrain myself from licking the plate every time ;)  Just trust me.  And 5.95 is a steal!  \n\nI've also had the tamales and papusas as well as the vegetarian burrito (just ask for salsa on the side to give it some edge) and the cilantro shrimp entree.  It's all delicious and I will miss it dearly when we move."""
"Amazing. I never liked Thai food until a friend brought me here. It's kind of a hole in the wall and a bit difficult to find if you're not familiar with the area, but it's so worth the effort to find!! Great lunch specials and great service! The food is definitely a 5 star in my opinion, but there is often a sulfur like smell emanating from the restroom area..."
"I am such a traitor.  I've betrayed Nielsen's Frozen Custard, which is from my hometown, and...I liked it!\n\nUnlike squeaky-clean Nielsen's, Luv-It is so confident in their frozen custard abilities that they just don't give a f*&# about their customers' comfort!\n\nDon't have any cash?  Too bad, go home.  Want seating?  Go sit on the crackhead in the alley.  Afraid of being knifed?  Suck it up.  Luv-It just doesn't care!  \n\nWhile Luv-It doesn't have the amazing Nielsen concrete (truly amazing), they do have awesome sundaes.  My favorites are the western sundae (caramel, hot fudge, vanilla custard, and toasted pecans) and Luv-It sundae (toasted pecans, strawberries, vanilla custard, and a cherry on top).  Their sundaes are the best in LV, in my opinion, and should be tried.\n\nI look forward to betraying Nielsen's many times in the future."
Best F------ Chinese food in vegas. Looks like a Sh*t hole so order delivery or take out. You will NOT be disappointed. AMAZING food. Only problem is today is sunday & I want orange chicken and they are closed on sundays :(
"Breakfast today, it's Omelet house and I got a favorite of mine, the cheese, bacon, and mushroom. We got fast service and the food came nice and hot, but my omelet which had cheddar cheese in it, had way too much cheese and someone had added chicken? \n\nSince I was very specific about bacon, I was surprised to see the chicken. I think that perhaps my order was mixed up with someone Else's, or the server didn't hear me correctly. \n\nIt wasn't that bad, but it was a disappointment that I didn't get my bacon. Since my husband and I often watch our carbs, (we try to go pretty strict) we both got sliced tomato's instead of potatoes. I think they have pretty good potatoes and of course the pumpkin bread, which we did pass on this time, is always good. \n\nThis place is good for breakfast and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good breakfast."
I wish there was a jimmy johns where I live ! But every time I'm in an area where I find one Its always a treat !
"""Excuses isn't the type of place you go to for great food, great drinks, or to show off that new glitter dress you bought for your night at Diesel. It's the little dive bar you simply go to for a good time!\n\nAside from the average food, and smokiness (yes, smoking is permitted), I've never had a bad experience at Excuses. There's often a live band playing, a Pens game on the TV, or some awesomely bad karaoke going down. If you stop in between those \""""events\"""", a solid draft selection and friendly staff will still be there waiting for you.\n\nNow, if I was rating Excuses for it's food alone, it would get three stars. It's average grub, but it's so affordable that if you're expecting something better, your greedy ass deserves to be lathered in hot sauce and licked clean by the dude that runs karaoke...after he works up an appetite from singing his latest Guns N' Roses tune.\n\nGo for the fun times and positive vibe, and when you wake up the next morning smelling like you've been smoking for 25 years, you can reminisce about whatever nonsense you got into the night before at Excuses. Enjoy!"""
"OK, so it is not a place I would go for that romantic weekend.  But when in town on business, it is a smaller hotel, cheap, and rooms are pretty good. \n\nIf you go online, they have room deals that give you coupons - including $25 gift cert for Dan Marinos.  \n\nDan Marinos is not fine dining, but pretty good for a hotel restaurant.  (I recommend the ribs)  The Dam is a great place for breakfast or lunch.  The Hooters Restaurant is the usual (but I dont eat at them anywhere else ...).  \n\nThere is the Bait Shop, where you can get coffee, sandwiches, salads, fruit, etc. quickly and easily.  \n\nThe casino is small, but located down the street from the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd. From there you are at NY/NY, MGM, Excalibur and a tram ride away from Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  And the opening of the monorail makes the corner available to more."
"I'm a big fan of the guys here.  They run a little shop and they like what they do.  I knew my catalytic converter was going bad (it was rattling).  I wanted a high-flow cat and a new muffler.  They knew what I was looking for because they know Jeeps.  I've been there countless times for all sorts of repairs.  Recently they fixed my driveshaft too.  Make no mistake, this isn't a luxury car repair place.  It helps if you know a little bit about your vehicle before you go.  And no, there isn't a waiting room.  So, go walk around China town.  It's a great place."
Great thai in Vegas. Thanks to yelpers for highly recommending this place. Its a small hole in the wall place and located in a dark side of vegas. With the hustle bustle of the sin city this comes as an excellent reasonable delicious find. We ordered Bamboo shoot with veggies in red sauce with Fried Rice and Drunken noodles. The entrees were both excellent. Tasted so good. The separate order of fried rice was screwed up and when we told this to our waiter he was quick to react and remove it off our bill. \n\nThey have a hoard of vegetarian dishes and for once we didn't have to explain our needs to the staff. The reason for four and not five stars is the service was darn slow. It took close to hour and half for our entrees to arrive.
"Absolute hole in the wall serving extremely delicious Laotian-Thai food! \n\nScary interior, dirty water glasses, poor service, but food to die for! \nTry their eggplant and squash curries. \n\nBTW, the food is pretty spicy, so watch out."
"There is no doubt that Baltimore is an epicenter of Jewish life.  This translates to a plethora of shopping options for those keeping kosher.  However, for those who enjoy a partaking in fromage with kosher rennet are out of luck.  The best you can do is a brick of waxy orange Miller's cheddar.\n\nSo, it was to my great delight when my friend took me to Murray Avenue Kosher.  It's not the flashiest of markets, but it certainly has a wide assortment of products for a relatively small Jewish community.  \n\nI bought the following items which I have not yet found in my hometown:\n\nCheddar - England\nBrie - Quebec\nKashkaval - Bulgaria\nOlive tapanade (super hard to find kosher) - Israel\nFig preserves - Israel \nPesto - Israel"
"Their special combo plates (entree+appetizer+drink) may not be the best thing in mankind, but it's pretty damn close.\n\n3 delicious items for $11.99? Shut up and take my money!\n\nAnyways, Bandung is literally amazing. Delicious, delicious food (I'm looking at you, Red Curry Squash and Daging Rendang), extremely affordable prices ($8~12) and enough food to last for days (unless you were really, really hungry like me, in which case, it'd last you a few hours).\n\nOn top of that, it's pretty healthy too.\n\nIf you're still not sold after reading this, then I lose all hope in humanity."
"How can you go wrong in a place where you get your shoes taken off before you enter a lovely tea room that's private and JUST for you and your partner/husband/party.... \n\nThen you get brought this EXTENSIVE sushi list, everything sounding (and subsequently being) more delicious than the next, from the rolls to the entrees.\n\nAs a vegetarian, my knowledge of sushi is limited, but they've got THE BEST tempura ever.  ANd their spinach soy tofu dish is PERFECT, especially given the simplicity of the dish.  It's got the perfect balance of good salty gingery flavour, and the texture is just incredible.\n\nFor those who like the whole hibachi experience, while I've not seen Ginza's in particular (I've been to others on the coast) I can see them flipping their scallops while entering, and it seems like everyone is having a good time.\n\nIt's really fun to be in a personal tea room, IMO, so private, so calm..  such a scrumptious experience..."
"Best shrimp burro's. If it wasn't in the hood & make me cringe @ the thought of going in at night alone, I maybe would have given it 5 stars. \nThe staff is as friendly as any other Mexican spot. The place is kept decently clean. Don't let the outside totally deter you from at least stepping foot in the place. There's a couple TV's playing Mexican music video's to get your mind off of waiting for your order, which is surprisingly fast. Call in orders are necessary when your trying to beat the lunch rush. But any other time, you could be out the door in 10 minutes. \nThis place has been here for a while now. There is other La Salsita spots to go to in the valley. Some tweaked their spelling but all in all, best shrimp burro on this side of Van Buren!"
"The staff are efficient and friendly. They could use an upgrade to their chairs and tables, not the most comfortable setting. Nice place to meet someone for a quick chat. In the winter - the place can be a little too cold to sit and enjoy a leisurely lunch. I don't drink coffee,but the sandwiches and soup are a-1."
"Moving to Las Vegas, one of the first things I had to accomplish was finding a replacement barber shop... obviously really important because I care more about my hair than most people care about their own children.  Luckily I don't have kids... but, I digress.\n\nThe reviews do not lie.  They care a lot about your hair, just like any proper latino barber shop.  Fair prices, I don't go anywhere else in Vegas."
"Perhaps the best pho in Charlotte. Great broth, appreciate their restraint in the use of salt. I usually order the #45 on the adventurer part of the menu.  It contains every meat they use other than tripe; there is a generous amount of beef and tendon. Service may not be Lang Van great, but it is pretty good for an ethnic restaurant. Only gripe on this visit is that the place was cold; hence my pho got cold very quickly. My husband seemed to think that the basil and other garnishes were also too cold and cooled the soup down as well. Even so I finished every drop. There is free wi-fi, but you will need to ask for the  password."
"""I joined my daughter on her trip to PetSmart just to check out their fish department.  Lucky for me, the guy that worked that department knew his fish!  I've been to a local store specializing in fish and tanks, and twice was disappointed with the experience, knowledge, prices, customer service and return policy.  PetSmart has the fish marked for compatibility, and a great return policy.  I ended up buying 2 Bleeding Heart Tetras and 2 Dalmatian Mollys and they are all getting along \""""swimmmingly.\""""  Once in the tank, though, the tiger barb we had started nipping at their tales, so I scooped him up and took him to just drop off at the store.  They were surprised, but we're all content now.  I would go back there for all my fish and supplies. I gave 4 out of 5, though, because a lot of their decorative tank selections were extremely high priced."""
"Not really a lot to say about this location. It's pretty much a par location. Lines aren't ever too bad, staff is courteous, drinks are as expected, free wifi, outdoor seating, free parking and generally plenty of close parking available. Seating inside is adequate and you can generally find a plug for your devices. Nothing to get excited about, but nothing to complain about either."
"First of all there is no smelly cat at this place which is not bad after all.\n\nI asked one of their staff. She said she does not know why the coffee place is named as Smelly Cat.\n\nNever mind! Place is great, well located. Even with my limited knowledge about NODA, I can tell that it is located in the center of the Noda district, if there is any center. Well, there has to be a centre, right? ;-)\n\nCoffee is good, service is nice, staff is friendly. I go here whenever I am in and around NODA district. It's a great place to sit and relax while having a coffee. Sometimes on Sundays it's quite which makes relaxation, reading and browsing internet much more peaceful."
"""I came here looking for something I had never had together: chicken and waffles. The chicken legs were fantastic, but the waffles were so so. Either way, I washed it down with some \""""drank.\"""" LOL! I may come here again, but it won't be for at least a year before I recover from the calorie coma!"""
"Positive \nGreat tasty food. \nGreat for lunch  \nVery fresh food \nSelf serve\nCheap price. \nNegative\nVery old place, need a make over\nMusic too loud"
"Best wings around this area, but the staff are fast to ignore you of you are ordering to go food and don't always answer the phone... I know when kitchens get slow they close a little earlier at times but an hour and half early is a little disappointing and we ended up at sucky buffalo wild wing due to this one night.... Great fried pickles, great wings, for a hole in the wall it's not too shabby.... We will keep getting our wings here but not really going to hang out there ....."
I have never stayed here... Just played and eaten.\n\nGambling - Cheap table limits.  Fun to play a few hands of blackjack for like $3.\n\nFood - $.25 wings from Midnight until 6 AM... need I say more.  For nothing else I recommend cruising over here for a late night snack.  You won't regret it.
"I highly recommend Dr. Long Kevin Diep! I had to see Dr. Diep for a second opinion. A different optometrist gave me such a strong prescription that I got headaches, was told I needed reading glasses, & that I had astigmatism. After seeing Dr. Diep, I got a comfortable prescription strength and that I didn't need reading glasses (I'm only 22), nor do I have astigmatism. I had a hunch that the previous optometrist was just after my money and I was right. Bottom line: You can trust Dr. Diep. His staff is wonderful & friendly. They get you in & out of their asap. They also give free contact solution samples that come with contact lens holder. Even without insurance, contacts exam is just $95. If your looking for a variety of name brand sun/eyeglasses they have it."
"Have been here twice with two different pets. First a stray cat we adopted. He had a sore on his chin and after dental cleaning/X-rays/extraction he's all better. Had bad infection. Dr tampira was great. Kept me updated throughout procedure and just overall has a very caring kind demeanor. Took my doxie a few days ago for dental cleaning. Requested dr tampira. She asked how cat was doing and was very good with our dog. Love this place and will continue to take our pets there. Great care, amazing staff!"
"We stayed at the cosmopolitan. Took a cab to Ronald's on Sunday morning at 9 AM (less traffic). Cost for round trip cab was about 30$ Cost for a dozen donuts ~ 14$.\nThat means we paid 45$ for a dozen of their vegan donuts. \n\nMy wife does not eat eggs, and therefore cannot have most donuts. We used to get donuts from Mighty O's in Seattle when I lived there. Those are made with palm oil, and honestly have a funny aftertaste.\n\nRonald's are hand's down the BEST vegan donuts we have ever had. They taste like their milky/eggy counter parts. My favorite was the apple fritter, which was moist and sinful. The custard filled donut, I could not even tell the filling was made from soy cream. My wife was able to try a bear claw, which she has never had before.\n\nHonestly, the fact that I was willing to pay 45$ for donuts should tell you something. And they made my wife extremly happy. She packed them in her suitcase to take home."
"No one wants to be in the hospital, but I guess it's good to have a great place to go to (when you need to).  Luckily I have not had too much experience being a patient in CMC, but I have visited a lot of people here.\n\nGet ready for a mini-city within itself and having to walk a lot.  I'm sure there is a rhyme and reason for why the hospital is planned out the way it is, but it has just grown so much there are skyways and different parking decks and crazy levels.\n\nThe nice thing about the hospital is the location.... it's located off of Morehead and Kings and there are lots of things to do if you have a loved one in the hospital in terms of walking trails (to Freedom Park) or just a stones throw away from the new Midtown shops and restaurants."
"Yeah, so buying beer in the state of pennsylvania is a shit experience.  Why, why, why, WHY can't they just sell the beer in the LIQUOR STORES?   I don't understand that at all.  \n\nAnyway, I was parked, in, and out with a case of black lager and a blue moon brewmaster's sampler in ASAP, so I'm a happy camper.  I would be happier if going out to buy beer wasn't like a full day's errand, but that's PA's fault, not save-mor's."
"I have taken numerous pieces to Michael for repairs. He does take longer than most but he and his wife,Tina have never been anything but nice to me. They remember my name when I go in and are very personable. If you need it immediately, they are probably not the place to go but I have never been disappointed with his work and his prices are very reasonable."
"I am fan of caffeine... well my body is and I willed myself off caffeine all together my body would definitely make sure I paid the price.\n\nI've used to come to this Starbucks daily when I worked in the area.. that was way back in 2004. I just revisited it this week and it is still just as busy as it used to. This is one of the larger Starbucks and there is ample parking. Because of its side the baristas are not walking all over each other and the drinks come out pretty quick. However there is no drive through at this Starbucks, which is fine by me. There is ample seating inside as well. \n\nI recommend the following drinks:\nPumpkin Spice latte hot ask for an extra pump, it makes it sweeter\nHot White mocha with one pump raspberry.\nThe salty caramel mocha go with a grande or tall size, the venti is too much for this drink."
"Much nicer since the old one burned down and was replaced.  Typical Wendy's, fast &  hot."
Friendly staff; modern rooms; clean and comfy beds; not much of a view.
"My girl Lexi needed some medical attention so I jumped in the car and made it to Las Vegas to bring here to the only place in Las Vegas I trust for animal care. \n\nI showed up early and the staff still got me in without waiting which is nice when you're worried about your pet's health. The vet, happened to be the same one who last treated Lexi in 2008 (back before I moved to California) was just as warm and caring. I especially appreciate how he explains what he's doing and why. \n\nOn a side note - they honored their 10% discount which is awesome as medical care, humans or pets isn't as inexpensive as it used to be. Just ask when you get in and show them their ad via your mobile phone."
"Good food, but some of it seems overpriced. The main attraction here are the crazy tropical cocktails. Lots of unique drinks. I like going here in the winter when its freezing and there's two feet of snow on the ground so I can pretend its summer. \n\nBEWARE: sometimes this place turns into a crazy dancehall party. Not really my thing."
I come here strictly for the menudo. I've had plenty other places but I've never had any that measures up to here.  It's nothing fancy and you can get both red or white.  I've been coming here for years and I'm never disappointed.
"Trying tis place for the first time....they get five stares.   Wide variety on menu, plus build your own.  If some one in your group doesn't want pizza, they have variety of other items also.   \n\nStaff is professional, and pizza is great.  One of the best I have had since I moved up here."
"Rita's offers some great menu choices. Menudo is not one of them. \nBut seeing how most people detest the thought of eating cooked bovine stomach, I can't see how this qualifies as any sort of problem.\nOh, they don't serve Coke products either. \n\nBeing a south Phoenix native and a menudo aficionado, I'm uniquely qualified to discern good menudo from bad menudo. This is definitely a bad recipe. \nThe broth has too much of a tomato base and tastes weird.\nThe tripe is overcooked and flubbery. \nOverall, it's pretty disgusting.\n\nSo if you're having a weird day, with a penchant for menudo and a caffeine free diet Coke, forget it. \nInstead, have an ice cold Pepsi and a green chili burrito. \nTry their chips and salsa too.\n\nFour stars for the server's gigantic hangers. \nOverall, Rita's is a good restaurant but their menudo does suck balls."
"I wasn't planning on having my baby there... but I did and it ended up being great.\n\nAt my 38 week appointment; my blood pressure was high so I was sent to the hospital for  tests. \n\nMy doctor suggest Mountain View because he liked the nursing staff. I totally agree. \n\nI got to the hospital at 4pm, Thursday. There was protein in my urine and elevated blood pressure; so by 6pm I was being induced. I had a C-section at 8am Friday morning.  It was my first baby and I really cannot believe how little pain there was.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because of the billing department. They doubled billed me on several things and reported to collections. So they damaged my credit; but they took wonderful care of my son and me."
"""This bar has a good selection of drinks, and nice bar tenders. The only bad thing about this place is it is so skinny that you almost miss it. It is a small long place and the stage is at the back of the venue. The concerts are recorded for the bands if they want a copy of the show which rocks and the bands that play here always come back so i recommend it to anyone looking for a local place to play or see live bands in Vegas! \""""PAN\"""""""
"Please everyone, if you are in Phoenix, AZ you must eat the fried chicken here. Holy smokes is the skin crispy and flavorful! Doesn't feel heavy at all...I should have ordered some to go :/"
"Why would you rate a Bojangles? Well-I have never had a friendlier staff in one of these types of restaurants. It is fast-food with more than a smile. The service was quick and the order correct!\n\nThe biscuits are fabulous! Slight spice to the breading on the chicken-not too much. The cole-slaw was good. The mashed potatoes and gravy were okay-I'll go for something else next trip!\n\nClean, fast and cheap if that is what you looking for!"
"Staff is soooooooooooooooo nice.  After transplanting from AZ to WI, my allergies are going haywire.  Went in looking for Manuka Honey which is supposed to alleviate symptoms but was steered towards their extensive bee pollen section instead.  Am truly hopeful this will alleviate things but appreciated the nudge towards alternative products as well.  Plus I really liked that someone was continuously asking if I needed assistance at every turn."
"I actually worked for Omega Sports for a little over six months back in 2004 and to this day I know more about sporting goods than the average sporting goods store employee. What most people don't know about Omega is that they do a great job of training and testing their employees on the technical aspects of sporting goods. Especially when it comes to shoes and how different shoes address different foot problems. Omega is like a specialty running shoe store that's more interested in finding the perfect shoe for a person than in making as much money as they can off of a customer. The only reason I don't give them four stars is that the education and testing is not a requirement for employees, so you have to make sure that you speak to someone who is properly trained. Just ask for Tony Weaver and you should be all set."
"""We have a serious lack of any Polish places in Vegas, this felt like my old neighborhood Deli back in Chicago.

Came in 20 minutes ago complaining of vibration throughout the car and an intense Right wheel pull on the steering wheel; left in 15 minutes with a new tire and no vibration.  Thanks guys!  \n\n* I would highly recommend this location!
"The staff and doctors here are excellent. My doggies just got in a little argument, resulting in one getting his eye scratched. I called and they were happy to fit me right in! I was pretty upset , and not only did Dr. Paul do a great job with my little guy, she made me feel much better too!\n\nWe have boarded our dogs here many times, and have been happy with the care they received, they are always excited when we pull up and they realize where we are. I have also had their teeth cleaned here for about 3 years now, i love the print out they give you with before and after pictures. We have seen several of the doctors here, and I have no complaints."
I had to write about this place because after two months I still crave the new York strip I had. I expected nothing going into this place.....I had a groupon so decided to check it out. Very laid back old school place.....not like the stuffy chain steakhouses around town. Anyway the cheddar spread reminded me of my grandma but in a good way. Then came the new York strip I ordered. Wow.......perfect char on the outside perfect medium on the inside. So good I swear it was sprinkled with crack. Ate it all......and still think about it constantly. Buttery delicious and I'm not even a big fan of red meat! Got to check it out!
"I normally do not review big chains such as Outback but they did an exceptional job on Sunday.\n\nWe wanted sushi but every sushi spot was either closed or didn't open until 5. We just wanted a light meal since we had purchased steaks to grill in the evening. Low and behold we end up at Outback's bar for apps. I ordered a side salad and we split the cheese fries. The fries were pretty killer. They were layered with ooey gooey cheese and perfectly cooked bacon. \n\nWhat really sets outback apart is the service. Adam our bartender was fabulous! When we mentioned we were on the hunt for sushi he brought out a complimentary sampling of their seared tuna rare and it was shockingly delicious ( I may have to get that on a salad next time). Adam made the visit great, he asked us questions, shook our hands, and did a great job with recommendations (i.e order your cheese fries layered...you will never encounter a spare fry sans cheese). I must say overall he was one of the best bartenders I've had in Charlotte and he deserves to be recognized!"
"It's tiny and dingy, but they sell everything you'd need to make a Thai curry. Or whatever Asian dish you're trying to make. Their produce is also a lot cheaper than other grocery stores in the area. The only downside is their tiny parking lot with the 30 min. parking."
"I was shocked to see the low ratings about First Watch.  We have been here dozens of times and the food and service have always been top notch.  It is consistently great.  I will continue to support this great breakfast and lunch spot.  Special recognition to the servers-everyone is so friendly, positive and laid back."
I have been going to Dr. Boyd for at least fifteen years and I don't know what I would have done without her and Sherri.  When I needed surgery she took care of me and went the extra mile to help me handle prior problems that had made life a little difficult for me.  She always spent the extra time to speak with me regarding any concerns I may have had.  I am truly grateful for her and for her right arm. Sherri
"I hadn't been to a tanning bed in 7 years but figured I needed a base tan before heading out on a tropical vacation.  No high pressure sales (which I was expecting from prior experiences), clean beds, nice staff, excellent pricing and centrally located.  The only negative I can think of is the pricing of the tanning lotions but I think this likely applies to any tanning bed ($40 for a bottle for a one-week tanning experience)."
"I was very satisfied with this visit to Red Lobster.  Typically, the place is crowded, loud, with slow service and orders that are incorrect.  Today, a Sunday, however, was a great day.  Our part of six were seated promptly and our waitress was on the ball.  Our order arrived correct and hot.  Everything was to our satisfaction.  I suppose any Red Lobster location is a hit or miss.  When it's a hit, all is well."
"I can't think of anything that could have been done better. The office is clean, staff is professional, punctual, and friendly, and my root canal was as painless as a root canal can be. The doctor himself made a follow-up call later that day to make sure I was okay. I would absolutely go back to Dr. Fife if I ever need another root canal."
"We called Vegas Plumbing for a kitchen sink leak (which happened on a Saturday, naturally!), and everything went right thereafter:\n\nThe plumber (Carl) came when we were told he would,\nHe was friendly, quickly  sussed out the problem and explained it clearly,\nHe had the necessary part in his truck and installed it promptly, and\nthree hours later there's still no leak, so the job was done right.\n\nWe will definitely call them again and recommend them to everyone in need of a good, honest, conscientious, professional plumber."
"Close enough to the strip to walk if you want of 10 by cab. Felt safe, which in Vegas off strip isn't always the case. Left my top down on the car, only prob in the morning was the yellow Lamborghini parked next to it :)\n\nClean room, quiet, easy check in and super nice staff. AM breakfast manager was helpful. Downside?  Pool was just closed for renovations...in June...really?  Why not January?"
"Been going here for years and outside of the fact that the chairs are not comfy and the table layout is bad, I always love the food.  Last night I tried to go to the New How Lee- too crowded so I walked down the street to Rose Tea and I am glad-  I had Tofu with Basil and a house special call Fish Fillet with cellaphane noodles- both were great- This place likes to liberally throw in the garlic, basil and hot peppers and the taste is not overwhelming but constantly good.  They have a huge selection of teas and serve tall glasses of water."
"I've been coming here for 10 yrs.  Obviously I like it. Food is good. Prices are fair. \nComplaints:  \n          service is normally very good except getting the check (ask for it early)\n          Spicy level I think changes depends on the cook (we like a little spicy but not too much). #2 was more like a #4 once. Kids couldn't eat it. \n\nThat being said, I've never had to send food back or a complaint about cleanliness. That's hard to say these days. \n\nFrom the outside it looks like a dump. I like that because they're often busy."
"Carb-craver's heaven! Pizza, got that. But also breadsticks, garlic knots, garlic bread, house rolls...and we usually start with fries as an appetizer...crispy, golden and hot enough to melt a styrofoam plate.  Breadsticks with garlic and parmesan.  Mmmm. And calzones, wedges--sandwich with pizza crust as bread, gyros and hoagies.  Carb-coma waiting for college students and Penguins fans!  Our go-to spot when gluten-free is not a consideration! \n\nDownside...smokers at the bar and smell wafting to ruin the smell of fresh hot pizza!\n\nBut they do have a full bar."
It was very good.\n\nChicken was tasty but a bit overcooked.\n\nWaffles were phenomenal with a hint of cinnamon.\n\nMac and cheese was perfect along with the home-style fries.\n\nI liked the fact they used mason jars for glasses. That is something I do at home also. \n\nI am still wondering why people are putting up pictures of another location.  Check out my recent upload for what it really looks like outside. It is a tad scary but that just makes me want to investigate even further. \n\nI expected it to be cheaper than it was. Oh well!
"Great doctor, great staff.  I stumbled upon Dr Linker after my previous shifty dentist used up all of my insurance benefits.  Stay tuned for that review!  Anywho, prior dentist told me, the girl with dental floss in her purse and a toothbrush at her desk at work, that I had 'multiple' cavities.  Like a fool I went back to this shifty Dr until finally I wised up.\n\nAnyways, Dr. Linker accepted me as a new patient.  She was very diplomatic in her assessment of my xrays from said shifty dentist.  I felt as if she was really listening to my complaints and provided an unbiased 2nd opinion.  Her office is modern, and all the hygienists and front desk staff are awesome too.\n\nGive Dr. Linker a try - If I had one negative, she doesn't work Fridays and she doesn't take apts later than 3ish.  She's certainly got enough patients to work all 5 days, but appears to be slowing down and enjoying life.  Good for her, I'll just keep coming on my lunch hour."
"I feel badly for Joshua M's experience - I visited Vic's for the first time last week and had a wonderful experience with Vic's.\n\nThey do have a bunch of pre-packaged popcorn available, but when I was there, they definitely had fresh-popped cheddar and caramel corn available, along with a few other varieties.  I was offered complimentary samples of all of the fresh stuff and decided to do the Chicago mix - it was supreme.  Still slightly warm, no signs of grease, and packed with flavor.  Yummo.\n\nI bought a small bag, grabbed a complimentary chocolate (or two), and meandered my way down State Street, munching on Vic's popcorn and enjoying the day. \n\nHopefully the rude guy is gone because from my visit there, I'm a fan of Vic's and would recommend it to others without hesitation."
"Best Chinese delivery I've found in Pittsburgh. Unlike other places - in which the chicken preparations are actually all batter and no respectable pieces of chicken to speak of- the orange chicken, general tsos etc all have very succulent, sizable chicken.  Only complaint is that the general tsos is somewhat lacking in flavor."
"I'm not reviewing an upscale restaurant here but in terms of a car inspection location - South End gets 5.  No one likes the hassle of getting these car exams done but the quickest, friendliest experience I've had is here.  I was done in less than 15 minutes. The waiting room isn't dolled up but it has running AC in the summer; it's clean; and it has a flat panel TV - done.  \n\nThe extra perk is that it is located in a great area for uptown citizens like myself!"
Unlike Los angeles there isint a trader joes on every corner. Took a bit longer to get to this one. The employees were very helpful. I only needed a few items so it was easy. Of course saturday its a bit more crowded but the fact that they have lots of room in this store makes it bearable.The parking is also ample. Again in LA some trader joes are a nightmare with parking and accessibility in the store.Overall pleasant easy experience.
"Stayed here for a night on 4/5/08.  The check-in process was LONG!  Only one clerk to check in about 6 people that were waiting in line.  Plus she had to man the phones as disgruntled customers wanted new bed sheets and other people were called about vacancy and rates.  I stood in line for about 25 minutes before I actually got my room key.  \n\nThere's only 3 floors of this modest hotel, but he elevators were extremely slow!  When we did finally get to our room, it was surprisingly big and clean.  I think holiday inn is trying to market the hotel to make it seem trendy because everything was labelled.  The pillows (firm/soft) and the toiletries (cleanse, freshen, tame, soften).  It was cute, but the products themselves sucked.  Overall.. it wasn't that bad to stay there that night, beds were comfy and good TV selection."
"It looks kind of questionable from the outside, in a seedy strip mall on Sahara. But it's warm, friendly and clean on the inside. I ordered the chicken and ribs combo with roast potatos on the side, and my daughter got the BBQ chicken wrap with cole slaw. The emphasis here is on healthy choices that are tasty rather than tasteless. The rotisserie chicken was delicious and I don't even have to feel guilty.   We'll definitely come back."
"When I travel, I like to find the places where the locals eat. Thanks to Yelp, this is fairly easy to do. No sir, no chains for this Yelper. When in Vegas, eat like the people of Vegas do. Many start their day with Ronald's Donuts, so I had to swing in and see if they stood up to some of my other donut haunts across the US.\n\nGlad this credit card loving guy read the reviews first and noticed it was cash only. I'm also sad that I had to take out a $20 from the ATM, because as soon I walked in and saw the displays and the smells hit my nose, that $20 was done for. It's hard to spend $20 here, but it's doable!\n\nSo, how did it stand up compared to my Indy hometown favorite, Long's Donuts? I'd put these two right about equal, with maybe a tad higher score going to Long's, only because it's my hometown! :) Definitely glad I wandered off the strip for this."
"""Cool atmosphere and decent local craft beer. I had the Cherry Wheat and the ThunderHop IPA which was my favorite out of the two. I hear there pizza is good, but I was traveling solo for business and was not up to the challenge of eating the entire 14\"""" pizza. \n\nOne down side, there wifi connection was weak and went out several times over the two hours I was there."""
"It has a large array of foods to choose from, so if you don't want a gyro that day, you can find something else.  The fries are ok -- they used to serve a lot more than they do now -- but opt for the onion rings."
"ok.  based on beer alone, 5 stars.  service, 3.  the food, no, it's yucky-- don't go here to eat if you're a vegetarian.  the veggie burger tasted good, but the texture was like seared vomit.  vegetarians, stick to pretzels.  on the plus side, if you're local, you can get cases in the business office for cheap during business hours."
"How do they do it?  Huge dining areas, bustling servers, massive quantities of food and it all comes together.  Menu is simple:  fried, deep fried or broiled.\n\nThere are even non-seafood items to satisfy nothing from the ocean eaters, like my wife.  Everyone can find something to eat at Steve's.\n\nTry to come early on peak eating times, like Friday and Saturday nights.  Other nights are not a mob scene.  That said, they do get people seated pretty quick.\n\nAnd if you have people from outside the South, this is a place to show them a uniquely southern experience.  We have taken new-comers, Germans and visitors and everyone enjoys it."
I just found out that this store will be opening at 5am and not 12 midnight like many of their competitors.  Hat's off to American for doing the right thing and allowing their employees to enjoy Thanksgiving.  I up them a star for this and urge others to support them since they know how to properly treat this national holiday.
"""Oddly, I had never eaten at Jamerica until tonight. As an undergrad, I ate plenty of food cart Jamerica. And I may have had it once or twice since I've been back in Madison.\n\nBut now that I live in the \""""neighborhood\"""" I have good access to the Jamerica home base. So tonight when a couple of friends in town suggested it, I was excited. Based on the other reviews, I was expecting a much less inviting atmosphere. I guess it's just very Madison and very Willy Street - warm and colorful decor, friendly service. No frills. \n\nI guess I also wasn't expecting the food to be this good. My jerk chicken was excellent. It was the most flavorful chicken I have tasted in a while, with a generous helping of rice and beans and a side of a sort of cabbage and veggie salad. My husband got their special pork curry stew - also quite tasty. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the meal and would definitely go back. The prices are kind of high but it's a lot of food. If you don't pig out you should definitely have leftovers."""
"Rescued a dog and returned to Happy Dogz for daycare as she has more energy than dog #1.  I explained to the staffer that I used to bring dog #1 but he seemed like he out grew it, I was astounded when staffer, two years after the fact, remembered dog #1 - name, breed and everything!  This is the third dog I've brought to Happy Dogz.  (The original one would sleep for 2 days after a day at Happy Dogz! He has since passed on, sniff).  Dog #1 liked daycare when he was a pup but kind of grew out of it as an adult.  Happy Dogz cares so much about your pet that they will actually tell you if they don't seem to be having a good time, basically telling you not to spend your money! What other business does that? It shows that they are truly invested in your dog being HAPPY, not just taking your money! Excited to see how much dog #2 enjoys it!"
Great lunch menu. Food here is always good but the service can be kind of hit or miss. They had one waitress named Jamie that was probably responsible for drawing in half of their business.
"""A corner stone of state street and wisconsin culinary repertoire.  (please don't call it a hot pocket)\n\nThe meat goes on top.  Meat juices drip on onion.  Meat+Onion juices drip on absorbant potato.  All of it is wrapped in a braided pastry pocket.  Genius!  (and genius that Teddywedgers has spared us the traditional rutabaga.)  \n\nThe pasty stays hot for a long time.  Lore says welsh miners supposedly stuffed these \""""pies\"""" down their shirts to stay warm and ate them for lunch.  (I do not recommend sticking food beneath your underlayers while at work)\n\nAmong the variations they offer, by far my favorite is the breakfast pie (Canadian Bacon, eggs, cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms and Italian sausage).    It is almost so good that I sometimes want to break my grad school routine and wake-up for breakfast."""
"I generally get the falafel for 5 bucks. Really tasty and it makes two meals. The decor is kind of weird, if it were solely a take out place I'd like it even more."
"I have been taking my chihuahua here for a few years now, and I hope I never have to take her anywhere else. Don't let the location put you off. The shopping center is a bit run down looking, but the ladies at A Dog's Best Friend are always warm and friendly and treat my dog like they truly love her. They do an excellent job, and my dog is happy and smells great when I pick her up. Oh, and the price is fantastic!"
"Excellent chai, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. They seem to have some confusion when it comes to French sodas (some of the staff insists on calling them Amalphi sodas, but that's a totally different drink), but regardless of what they call them they're still good."
"While rockin' the 2011 Comicon experience, you can work up quite a hunger.  We decided to get out of the convention center for a bit, and ended up wandering over to Seamus McCaffrey's for a beer with out lunch.\n\nI had a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato, which was the perfect compromise between the grilled cheese and BLT that I was craving.  Kevin had the beef stew, served with fresh soda bread.  Both meals were tasty and filling, and paired with a Kilt Lifter, the perfect lunch.  \n\nThe music was at the right level for the crowd, the service was fast and friendly, and there were a few TV's showing Football (Soccer) but not too many to be distracting or annoying."
"Bathroom stinks.  Juke box is like crack - fun, but it gets expensive FAST.  $1 pool?  BOO.  My entire body can attest that the $4 mini-pitchers (which works out to about two and a half glasses) do what they were made to do.  Heather is awesome, though.  She kinda reminded me of my sister, maybe in a few years."
"vegan donut? really? I couldn't tell the difference.\nI heard about Ronald's Donuts. \nDriving down spring mtn, I saw the sign and had to stop by.\nEven after pass 12p the donuts were pretty tasty."
"After spending a day in Madison, I started making a mental pros/cons list about why boyfriend should apply to UW Madison for law school.  This is one of those pros.  \n\nThis store has so many goodies some of  which are reasonably priced, others of which are not.  Sweet and Sara vegan marshmallows were more expensive than at Whole Foods in Chicago, but other things like the eggs were cheaper than at the co-op I usually go to.  They carry Upton's seitan which is a fave of mine, and a ton of great quality produce.  \n\nIf I lived here, I'd become a member, b/c quite frankly, you really have to to shop here.  10% upcharge for non members.

"Place has seen better days, but at least they've upgraded the sound system."
"Maybe 3.5 stars, but I really loved the cherry scone I got.\n\nThe coffee was like 2 stars. I mean, it wasn't horrible, but if you're charging $2 for coffee, it had damn well better be good. It was not. Oh, and I got $.50 off for National Coffee Day so I only paid $1.50 and it still wasn't worth it. Blech.\n\nBut the bakery is a solid five stars. Great selection of breads, scones, muffins, croissants, etc. I honestly wish they would branch out into lowfat/sugar free/gluten free options, but I wish that of every bakery that doesn't offer those sorts of things.

"Now lemme tell you a little story.\n\nLast time I was in Greater Phoenix, it was the week of St. Patrick's Day.  My cousin was living in Scottsdale at the time and after a week of nothing but family dinners, I was dying for a night out.  I ended up many places, with shiny people drinking Bud Light in Affliction t-shirts, etc.  This time, I decided to do some research.\n\nEnter Bikini Lounge.  After convincing my relations that this was not, in fact, a strip club, we made our way there.  *This* is what I was looking for.\nMy favorite bars typically consist of A. a bar, B. two to six non-barstool seating options, C. colorful characters behind the bar, D. pool table/darts (optional).  That's all I need to get liquored right there, and I'm happy to report that I succeeded.  The tiki theme and the fact that the barmaid was a super-friendly Mexican woman in an Ozzy t-shirt were just the icing on top."
"Good hotel.  The beds are great.  Rooms are spacious.  They offer a free shuttle to take you anywhere within the downtown area.  There are no restaurants nearby, so shuttle is key.  Hotel features free Internet that is crappy.  It keeps dropping.  Room service is so-so with limited menu.\n\nWorkout room is decently sized.\n\nStaff is very courteous and helpful. \n\nThis is just me, the frequent hotel guest being picky, but the concierge lounge could have a greater selection of foods in the mornings."
"This place is fantastic.  Great atmosphere, and a really cool ilttle bar.  The food was superb.  \nWe didn't have a reservation, but they were able to seat us right away.  Probably because the room they placed us in was filled by an uber-obnoxious group, about 3 sheets to the wind (drunk).  Even they couldn't. Ruin this wonderful meal.\nThey start u with veggies and a generous bread plate.  Like almost all the places we went in Madison, they had excellent cocktails.  We ordered the frog legs (best I ever had) and the corn soup (yummy)to start.\nI ordered the sirloin, and it was great, one of the better steaks I've had.  My buddy got the rack of lamb.  It was excellent.  Luckily the portion was big enought o share.  \nA great place.  I wish I could give it 6 stars."
"Best bakery in Pittsburgh! Meh, I don't want your fruity breads Mediterra. I just want the perfect traditional rye bread. The service is great. And they have a bread card. But go early for the best selection."

"""Drove past this place for years always wondering how it stayed in business.  I thought \""""how good could a donut be from there?\""""  Look at the place?  Well, after all the reviews I finally tried it and I have to say that they make some VERY tasty donuts.  My favorites are the custard filled donuts and on Fridays the Chocolate French Crullers.

The owner came back in 10 minutes and said I have at least another 20,000 miles to go on these brakes!!! Wow!! He even topped off my fluids for NO CHARGE!

"I have stayed at the Sheraton Station Square Hotel about 10 times now, over the last decade.  I am usually there on busy weekends, so the check-in time can sometimes take a few minutes, but there are always a bellhop outside to take your bags up to your room.  For as many years as I have been staying at the Sheraton Station Square the rooms have not aged.  I think the hotel recently went under some renovations, but the rooms have always been clean with super comfortable beds and pillows.  My only complaint would probably be the same as every hotel, we tend to run out of towels and toilet paper before the maid's daily visit.  We usually have to find her in the hallway or call the front desk to get a refill."
"Local and Tourist Oasis\n\nTea house specializing in Asian boba and teas, cash only, parking lot, cafe seating"
"I was surprised to find out that this was a super casual place to eat. One of those places where you order at the front, grab a number, find a spare table, and wait as the servers find you and bring your food. Bottomless coffee is self serve. \n\nThe blueberry pancakes are really fluffy and eggy. The batter itself isn't sweet and the stack of three is topped with powdered sugar and rolled oats. Yum. The oats really do it for me. Is this is Midwest thing or have all the gazillion breakfast places I've been to on the West Coast just happen to not to that? \n\nWe also got an egg white omelet with artichokes, topped with a smidge of asiago. The marigold potatoes on the side were good but like most other patrons, we barely finished. I also appreciated how lightly they added vinaigrette dressing to the side salad. \n\nI wish this place was cleaner. And the bussers faster. We had to flag down a busy busser/server to wipe our table. Atmosphere was your standard organic-feeling breakfast place but nothing stood out. I liked Cafe Soleil's setup better."
"Dancehall night is super-fun. Delicious carrot soup, all right fried plantains. \n\nOne night, however, I swear they kept making my vodka tonics with seltzer water and were uninterested in rectifying this problem."
Grade: B\n\nJohnny D's is back from its former F+ grade. Excellent service offset by very high prices. Food Fight Inc. actually gets one right. Although 1 for 9 is a terrible batting average...
"""Transmission blew on the way into Vegas at Stateline.  Towed car to shop and conducted all business over the phone.  James was nice and knowledgable.  I needed a new tranny but he gave me options (we can refill tranny and you could \""""limp\"""" back to CA)... I opted for a new one.  Offered 2 tranny options. 1 now and have car back in timely manner or order another from CA for 4 days longer.  Price difference was around grand.  Again, more options.  Couldn't wait that long, so bit the bullet.  James worked with me on price and I varified price from my regular shop in CA.  All in all, I had as pleasent an experience as I could have.  No up sale or extra crap, just the repair."""
"Firstly, I should say -- this place does have delivery. In fact, more and more restaurants are offering a 3rd party delivery service called StraightToYourDoor.com . They are one such place at the moment. I have gone here a few times, dinner and lunch. The dinner experience I found slightly slow, even though nobody is there. Maybe its based on the way they prepare food or something but it feels like you wait forever. Even with an appetizer, I still waited a while after finishing it for my main course. Lunch is where it is at. For $7.95, they have a lunch buffet that includes naan. If you wanted to be el-cheapo, if you forgo a drink, that is under $10. I believe with a drink, it goes slightly over. But still, that is cheap for a lunch. It's a great way to introduce others to Indian food or give yourself an opportunity to explore other things you might not otherwise order for dinner. I find the wait staff very friendly and you can tell they take pride in their restaurant."
I have been seeing Dr Boyd for years. Recently had a medical issue and Dr Boyd and Sherry were so helpful. They walked me through all the steps and were able to alleviate my concerns. She sat for quite a while with my husband and I to explain to us what to expect.
"I took my classic vehicle here on the advice of a few friends in the local car community. I wish I would have found this place sooner! I had a rather time consuming and difficult job and the guys were very up front and reasonable on their prices and time line, despite how busy they always are. I was received a better quote than what most (less reputable) shops would charge and I'm 100% confident that the job was done right. Good auto work is hard to find. I'll be back and send my friends as well."
"I spent many many nights here drinking hot chocolate and studying when I was in college! It can be a little crowded, and - at least 6 years ago - power outlets could be a little sparse. \n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and quiet, they have a great variety of drinks and deserts and really excellent staff on hand. In the summer, there is outdoor seating which is nice as well."
"Got the mac and cheese pizza!  Man, was it tasty.. and you would think it's too many carbs, with the mac plus the pizza, but the pizza is super thin and flaky.  I actually wish I could have tried the caprese pizza (basil, moz, and tomato), but i was too full!"
"In a fit of experimentation, we tried this place.  How weird is it to find a bakery open late at night on a Sunday, with plenty of fresh pastries on hand?  Anyway, the big winner was the giant piece of fresh tasty flan for $2.25 (feeds 2 or more)."
"Right next door to downtown Urbana is Bunny's: the most unrated bar in Urbana. They've got the cheap drinks and food, the outdoor patio and lack of scenesters. Thank God!\n\nWith the smoking ban in place, this small time bar is probably struggling for business. Stop in and have a few drinks... drop a few quarters in the jukebox and tip your bartenders."
"Madison no doubt has some of the best egg sandwiches out there. I'd only ever had McDonald's egg mcmuffin (a zillion years ago, mind you), so perhaps my expectations weren't all that high. But my oh my, Marigold Kitchen's egg sandwich is one of the best I've had since moving to Madison a year ago. Would of gotten five stars had the bacon been cooked a little longer.\n\nFor a side I purchased potatoes, which I generally would douse in ketchup - but there was enough flavor where, dare I say it, my favorite condiment was not necessary. \n\nTried the Peppermint Mocha with Soy. Not a fan. Boyfriend enjoyed the coffee, but wished there was more of a selection rather than just one Regular or Decaf carafe. The unlimited refills made up for his griping, though."
"Super honest, friendly, and laid back. Brought my truck in for an alignment, but needed some very obvious additional work which they brought me into their garage to show me firsthand. Bob, is wicked knowledgeable and knows his stuff. I won't be taking my vehicles anywhere else from now on."
"After reading so many wedding day limo horror stories, I was a bit scared to book a limo. I am so glad everything went smoothly and our service was great! My husband handled everything and they were great at answering all his questions and changing our reservation time.  I couldn't ask for anything better!\n\nIt's been so long, I forgot our drivers name but I wish I remembered because he was great!! My husband and I got married at Excalibur and then took photos around the strip and Freemont Street. Our driver was great at getting us to all our locations in the least amount of time and super friendly. I can't even remember how many bottles of complementary champagne he gave me and my husband! That is probalby why I can't remember his name.... !\n\nDefinately choose Presidential limo for all your limo needs!"
"I have been here about 5 times and it is good authentic Thai food.  The seafood cakes(nothing like Thai fish cakes) were yummy I had never had them before but sadly they have taken them off the menu as no one was ordering them!  We've had the whole fish which was crispy delicious. we've tried all the curries really good my only complaint is they are afraid to make the food as spicy as we like it but they will give you some hot condiments.  The Pad Thai is not sweet like most places more like how they make it in New Zealand which I prefer.\n\nThe staff are always friendly, the decor looks fresh if not high end but this is not the finest neighborhood.  Definitely worth the trip."
"Pretty solid venue.  Not too big of a venue, and it can get packed at times when they sell out.  Be warned that it can get quite hot inside when there are lot of people, but what can you expect, that happens at any other venues I've been at.  \n\nThe sound does leave a little to be desired and I can see it being an issue with live acts that have vocals, but I've only been here for the dance acts and it's been a non-issue.  \n\nOne thing that I appreciate is that they have coolers of water and cups for free.  A nice change of pace from venues in Chicago that charge five dollars for a bottle of water."
"""Its one of the few \""""Japanese owned\"""" sushi joints. MOST are Korean owned. I ask every place I eat at in Japanese. There sushi is always good and they say they may cost more due to their strict Japanese standards. I felt they were reasonable."""
I love this place!  I'm so sad I'm no longer working on that side of town because it was perfect to go to location wise and they were fairly quick at their services for my lunch hour. I rarely ever had chips in my gel manis and there were times my gel polish would last 3-4 weeks. They do a superb job and each of their nail techs are friendly. I would highly recommend them!
"I was going to just give four stars because of the skimpy cheese in the Greek salad and the small size of the delicious polenta, but then I got a sip of the sleigh wrecker! Deliciously bitter and strong. Let it warm awhile as it's served too cold--the flavor definitely comes out even more as it warms up. Come early on Saturdays--it gets packed."
"I'm not sure why this place is listed in the North Side and has the wrong zip code, but all of the other info is correct, which is good! \n\nMy co-workers and I ordered from their lunch menu yesterday where all meals were under $6! When I went to pick up the food I received a box filled with food for $20. I was in disbelief! \n\nWhen I got it back to the office I saw that they threw in 2 free egg rolls, a nice touch for an egg roll fan like me! \n\nWe were all impressed with the quality and quantity of our meals! \n\nWe're already talking about ordering from there again this week!"
"I'm not really a big fan of Jack in the Box's food, but the service here makes up for the food quality.  The staff is very friendly and the location is very clean and the food is prepared well.  They serve breakfast all day, so it's a really good option if you have a hunkering for some breakfast food on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  My only wish is that they had more breakfast carb offerings like cinnamon buns, waffles, french toast sticks or something."

"Wow!  This is a gorgeous, downtown hotel with old world class and updated features.  Sometimes pricey old hotels impress with their beautiful lobbies and lounges, but disappoint with tiny guest rooms and outdated decor.  The Omni William Penn strikes a perfect balance between comfort and luxury.\n\nI might be more easily impressed than some, because I typically cannot afford hotels on this level.  But this room was part of a conference package, and I wasn't paying!\n\n$14 per night for parking in a central location seems like a steal to me, and it's $27 for valet with in/out privileges.  Not bad by most big city standards.  As others have said, very convenient location in the center of downtown, but the hotel itself has a Starbucks, a pub, and a full service restaurant.  And finally, this might seem strange, but I could not get over the fragrance of the lobby.  If they were selling bottles, I would have snapped one up!"
"Take the whole family to the movies for under $15?! Yes, Please!\nEven with the pricey popcorn this is still a deal.  If the movies are a month or two old do I really care? Nope."
"""So cute! Love how the local WF reflect the local flavor of the town and region.\n\nLayout: one side \""""health and health beauty products and foods\"""", other side regular whole foods.\n\nCheese section is making me drooooool (native Wisconsinite wishing to dear God the rest of the country had cheese like this).\n\nNo hummus? Huh? I could find a store-made BEAN DIP, but isn't hummus a bean dip, essentially? Maybe peeps here don't like it. Probably because its cool and refreshing, and with so many \""""cool and refreshing\"""" days in Madison (read: butt cold), maybe hummus doesn't, er, cut the cheese.\n\nI also get the pico de gallo at every WF I go to. Can we talk, endearingly, about Midwestern BLAND. Got enough ONIONS and TOMATOES in that MILD salsa? There wasn't a jalapeno in sight. Isn't it cute? Yes, but it's also realistic. Wisconsinites don't need to induce sweating through food. Sweating is considered dirty up here. Let's keep it to 70 degrees, you guys.\n\nAlso, the beer section may kick every other WF ass. (Beer and cheese, they do it right here)."""
"Just went to Duke's over my lunch break from work to have my back drivers side tire patched. I work on the South side and try to take care of as many of this type of problem as possible over my lunch break. That being the case, I couldn't be more happy with their service. No appointment necessary and my tire was patched in less than 10 minutes, plus it only cost $15. I'm going to go here for all of my tire services in the future! For what it's worth, I have a 2012 Mazda 3.\n\nGreat service and took no time at all!!"
"Pretty good for the price. Open late hours, so that's a plus. Wait service is decent, its a small restaurant, but its never jam-packed with people. The rice always tastes a little undercooked-- so I stay away from it, other than that, the prices are decent & the food is good."
"I can't think of an easier bar to go to. It always has a bizarre-if-nothing-else kind of crowd and the extensive scotch list is great for an adventure. It's also a great place to bike to if you live in the hood. The bartenders remember names in a cheers-esque manner and are quick with your next drink. Also, they leave you the hell alone if you're knee deep in conversation. \n\nMinus a star because of both bathrooms smelling of a variety of bodily functions generally displeasing to the olfactory functions."
"""I'm writing this as my coat is airing out--it won't be wearable for a couple of days.\n\nMaduro still stands up to the test of time--cool, soothing jazz (from a DJ) accompany the hazy, smoky venue. It feels so...classy. If I drank scotch, I'd certainly be sipping some while puffing on a cigar. But...I'm a beer snob, and a scotch noob (sp?). SO...\n\nOutstanding beer selection, as always. Expedition Stout on tap is something you won't see very often. Wish it was on cask, but they had a great brown ale in that department. My excitement, though? An awesome Destihl Altbier and, more importantly, Duchesse de Bourgnogne on tap! It's one of those nice sours that's not too sweet, which is a problem mainly.\n\nSo, why 4 stars? Well, Malthouse got Jacobins on tap this week, and if I'm giving them 5 stars for having one of the best sours, then Maduro gets 4 for one that's \""""only\"""" very good.\n\nI'll be back...when I can go outside."""
"I haven't been here in a good year because I moved to California, but Jimmy Johns is as good as it gets. I worked nearby and we ordered delivery pretty regularly and it was always really fast and DELICIOUS. Never had anything less than great service (at least at this location). I miss Jimmy Johns so much...please open a location in San Diego!"
"With practically everyone downloading music, it's hard to find a nice music store like this one.  \n\nThere's something about owning the hard copy of a CD.  Holding the CD in your hands that is so much more substantial than an album on your ipod.  Their collection is expansive, I would say to have a few CDs in mind and then venture through their goldmine.  Granted it won't be as cheap as goodwill but they probably have exactly what you want. \n\nDefinitely going here for some reasonably priced CDs."
"Important - this store in INSIDE THE HARRIS TEETER. \n\nConvenient if you are already a shopper, but parking is not always easy to find if you are just trying to get a quick coffee and be on your way.\n\nThey do have a lot of seating though, so if you plan to stay a while and work or read or something, they have a great patio area and a lot of inside seating as well.\n\nThe barista's in here are very nice. I only come here when I am already grabbing something from the market though."
"""I have been coming to this Starbucks quite a bit and for a long period of time. It is a nice quiet and smaller Starbucks on the west side. They always have everything brewed on time and they get your order quickly. It's generally cleanly and have some nice coffee-related products always stocked generously. The only thing I dislike about this particular store is the seating. For some reason people go there and take the bigger tables for just one person or take up one of the \""""comfy chairs\"""" without purchasing anything just to sit... I know its a free country but come on... anyways, It is still a place I come back to regularly and probably will always."""
"I was in a wedding in May in MD and in my typical procrastination style, I waited a week before I was due to leave to get my bridesmaid dress altered.  I saw some good reviews of Christie's on Google or somewhere so I grabbed my dress and headed there shortly after it opened.\n \nIt was pretty crowded in there and a lot of older women in there Myers Park finest could not stop singing Christie's praises, I figured if its good enough for their designer duds its good enough for me!  And it was.  Christie had me put the dress on, made sure she marked where I wanted the hem cut to, made sure the dress would be brought in at all the right spots and told me we wanted it tight up top so the uh girls don't fall out!\n\nAfter we did that, I paid, $50ish I think which is waaay better than I have paid for other bridesmaid dress alterations, and even better she'd have it done by Tuesday morning (this was Thurs).  I was very pleased and I will definitely return!"
"We've been coming here for years when at the Biltmore. I was a little disappointed this time. One of my favorite restaurants is gone. In past years several other of my faves vanished. It just didn't seem to have the same feel as before the take over. Oh, well. Gotta go with the times!"
"I love the food at this restaurant so much I would've given it five stars if I could rate the food apart from other aspects of the restaurant. I knocked it down one because one gripe is that the line to even order can extend out the door. And once you've ordered, it may take a short wait to get a table if it is significantly busy, which is usually the case. I guess that is an artifact of having food that people want. I also prefer a restaurant that is a bit more spacious, quiet and has more private feeling seating. (E.g, booth seating). For many people I understand that these things will not be an issue. It also doesn't necessarily deter me from coming to this restaurant but once I'm done eating I usually leave immediately. You can't go wrong with the French toast. Nor can you go wrong with the egg sandwich spiked with Boursin."
"""Mmmm...smoke.\n\nOkay, I don't really get very \""""mmmm\"""" about smoke, but I must say--Maduro is a fine, fine bar. I'm there for the beer (obviously).\n\nThe only problem is obvious--it's a cigar bar. Naturally, this leaves you with two options: 1) drink outside, or 2) wear disposable clothing. In the summer and spring, I opt for #1, when it's cold, I go for #2.\n\nFantastic selection of beer, and definitely one of the best in Madison. Unlike the Old Fashioned, which focuses heavily on Wisconsin beers, Maduro looks around the world. I know there's always going to be a fantastically hoppy beer on tap (or a bunch, if they're doing a tasting of the many varieties of Mad Hatter), a few Belgian sours (my absolute favorite), something from He'Brew (yay, Jews!), and an awesome beer on cask.\n\nIn terms of quality, these guys rival Malthouse. They may not have as many beers, but whoever is choosing the taps? Daaaaaaaaaaaamn, guy (or girl) knows what they're doing."""
"From the the outside, it looks kinda dumpy.  The inside isn't bad though!  Their food and prices are good.  Crab Rangoons are my favorite!  They're better than anywhere else.  Pad Thai is good also.  I don't think I've had anything from here I didn't like."
"I have never waited long here, so I am confused on some of the other posts.  This is the ONLY place I go for manis and pedis.  They give the longest and best leg and foot massages!!  Let's be serious, why else would you get a pedi?!  The staff is also great."
"this is a bit of a late review but I was trying to figure out our bartender's name.. I couldn't but whatever :) \n\nwell first off, this was my first time here and boy was our happy hour HAPPY! we came in search of some beer, apps, gaming (me) and football (her) and all of that we got!\n\nthe happy hour here is amazing, that and the gaming comps. my good friend an I are happy hour hoppers so we were stoked on this place. we will definitely be back!\n\nthanks bartender lady! \n(she was super sweet and caramel-skinned)"
"I had an emergency at a home based business and found Deke's on Yelp and chose them based of their great reviews. They went above and beyond expectations. They fit me in same day since it was an emergency, fixed the problem and just left me a bill without interrupting my already busy day. After working with them I wouldn't use another A/C Service. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
"they should update the reviews of this place, because since changing management and rehabbing this place the food and quality is very good.  It was completely crowded, has become very popular at the moment.  The szechuan menu is delishious and ridiculously spicy.  There's also a typical chinese food menu but screw that.\n\nI've become a regular at this place, once i went 4 times in one week... shit"
"I used this cleaner to press my wedding dress which was no simple task.  They did a nice job, largely because they do that work on-site rather than shipping it off to a large chain and re-wrinkling the stupid thing in the process.  Its a quality homegrown business and I love supporting it."
"""I don't do seafood, so most of the menu is off limits for me; however, I love the burrito verde and the Baja veggie wrap. Both are great, unusual vegetarian options. \n\nThe environment is laid back and funky, and the service is pretty good even on nights when it gets busy...and it DOES get busy, especially on the weekends. I recommend lunches if you don't want to wait, although it is one of the best areas of town to find yourself stuck waiting for a table. \n\nIt's great for a date, and not great for kids (unless you have very adventurous, patient kids...). My niece was hungry and cranky and didn't enjoy her food. The grownups were happy, but really...is anyone happy if the kids aren't happy?\n\nIn the end, this place gets extra credit just for incorporating \""""Fish Taco\"""" into their name. I can't say it without giggling like Butthead."""
"My wife and I decided to take a detour through Charlotte on our way home to Augusta from Wilson, NC. We wanted to eat somewhere in Charlotte and decided to pick Cabo Fish Taco because they were featured on Diners, Driveins, and dives. Overall the atmosphere was nice and friendly. For some reason the same dumb song played multiple times during our time there. Not sure what that was about. We were seated in a section that looks like they might open it up to the outside in warmer months. Someone was smoking just on the other side and it was coming in the restaurant. \n\nWe ordered cabo rolls and tuna tacos. The tacos and avocado pasta were amazing but the cabo rolls were too salty to eat. When we let our server know she immediately got us a menu to order something in place of the cabo rolls. We ordered the carne asada tacos and they were delicious! The chips weren't warm. I've never been to a good Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve warm chips. They did tasted good and the salsa was yummy and we will definitely return if we ever get to Charlotte again!"
"""We call this place \""""Secret Pizza\"""" because of how amazing it is and how hard it is to find when you're shitcanned. But it's our Secret Pizza, and we love it no matter what. Hoes down, G's up."""
"Well i just came back from san fran and this place is like my place for bread in town.  Not san fran sourdough, but Ill take it!"
"Portofinos on Park Road is one of the few places I go for good Italian cuisine in the QC.  I'm not saying it's the best Italian I've ever had, but it certainly ranks up there as far as Charlotte goes.  After living in New York for two years, I arrived in Charlotte less than satisfied with the pizza choices.  Portofinos comes CLOSE to having a perfect New York slice of pizza.  I say CLOSE because the cheese and sauce are deliciously tangy, with the perfect amount of spice and sharpness.  The crust is also delicious, and you can tell hand made.  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the crust is a bit thick. I think they could make it a bit thinner and truly have a winner.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and inviting, their pasta dishes are excellent and their house dressing is TO DIE for. It's a cross between a Thousand Island and a French dressing.\n\nIf you're craving Italian, this place won't let you down."
"This is a Charlotte favorite. I have always been in conflict with the drunken, sticky floors on Saturday night and church on Sunday.\n\nIf anyone has been there recently they have noticed the changes. They are good. The bar is nicer and there are 2 stages now\n\nPlease keep doing the Noda arts/crafts fairs."
"We visited because of the DDD segment and the recommendation of our driver. It was definitely good and worth visiting, but I wouldn't quite give it a 100%. The original margarita was good but not great. The rice & beans lacked a distinctive flavor. Highlights: the service was very prompt and friendly, and the lemon shrimp taco and avocado pasta salad were exceptional. Well worth the visit."
"The sonic here makes an awesome milkshake. Fast food milkshakes are hit or miss but they've been hits here. The problem is, it's 10:22 PM and I've been sitting here in the drive thru for the past 20 minutes. The good news, coconut cream pie shake is delicious. Be patience or leave, your call."
"BEST donut shop in Vegas.\n\nCash only. VEGAN (almost all donuts). Independent, family owned.

Definitely don't want to hear any whining vegans tell me they can't enjoy the same things I do, because now I have something to throw back and it's RONALD'S DONUTS!"
"Nice theater. Good sized kids pack. Clean seats, totally didn't have that stinky sticky smell at all."
"The truth is, the South Side has changed drastically in 15 years.  Institutions like Dee's Cafe, Tom's Diner, The Beehive, and Bar 11 are now just stopping places on a night of debauchery.  The Frat & Sorority Mentality ( someone else will clean up my puke, pee, mess, etc.) that pervades the So'Side is disturbing. \n\nTom's Diner is being reviewed by late-night visitors and tourists that only stumble in when half-drunk.  I wonder if they ever strolled down Carson Street on a Tuesday mid-day and noticed the calm neighborhood that is in SHARP contrast to the late-night shenanigan's?\n\nI like Tom's Diner.  Simple diner food, always filling up my coffee, and convenient location.  The newest addition that I didn't care for:  a bar next door that does not have a door between the loudness of it's interior and the diner next door.  Owners of Tom's Diner - Please Add a Door!"
"This is a Staple!! My go to place when ever I get the Thai itch. Which is pretty often.\n\nMy order (with others to share of course) goes something like this...\nCucumber salad\nBeef Satay\nTom Yum Koong or Tom Ka Koong with a side of rice\nChicken Pad Thai\n\nI have also had and would never turn down Green or Red Curry, and Crab Rangoon. \n\nThe quality is ALWAYS consistent as is the Service. I like spicy and usually opt for a 5. Sometimes 6 burns a little on the way out... :)~"
"This place has wicked good BBQ at super low prices.  The sauce here is tart and vinegary.  When they say spicy, it actually is a bit.\n\nThey cook the meat over wood, for pete's sake.  Imparts a great flavor.\n\nThe only reason they are not 5 stars is the sides.  Just aren't great.  The bread is insipid; fries ok, but how hard is it to get fries wrong?\n\nCounter service is ok; not problematic, not dynamic customer service, either.\n\nIt's not really a hang out an' chill place, very chow down and git atmosphere.  Take out is the best option.  Daily specials of lots o' meat for super cheap are the best reason to eat here."
"I must say with the amount of business this Burger King does it has always been accurate, fast and declicious.\n\nThey have the best chicken sandwich (The Original) in town.\n\nI would have given 5 stars but, the trash can in the drive thru when you are exiting is always full and overflowing.  Who wants to drive over trash?  Not me....."
"Best shoe repair in Charlotte! I have taken shoes elsewhere before (a couple places Uptown close to work, etc. and the quality just does not compare). \n\nI brought in my favorite pair of Tory Burch wedges that I had worn the heal completely down on and they look brand new again. \n\nI also brought in an Ugg that had a huge tear right by the toe, and they stitched a thin line over the tear and it looks great considering how it looked before! \n\nDid not take long and prices are great. I dropped them off Tuesday night and they were ready by Friday afternoon."
"As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the sweetest Filipino Aunty EVER! I've been to plenty of Filipino food places with shady people trying to nickel and dime you for everything.  But Aunty straight hooked me up with extra rice, and sabow (soup), to go with my two choice meal.  She made me feel at home, like I was her long lost nephew, and it was her extra TLC that made the efood that much better.  If she doesn't have something ready, she will cook it on the spot!  But if you're smart, you'll call ahead to make sure the food will be ready for you once you get there!  If I'm craving some Filipino food in Vegas, I'd definitely swing by here for some good home style food and special family treatment."
"I give Heddy's only a 4-star review because I haven't been in a few years. They used to be in teeny-tiny shop on Charleston, but they did have GREAT fabrics! I was needing super-stretch power Spandex, and they totally came thru like a champ for me. Better price than Williams Costume, but the fact the are closed on Sundays is a letdown.\n\nThry have some very very nice, expensive fabrics and notions, but i've yet to see it anywhere else in Vegas like it. If you are really into sewing, Heddy's is worth a visit!"
"Their pizza is awesome. I lived around the corner from them for a couple years. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5 is bc sometimes some of the guys that work there can be terse and rude. Some of them are really nice, some are not."
"Mmm mmm!  I love to hit Razzoo's when I'm in Concord and fill up on the endless catfish & shrimp.  The hushpuppies are very good, too!  I'd heard good things about the deep-fried pickles but while I found the flavor to be ok, I thought they were too dried out to thoroughly enjoy.\n\nI will say that I think my daughter had a hard time finding something she could enjoy (the kids menu was pretty lame).  They should incorporate some smaller portioned entrees for the kids and tone the seasoning down some because she can get canned spaghetti or frozen chicken strips anywhere."
"""So one day I walk into dis tea store with ma posse and so I asks the chinese kid dere wat was good cuz on account I can't reed good but den i remember i was reeding da chinese menu.

Came here on a date (which sucked BTW)  but onto the food. Great atmosphere and friendly fast workers. The food is yummo however if you're into spicy spicy this isn't the place. Overall I'm giving it a 5. I recommend it
"I had no idea this location existed and had it not been for a couple of co-workers who had a craving, probably never would have. Very near Sahara and LV Blvd., I wasn't really sure what to expect. Much to my surprise, it was very clean and unexpectedly big on the inside. I've been to a few Capriotti's locations where you can barely turn around, but this place has a huge dining area and open kitchen where you can see the magic take place. Our sandwiches were out in a flash and it was service with a smile all around. My Slaw-be-joe was as good as ever and I devoured every inch. The only drawback for me was no fountain drinks. Bottles only, but they do offer a wide variety of options. I will definitely return."
"""5 stars because Paper Skyscraper always gets me out of that awkward \""""what on earth do I buy so-and-so\"""" moment. Thank God for Paper Skyscraper. Most of their items are completely unnecessary- but you will find the perfect gift for a co-worker, a bride or anyone else on the long gift giving list."""
Can I say anything bad about phat burrito? No I can't. Nothing beats a bbq chicken burrito. The food is fresh and flavorful. The salsa bar has a great variety and the service is chill and laid back. Just found out they are serving breakfast now too. \nOnly advice I have is try to avoid this place during peak hours. Other than that you're always in for a treat.
"The food, service and atmosphere are great here. As a visitor to Charlotte I am only sad that I cant eat here every weekend!\n\nBut when I do visit, its on my list of must do's!"
"Back in the day when I lived in Madison, I just about lived in the 'Dise, which was where everyone I knew and their brothers used to hang out. I had to go back and show my husband my old stomping ground, for old time's sake. Yep, it's the same. Thanks for not changing, Paradise. And thank you even more to the patrons who didn't steal my wallet after I accidentally left it there (whoops!)"
"vegan vegan vegan!\n\nI don't know how you can make something taste so good and not be at least a little bad for you. Well, definitely get the apple burrito. It has a nice apple to donut ratio which makes it border-line dessert! haha. There other donuts are good too, like donuts.\n\nNice service too. Very friendly."
"""My husband and I stayed here for the first 3 nights of our Vegas vacation. At first, it seems musty and a bit off-putting but this is a GOOD hotel. I swear it.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n- Extremely clean.\n- Well lit.\n- Comfortable / warm bed.\n- Walking distance to The Strip.\n- Extremely quiet.\n- Pool & exercise room looked great.\n- Fantastic little restaurant Coco's next door.\n- View from the room was really nice.\n- Curtains were complete black-out.\n\nTHE BAD:\n- Casino was overly smokey/musty.\n- WiFi was not good. Never stayed connected.\n- Only one usable wall outlet (strange).\n- None of the food on site was affordable.\n\nThe good HEAVILY outweighs the bad here.\nThe negative reviews I've read about this hotel do seem valid in ways, but after staying at the moldy, deplorable sh*thole that is \""""Alexis Park All Suite Resort\"""" I would do anything to be back at Hooters (paying far less)."""
"I have been to many shows at the Orpheum. Let me start by saying that this is a beautiful theatre. It is very old school and has beautiful paintings on the ceiling. The seats are comfortable enough and the layout is such that most seats have a decent view, although the seats towards the front are slightly obstructed by the stage  (the floor isn't slanted as much as some theatres). Anyway, my main complaint with the Orpheum is they don't get enough good shows... there are rarely shows here that I feel that I would like to see. This may not be the venue's fault, but it certainly affects the frequency that I visit this theatre. The last show I saw there was Bring It On the musical (A family member asked me to go with them) and it was not good....at all.... Anyway, If there is a show you are interested in seeing at this venue, I would highly recommend it!"
"I had a great experience here. \n\nWhen you decide to drop a chunk of change on a gift, you don't want to feel unsure you got something nice or paid the wrong price.  I went in and told them roughly what I was looking for and my budget, and they stuck to it.  They have a great selection of classic and modern pieces, Victorinox, Hamilton, Citizen, Skagen....\n\nIf you need a watch in Madison, this is the place to go."
I have been to this place many many times and I have never had bad food. My only suggestion for them would be that the servers could be friendlier. Wah Kee is far from my house so I do not get to visit often but when I do it is always a treat!
"Amazing! Don't waste your time with the sandwiches or pizza--all that stuff just gets in the way of the main event: the pretzel! Best pretzel in the city.  Best anything in the anywhere. Cheap, too. Only complaint: not open late enough."
"There's no way I would've found this place without yelp.  Listen to the other reviewers.  This is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by businesses you don't typically go to, but the sandwiches are really really good.  A tad bit expensive, but worth it in my opinion.  My favorite is the 4b (I get the large, so it's $10 instead of $9.25 for a regular with a drink).  It's a meatball sub with marinara and bacon.  I also got a breakfast burrito here once (their salsa was great in it), and I couldn't eat the rest of the day.  \n\nOne warning: there is a $1 surcharge for credit/debit cards."
"""While I agree with people who call it \""""Whole Paycheck,\"""" and that many of the items are overpriced, WFMM has a wide selection of unusual, organic, non-GMO certified, and special-diet options (vegan in the house, what up). Plus, the Madison store has the SWEETEST classes. Seriously, have you seen them? Cooking classes, beer tastings, henna tattoo workshops... check it (http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/events?store=6611)\n\nLast but not least, bicycle benefits members receive $5 off $30 in groceries. Now THAT'S something I can get behind."""
"My family and I were in Pittsburgh for just over a week after Christmas this year because of an ill family member who had been transferred to UPMC.  The staff at this hotel went above and beyond.  The shuttle drivers accommodated our need to get back and forth from the hospital even at non-designated times. One shuttle driver in particular picked us up from the hospital and drove us to whole foods and back to the hospital because it was New Years day and no other food options were available to accommodate my dietary restrictions- even though his shift was done at 6 and I wasn't able to call for the ride until right before 6. The front desk staff was understanding of our need to be flexible with checkout times since we weren't sure what day the discharge and transfer would be happening.\n\nThe room was nice, the cleaning staff were thorough, the rest of the staff were compassionate and lovely, and the breakfast food selection wasn't bad either.\n\nAll in all this was a haven when my family needed it most and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone staying in the Oakland area!"
"I've lived the area for nearly 8 years now and decided to wander in for breakfast. It was pretty much what I expected. NOTHING FANCY! However, it was really inexpensive good tasting food being served. I had the bacon and eggs (over medium) with a short stack of pancakes. The bacon was crispy as I requested. The eggs were over easy which I could deal with...the over medium is a new thing I'm trying these days. The pancakes were light and fluffy. The dining room doesn't offer any frills whatsoever. The benches in the booths are cushion less and orange which is the most annoying color that makes you want to leave as quickly as possible according to color studies. I have no complaints though. In fact, I can say I'll probably eat here again. What I didn't get was why they could use real plates but not use silver forks and knives instead of plastic. Maybe I'll try a breakfast burrito when I come back."
"Well this is a business Costco first so, I realize it is the closest Costco to the strip and your normal Costco card will work here. It is a lot different. Hence Business Costco, however the deals as normal Costco and they do have food but, it is more focused towards restaurants and small biz. \nThey do have gas here so that is good and important for you frugal Costco shoppers."
"I can't say enough good things about this company. I usually go through craigslist, but when my outside HVAC Unit fan stopped spinning I knew I needed a professional. I actually chose Action Air based on the number of great reviews they had here on Yelp.com. \n\nI scheduled for a 7 am appointment. The Tech was right on time, quickly diagnosed the problem, and had the part on his truck. After he replaced the motor, he noticed the breaker switch outside was broken. He went and picked up the part and installed it for no extra labor or charges. \n\nReasonable prices, and outstanding service."
"Had a fabulous time at Charlie's, meeting friends from college and making new friends there!\n\nI did find it odd for a dance lesson to be going on during peak hours.  Must be a Southwest thing.  Over here on the East...dance lessons are Mondays and Wednesdays at 5pm.\n\nSome of the bar areas could use a renovation and expanded instead of looking like it used to be a janitor closet.\n\nWith all the dancing going on, it got a bit hot in there.  Nice to have a covered outdoor patio to hang out...if you can handle the cigarette smokes all around.\n\nOverall, I had a good time with friends at Charlie's!"
"""One of the best Mexican food restaurants I ever have been to All my friends and family have gone here since early 80's, I live in Los Angeles now and miss the true real deal that El Norteno has.

"""It had a small theater, Onyx, in the back. Strange. But it's good for them, because I ended up browsing the merchandise as I was waiting for the door to \""""open\""""...\n\nI overheard the unannounced discount of leather goods and underwear. So I tried out a few leather items before and after the show. It was too crowded to ask the clerk for help at the end. So I returned the following day so I can ask the same clerk ample help. And I bought a few items even though many were from discontinued stock.\n\nI did check out the online site afterward. There was no discount offered.\n\nThe clerk was nice and helpful to some degrees. He did give me more discount than \""""unadvertised\"""". I recommend checking out this place."""
Fast & friendly .
"I'd never experienced having a mechanic take the time to call me a couple days after the repair to ensure the part he replaced fixed the problem. That exemplified the kind of care and service I've gotten from Westside Service Center over the years. They're honest, straightforward in their diagnoses, and never try to upsell me on non-essential repairs. I highly recommend these guys."
"The food was delicious and the ambiance was amazing the live entertainment was so nice especially because I was celebrating my birthday, however the service was a little slow we were there for 3 hrs and waited almost an 1 1/2 to get our food. I think if our waiter would have come to our table just once to update us on our meal or apologize for the wait it would have made a difference especially when we saw others that were seated after us get their meals first."
"If it weren't for my heavy travel schedule, Stefan and Kim would nhave to increase their bacon inventory.\n\nA great breakfast & lunch spot.\n\nAlso, one of the best cups of jo in the Valley."
"I have gone to Dr. Bonsett-Veal for over 4 years. I have found his prices to higher than other eye specialists. I feel that he is an excellent doctor and I don't mind paying for that. However, his frames and lenses are higher than most other places. My prescription for glasses purchased from him cost over $500. I wanted sunglasses. I went to a local shop, I was able to get the sunglasses and frames for $245.75. I am on a fixed income so this was a great help to my purse. I have found his staff to be personable. The office has the latest equipment for diagnosis of the eyes."
I have played many shows here and seen even more. Place needs an update with sound and the overall warehouse look.\n\nReally it is the only place to go to see great shows in Charlotte.
"Car trouble is never fun, but Tom has always made my experience pleasant. I stumbled across this shop when I first moved to Madison, and I wouldn't go anywhere else. Tom has a wonderful personality and offers very honest advice and very reasonable prices for his services. One time he looked over our car prior to a road trip and he even put air in our SPARE tire- just in case. He does the extra mile, and I couldn't speak more highly of Tom or Wright's Auto!"
"A Madison original.  Bagels are fresh, sandwiches are cheap, and service is pretty quick.  These aren't your traditional NY style bagels so don't get your hopes up but a pumpernickel sandwich with cream cheese and salami is hard to argue."
"Had a nail in my tire. By checking reviews on Yelp at my area decided to go to Discount Tire. First time and great experience - 30 min, my tire was repaired and it was free. Great experience. Will be back when i need new tires!"
Dr. Fife and his staff are the best!!! I needed a root canal last one I had was over 25 years ago. In my head I was preparing myself for days of pain and multiple visits to the dreaded dentist chair. I was in and out in 35 minutes. No pain at all. Even stopped at Coffee bean and Costco on the way home. I do feel I need to make one negative remark in this review I forgot to pick up a bottle of wine at costco!  Oh and yes Dr Fife called me on his way home to see how I was doing. Thank you so much Dr. Fife
The owners here seem honest and forthright.  They recently saved us more than $600 on a brakeline repair for a 2003 Hyundai.  The dealer (Cochran Hyundai) insisted that we absolutely had to do a $1400 repair before our trip to California last month.  We had the car towed to Frick Park Automotive for a second opinion and they did it for less than half that.  \n\nMade it to California with no problems whatsoever... thanks guys!
"""I came for Piano Man at the suggestion of a friend of mine. It was full of undergrads who don't have any homework yet, but we were able to find seats on the side of the room. It's a nice big space, and pretty much any seat is a good one. The Piano Man (sorry dude, I don't know your real name) played a good range of stuff, from the required \""""Piano Man\"""" and Elton John to Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears. (Does anyone else find it disturbing that everyone knew the words to Miley? Hit Me Baby One More Time I get, but Party in the USA? Really?)\n\nThe cheap booze was added incentive. $2 long islands are a recipe for destruction, although I could have used a little more alcohol in mine. I don't like to fight for space but hopefully it'll be a little less crowded when the semester starts up. Would visit again."""
Excellent people.  They stayed late when AAA took forever to come tow my car.  They were very reasonably priced and took good care of my car.  I can't say enough good things.
"After 7 yrs in Vegas I'll admit I've strayed from my previous CA vegan(ish) lifestyle/diet. My initial visit to Komol was very refreshing for me, helping me to realize what I was previously accustomed to and satisfied with. Hats off to Komol, I'm back on track.... sort of."
"""Good service, fair... Told me the price before they did the work and no \""""hidden\"""" costs were added. I would recommend. No hassle."""
"Some friends and I went to Blueberry Hill late one night and order a wife variety of entrees (steak dinner, pancakes, breakfast skillet, cheeseburger, and various other items). Everything was very good and so cheap! The steak was tender and cooked perfectly. The pancakes were phenomenal (I had apple cinnamon). The portions were large and the coffee was great, too. Our only complaint was the service. Once we got our food we didn't get visited by our waiter for a very long time.  We needed refills on our drinks and it took forever. We couldn't even flag down our waiter to get help. I recommend going for the food despite the service, but I warn you to be prepared for mediocre service. You may want to order two of your drink (or a carafe) just in case."
"Went here on a referral.  Dr Sal is AMAZING.  Who likes a pap?  But I think Im especially sensitive/ squirmish/ and prone to have an absolute meltdown.  Dr Sal is quick, gentle, compassionate, and is willing to spend time getting to know not only your medical history but you personally.  Matthews is far for me but worth it.  Ill follow Dr Sal wherever she goes. In addition the hospital is clean an beautiful."
"""This bar was a lot of fun! I loved the cheap/reasonably priced drinks, I loved the diverse crowd. I can't speak for the food since I ate elsewhere before the bar but overall atmosphere gets 5 stars. One thing I would like to say, this place needs to check who they allow to play live music in there. The guys who played Saturday 3/1, Kevin Marshall and Scott Sutton, were incredibly racist and made no qualms about it in their songs. I'm a white guy and I was extremely offended by their ignorance. If you read this, Big Al's, don't let these a-holes play in your bar anymore. Also, they were way too loud. Good bar for a night out with friends, just check the schedule for live music and make sure the aforementioned \""""musicians\"""" aren't there."""
"After my previous experience at Nakama the General Manager stepped up an showed outstanding customer service!  Im happy to say i will continue to eat at Nakama thanks to the upper management,  & for my love of the food, but im still upset i cant have my food exactly the way i want it."
"You will definitely not go away hungry after breakfast at Pamela's. The servings are huge and the prices are moderate (though it is cash only). Had the breakfast special which came with two eggs, choice of meat, and two of their famous crepe pancakes - couldn't finish it all! As to the pancakes, they are thin, crispy around the edges, and the size of a dinner plate. I wished I had ordered the strawberry stuffed pancakes after I saw them at the table next to me. Oh well, there's always next time! \n\nVisited August 2011"
"My biggest gripe: NO FRENCH FRIES!\n\nBut that's ok, I just try to to go on Mashed Potato Monday (with white gravy....heaven!).  The burgers are great as are some of their platters, like the meatloaf!), and the mac and cheese is ah-mayyy-zing. For dessert I look no further than the huge rice krispy treats.  Lupie's is great because it's really reasonably priced, it oozes southern charm, and it's a Charlotte landmark. What more could one need?"
"I've been known to eat at Panera for both breakfast and lunch, many times. I don't know what it is about this place but the food (for what it is) is pretty damn good!  Service is usually top notch and the food quality seems good.  I'm a little hesitant about their cafe drinks (frozen caramel, lattes, etc) as every time I have one I get an upset stomach. Only complaint is the tables/booths should be cleaned more thoroughly...nothing chaps my ass more than having to clean my table and chair/booth before sitting down."
"I was a Sunday walk in for a nose piercing.  I was greeted in what I thought to be a reasonable amount of time... I was given paperwork to fill out, and was waiting for the artist to become available.  I was provided with post care instructions that were very clear and concise.\nOnce I was with the 'piercer' he was very personable, and asked if I had any questions, marked my nose, and went for it. \nAlthough I have wanted a nose piercing for years, I hadn't done much research... blow your nose millions of times prior to going in.... be prepared for a betadine cotton swab to be shoved up and wiggled around your nose.  The piercing didn't hurt too badly, but threading of the ring wasn't too pleasant.\nYou are provided a bottle of betadine to clean your ring.\nOver all, I am happy :-)\n\nIf you're looking for a tattoo, make an appointment, esp for a Sunday."
"Luv's is the place for late night, sugar-fest cravings - where calorie count is never to be questioned. The standard custard that comes in the short list of specialty concoctions is smooth, creamy or overly sweet. \n\nTried the Western and a bit of the Scotch Jimmie. Usually not a butterscotch fan, but I liked it's slightly buttery toffee flavor. \n\nOpen late into the night, And it doesn't look like a place that closes. \n\nDRAWBACKS\nIt's located on LVB, but the sketchy local side. The other customers are varied, but many look like the wandered out of or just finished their shift at OG - a close by strip club. * and no seating. With the common clientele, a reason is not hard to imagine. \n\n** Please go - even if you get accosted , you'll have a good Vegas experience and a helluva desert."
I hate writing reviews but thought it was necessary to give credit for my awesome cut. I've been going to barber shops for years and thought I would give this spot a chance. I requested Noah based on the reviews I read and was very pleased with the results. Noah listened to what I want  and gave suggestions as went. Everyone was super friendly and the complimentary cleanup between cuts is also a great score! Mos definitely I'll be coming back!
"First time here, and the food is excellent. Our bartender, albeit sweet and very friendly, seemed rushed and took a long time to get to us even though she only had about 8 guests. Plus, we waited almost half an hour for a salad. Will try again."
"Best california rolls in the city. Always soft and top quality ingredients. Yes the lady is rude but maybe just try and look over the menu before you go so you know exactly what you want so you don't have to bother asking questions and waiting. She honestly doesn't really bother me because the food is always good and that's all that matters to me, and I don't mind getting up to go find her if she takes too long with the check. I'm there for the food, not to be treated like a queen. Their dumplings are also delicious steamed or fried. I have been coming here since I was in 6th grade to get an order of california rolls and fried dumplings and it NEVER disappoints. The sushi chef is a very nice, clean dude."
My cousin lives across the street from Los Compadres. I was starving and decided to give it a shot. I called and placed my order to go. A red chile burrito with a side of cheese and sour cream. I got there and was shocked my burrito was only $5! Usually restuarants charge an arm and a leg for side items. I asked the girl for an iced tea to go and she gave it to me for free! I thought that was really sweet of her so I gave her a nice tip. I was very pleased with my food and I would't hesitate to come back. The restaurant isn't fancy just a good solid place to get cheap tasty Mexican food.
"Allegro has the best bread in Pittsburgh.  They're yeasty and crusty and perfect. It's preservatives free, so store them carefully. I was not a fan of the cupcakes; I had the carrot, while the cake part is fine, the frosting left much to be desired."
"""Homer's has met all of my auto maintenance/inspection needs since we moved to Pittsburgh a year ago, and I've never looked back.  They are considerate and honest, and the prices are reasonable given the good work that they do.  Interestingly - the one time I had to go to another shop (Penn Automotive) - because my car was damaged and State Farm recommended them - the Penn Automotive guy offered to do my 30,000 mile maintenance while I was there, and I said I normally got that done at Homer's.  The Penn Automotive guy said \""""Well, never mind.  I don't want to take business away from those guys - they are great.\""""  How about THAT?  A rave review from their own competition?"""
"I am happy to have found a Vietnamese place that can make all those favorites I grew up with. Having just moved here a few weeks ago, and having lived in NorCal, Chicago, and DC, I was expecting the worst. Being half-Viet, I grew up eating the fried spring rolls, spicy beef noodle soup, and rice dishes. This restaurant definitely gets props for trying to tackle the variety of Vietnamese cuisine. Lots of places can do only one or two things well, but this place has gotten a bunch of things right. It's not perfect, like the rice dishes (com dia) should have the rice chopped, not whole grain, and the spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo hue) was missing the pork blood cake (but honestly I never eat it anyways).  But those are relatively minor.  The staff were really nice and attentive.  So, I will be sure to check out the rest of the Vietnamese restaurants in Madison, but I am happy with this find."
"""We recently had our Xbox 360 repaired here when we experienced the \""""open tray\"""" error. The gentleman who assisted us was great and they repaired our system in just a few days during the holiday busy season.  I like doing business with genuine people like these folks who provide a fair and honest service.  In addition, they provide cost effective previously owned games as well.  We picked up a couple of those too!  Overall, a good experience and you can't go wrong here."""
"Good guys taking care of this issue fast!  Got in, no wait and taken care of no issues getting my problem resolved .  Falls short of 5 due to cleanliness .  But thanks overall."
Took in a 1997 Specialized that had fallen into severe disrepair. Was seeking to rebuild it so a young friend could learn to mountain bike at low start up costs. The tech did an excellent job what repairs were required to insure it could safely be ridden. The repairs were done quickly and exactly on budget. The bike looks and rides great. Thanks for a job well done!
Are you kidding me-1 dozen donut holes for $1!!! Who says you can't get anything for a buck.\n\nEveryone has pretty much nailed it with the donuts & the pics tell the rest. Good stuff.
Very quaint and cozy...on line reservations were screwed up (which seems to be a theme in many reviews) but the owner called and moved us to a more expensive room at a discount.   We loved running and walking across the street and walking to the Badger game.  Owner and staff were very friendly and welcoming.  My only complaint would be the heat would not turn down....everything else was great.
"I got a little bit sick after the Gaeng Kua Curry but my friend seemed to be okay.  This place isn't exactly what I would call aesthetically beautiful but it's cozy.  Plus, I love curry like it's nobody's business so this place gets automatic props.  I can drink curry til I get sick (probably why I did get sick).\n\nMy friend and I originally meet at another restaurant across the street.  We saw the menu prices and was scared out into the streets.  We walked a block and ran into this restaurant.  The prices are decent and the food is good (I can only attest to the curry).  \n\nParking might be a little hard.  Other than that, this is definitely a healthy, affordable place.  I'll be back!"
"I do enjoy Hamburger Works - every once in a while, I just HAVE to have one of their burgers.  The basic cheeseburger and fries special #1 is all it takes to make me a happy boy, if a bit bloated.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the interiors.  If cleanliness is next to godliness, then the owners of this place must worship Satan.  Also, the place is in dire need of a redo.  A fresh coat of paint and some new furniture would really be worth the investment!"
"OK, I went to the Penguin on Monday (I heard it was open again), and I left stuffed with fried food, a hamburger, and a cheap pabst blue ribbon. Used to go to the old place, not seeing much difference, fried pickles are still good, burgers are still greasy and fat. Oh, and they had waffle fries, which I prefer to the old ones. I also liked the fact that everyone was dressed down, obviously no dress code here, and there were all kinds of people. The most important thing was the price, the two of us ate for $16, you just can't beat it. DoCan only give a Drive-In 4 stars though, even a really good one like The Penguin don't care who owns it, just want a cheap place for lunch."
"Who would have thought you could find amazing Cajun food in this small, hole in the wall?  We ordered the gator bites, they were fried and pretty hood.  But let's face it, more of a experience than a gourmet item.  I had the fish and grits and my friend had the chicken carbonara, both were phenomenal!  Huge portion, just right amount of spice, great piece of sweet cornbread to sop it up.  Skip the chains, try something new, support locals!"
"I had the pineapple rice. Overall it was good. I was hoping for more shrimp. In the whole dish their were only two shrimp. Service was good. If I knew there was going to be non existent shrimp I would've ordered something else instead of paying $12.95 for rice, pineapple & chicken."
"""This review is mostly for brunch because I think it's what they really excel at. I've had dinner here once and I think it was good... but a little unmemorable. The brunch, on the other hand is awesome.\n\nTheir eggs benedicts are really delicious, especially the artichoke, which is my favorite. My most recent visit I got the crab cakes and I didn't love it, but the sauces and creamy and very tasty. If you like sweets, I highly recommend the Bananas Foster French Toast - it's unbeatable! My boyfriend literally said, \""""I can never finish 4 pieces of French toast except here.\"""" They're that good. The cheese grits are a nice side with anything. I don't love their potatoes because they're very creamy and heavy. \n\nThey have nice seating outside if you happen to be in Madison during the 3 months when it's warm enough to consider it. Make sure to make reservations for Sunday brunch - they get very busy."""

"I decided I wanted to buy a bike for riding around town running errands, quick grocery trips, etc.  I am new to the whole bicycle culture and was a little overwhelmed by all of my options.  The staff here was incredibly helpful -- they asked the right questions and pointed me in the right direction.  No up-selling and, in fact, they told me what things I didn't need so that I saved some cash.  I bought some accessories (lights, rack, etc) and they installed them immediately at no charge.  Highly recommend."
"If Taxi Driver were set in Charlotte, I guess Travis Bickle would have asked Betsy to the Landmark for pie and coffee.\n\nOnce you're inside the Landmark, you could be in Queens or Chicago.  It's a timeless, placeless type of restaurant.  that's kind of the beauty of it.\n\nThe desserts steal the show from the moment you walk in.  All those giant cream pies and cakes, baklava, hamentashen, etc.  I got some banana cream pie and loved it.  It was so rich, however, that I had to abandon the last few bites.\n\nThe non-dessert offerings are nearly endless.  You can get breakfast any time, as well.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake, so to speak, is that they're open way late, a feature that other places in the Queen City are finally waking up to."
"There are many people in need of food.  Sometimes we take for granted how blessed we are to have what we need.  St Mary's helps those who aren't so fortunate.  Whenever there's a food drive, our family ensures that we donate several bags of food.  We make sure it's non-perishable and that the packaging is durable so that it can be easily stored, transported, and distributed.\n\nAs long as they continue to help feed the needy, we'll keep coming back to assist.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"
"""I'm a fan, but only moderately. I can't really say that I see this is \""""my HT\"""" just yet. It works and has everything, per usual. The layout is a bit odd, and I do feel a bit congested near the entrance/exit. Still enjoy the produce section of HT and find this one to be on par with others around town. \n\nBig plus for having a bike rack outside. Living less than a mile away, I'm prone to get around more on my bike. Working out at the Dowd and then utilizing the bike lanes on East to get home makes this an easy destination for small necessities or singular items for dinner(s). \n\nI can see this location becoming our regular spot in due time."""
"My regular bakery. \n\nThe loafs are typically very good, and they rarely disappoint. I can recommend the seedless rye (what's wrong with people to like sesame seeds in their bread? overpowering!), but other loafs are very good too. Their Challah loaf, brioche (particularly with raisin), and cinnamon loaf are all excellent, and make for delicious breakfasts. Prices are reasonable. Cooking varies from time to time, and the bread crust can be more or less cooked...\n\nA letdown: their croissants are not great."
"We came here after we left another restaurant for dinner due to their slow service and it was like night and day!  Sure- this is your typical Mexican joint, but the atmosphere, speedy service where they really cater to you, and the price is where this place sets itself apart. I got the Don Juan entree with chicken, and I had plenty to bring home. The chicken in this dish is worth the price as it's not the dried out shredded chicken in most other plates. The mushroom flavor was evident but reminded me too much of my favorite canned Cream of Mushroom.\n\nThe chips and salsa were flowing, the mariachi band kept the patrons moving, and the food was plentiful.  I'll come here anytime I need a fix of quick and tasty Mexican food."
This place take you back to a time when food taste real and the service was real also. Like that diner where everybody knows your name. Where the portions kill your stomach but not your wallet. Cant believe i have never heard of this place. A must go. Z
These people are knowledgeable and the store carries everything from sexual health products to sex toys.
Slow leak on my left rear tire.  They found a nail repaired it and sent me on my way. NO CHARGE. Gotta love that. I've bought many tires there over the years but this was my newest car so I greatly appreciate the A+ service.
"""One of Charlotte's best kept secrets on Eastway?  Maybe so, I never would have ever went into this place if my cousin told me how great it was. I did not know that they were affiliated with the other Charlotte locations. I love how they have some of the best \""""New York Style Pizza\"""" in Charlotte. Most places that claim they have the best have garbage in my opinion. \n\n\nThe service is really great as well, our server would come by every few minutes to check on us and we would chat with him for a good bit too. Dining in makes me feel I am in a Romano's to some extent. The subs are good, I generally would get the meatball one."""
"I love coming here, Kevin is amazing at what he does!! If I don't like something, or want it changed; there is never a problem. Prices are affordable and good for the quality of work. Thanks More Than Nails!!!"
Closest thing to the real thing on the west coast great food
"""I would give 5 stars if they didn't being so rushy....Thurs night open tables everywhere, 10 mins in food is on the table, while we are talking \""""are you done?\"""" Umm ok yea...another 10 mins \"""" sir, are you finish?\"""" Anyways, the fastest fine dining we ever had. From seated to done about an hour and 10mins. Steaks is no doubt one of the best."""
"Dish is AMAZING... sometimes.\n\nThe problem with Dish is that the quality of the food varies greatly.   The first time my wife and I ate here we fell in love with the place.  In subsequent visits the food has ranged from great to ... mediocre.\n\nI'm sticking with 4 stars here because the BBQ pulled pork sandwich is always fantastic, and it is my favorite dish.   The squash casserole can be great on a good day, or bland on a bad day.\n\nThe pot roast has been pretty awesome on a regular basis.  And the meatloaf is good.\n\nService is a great, and the ambiance is pretty cozy during quiet times, and even fairly pleasant when the place is hopping.\n\nOh, and the biscuits are some of the best in Charlotte.\n\nThis restaurant really needs to do some quality control on their kitchen.   If they were at their best all the time, I would easily give them 5 stars."
"I'm surprised at all the haters here...... I love this place.  It's not five star dining for sure, but the pizza is awesome and I have always gotten excellent service, nobody working there has ever been rude or looked dirty at all, just because people have tattoos doesn't make them dirty.  In fact the times my sons and I decide to eat there instead of taking pizza home, they've gone out of their way to make sure we had a good experience.  It's the best pizza around and the fries are great too."
"The staff at West Valley Imaging are professional, accomodating and kind. I have seen them change the channel  for a patient as well as raise the volume for his advanced age. They have treated me well the few times I have been there. Most recently I went in for an MRI. My first. I was not really nervous about it but if I had been, I would have been calmed by the technician who spoke smooth, soft and gentel. It was almost irritating how kind he was. Especially when I asked him to pull me out twice. Once because I got dizzy. Once because I had to cough. The whole time he remained calm and understanding. I don't much like getting medical tests done but if I have to get any imaging done, I choose West Valley Imaging."
"Eating at a Chinese restaurant when you come all the way from Cali to Vegas is random right? I thought so too, but it turned out that one of my cousins just moved there and since we were in town (to gamble...lol) they decided to treat us out at KJ Kitchen.\n\nThe outside of the restaurant needs a serious face lift to match it's amazing food. \n\nI can't name all the dishes we ate, but it doesn't matter because I'm sure anything you order from here will be delicious! Their crab fried rice was, hands down, the best fried rice I've ever eaten. Sorry mom :p And their lobster was also very tasty and they have forks ready for people like me who are chopstick challenged.\n\nThe only iffy thing about this place was the fish tank full of dead-looking fish... and it's placed right in front so you can see it when you walk through the doors. Hope that doesn't scare you away though because their food is awesome!"
"The first time I visited Madison was for a job interview and my employer put me up in the Edgewater.  Unfortunately, I can't recall my room having a lake view, but the accommodations were pleasant and front staff helpful.  \n\nAfter getting picked up at MSN in the Edgewater limo (how pimp is that?), I ducked into the bar for some late eats and to see what was going on.  Strangely enough, there were a gaggle of dentists in semi-formal wear celebrating the end of a dentist convention.  I didn't stick around too long.  Food and drinks--good.  Hotel--good.  4 stars."
"""This bar is tucked away on train tracks and not quite what is considered \""""downtown.\"""" But it is the definition of a hidden gem. Mostly a tiny sports bar, you can feel the history here, and you really drink it in...\n\nFood is available, and it's typical bar fare, but just link the drinks, the price is right. They have slot machines, as any classic Wisconsin bar should have. The Long Islands are good, but if the place wants a 5-star rating, they have to upgrade the televisions. Other than that, stop in for any Kohl center event and you won't be disappointed. I don't think it gouges you like any of the Regent bars on football Saturdays, either."""
"The pizza was cheap and tasty, and best of all: HAND TOSSED.  However, anyone who has visited Chicago, would never give their pizza 5 stars... that should be reserved for truly great pizza."
"""Friendly,fast good breakfast - right price.\nMusic overhead 3 Dog Night- \""""momma told me not to come\""""\n Coming next time thru town!"""
"Updated 3/2012. Their flights of wine and service are still good but on my last two visits I thought their food quality had slipped a bit so I think a four star rating is now appropriate.  Sorry I could not agree with Mariangela. My experiences there have all been good. Their flights of wine are always fun to try and I have never had a bad meal there. I do agree that the service is very friendly and pretty professional. \nIt is a good restaurant to bring guests to as they always seem to enjoy the evening. The parking is valet, but not snobbish as they parked by old pickup right up front."
"Have been to this and the Scottsdale location several times. Good food and laid back atmosphere. Sometimes you might have to wait longer than you would like for a refill or to pay your bill, but generally the service is decent. \n\nI usually get the fried catfish plate with Mac n cheese and greens. Have also tried the waffle sandwich. Stepped outside the box once or twice and got the shrimp n grits and the salmon croquettes. Not impressed with either. Also wish they had peach cobbler."
"""Maybe this place is a bit expensive, but it's definitely along the lines of good Whole Foods bread (ahem... if there were actually a Whole Foods in CU, we'd have a better basis of comparison than Schnucks and Meijer) and other \""""fancy bakery\"""" bread I've purchased in the past.  \n\nI've had a few of the pastries (mmm chocolate croissant on the way home from the gym, don't mind if I do...) but the bread is what we come here for!  The sourdough is pretty good (trust me, that's a compliment; I'm a sourdough snob) and the ciabatta is just right.  \n\nPerhaps I have yet to encounter the rude employees working here-- so far they have been pleasant enough.  I just wish they were open on Sundays!!!"""
"If your Miata is acting out, Mike's place is the spot you can trust to straighten up.  Mike is probably the most friendliest Miata Guru that I know, very honest and really reliable.  thanks, Mike!"
"Not too many bad things to say about this location.  Every time I've gone I've gotten what I asked for.  It seems to be fairly clean; I've noticed nothing to make me think otherwise.  The service was fast and friendly so, yeah, no complaints really."
"Just had the jerk wing dings.... Mouth watering and hot as a furnace, but strangely I can not get enough... I ordered 5 for $4 and I was excited with that... Promise this will knock you right out of your socks... The service is a little slow but perfection sometimes takes time... Never had a bad experience with fireside..."
"I hate taking my car to a mechanic because of bad experience. We have been customers here for over ten years. My husband always took our cars to get serviced. This time I had to take my car since the break engine light came on. \nWhen I arrived to Mr Brake they were closing up. I told the owner what my problem was. He went back in his shop got a tools, told me to open the hood and looked at my car filled it up with brake fluid and told me that I was ok to drive it but to come back in the morning so he can check the brakes. He didn't charge me anything just told me to come back.\nHe could have told me. He was closed. To come back tomorrow. I really appreciated what he did for me. He is a very carrying and honest person.\nNext morning I was there. He worked on my car changed the back brakes. I was very happy by the way he treated me. \nThank you Mr Brake."
So I had my labor day weekend vacation in Vegas. We've been eating in Treasure Island (where we were staying) for two days straight and my old man was dying for some L.A. seafood. My aunt from LV told us about this place. Tonight we made it at around 7:30PM. The place is small. We ordered:\n\n-Seafood tofu egg soup (very good)\n-Lobster and Crab combo (very good about $35; very fresh)\n-Snow pea leaf garlic stir fry (WoW. my top list have must have vegie)\n-Fermented black bean clam (very good)\n-Half of white chicken (not good at all; way too tough)\n\nService was crazy good. They keep checking our tea and rice. Kept changin our plate out. \n\nTotal: ~$82
"""5 Stars for being the oldest arena in the NHL.  I was blessed, blessed, blessed to be invited to attend game 5 of the Pens-Sens series in the very last hockey season to played here.   Since I'm officially a Buffalonian, I refused to swing my Terrible Towel (gratis upon entering) but \""""reluctantly\"""" cheered against the Sens.  That's all I'm saying.\n\nIt is obviously not a 5-star arena but I'm giving the experience 5 stars.  Old school hockey arena; if you trip you're gonna tumble down onto the ice.  Perfunctory concrete concourses.  Narrow, claustrophobic halls to the suites.  Teensy, tiny suites with 4 stadium seats and standing room for the rest.  Yes, standing room for the 11 other attendees.   And no private bathrooms! OMG!\n\nIf I could add an extra star for being able to drink during double? triple? overtime, I would.   I walked all the way hotel with my vodka/cran."""
"YUMMMM. i live in socal so i definitely know my way around a delicious, authentic mexican joint but i will tip my hat off to Roberto's. after a drunken night, i ordered 4 carnitas tacos and was shocked when i looked at my meal. HOLY SHIT. these tacos are HUGE ! and STACKED with meat ! with guacamole! i barely finished 2. the only reason i knock off a star is that i think they're meat can be a littleee bit more salty. oh, and their hot sauce kind of sucks. i'm obsessed with king taco style hot sauce and theirs is probably the exact opposite of that. still looking forward to eating here on my next vegas trip"
"I am from California and have never been to Babe's, but I can tell you that I will be going there next time I visit Madison WI.  They searched for me over the web because they found a check that I wrote to someone for their graduation and they had lost it.  \n\nThank you to the customer of Babe's that turned it in too!  Babe's....good people and good customers!!!\n\nGod Bless!!!\nRKR"
"Que Rico!!!\n\nMmm the empanadas. I'm so glad I eat chicken now because they are mouth watering. Being Argentinian, it would be super embarrassing if I were unable to enjoy some of the amazing dishes this place has to offer.  Its still embarrassing that I don't eat beef but whatever.  (I do stare at people eating milanesas longingly, I'm sure its creepy) I enjoy the pastries the most and sometimes if I'm driving in china town I'll pop in and grab a delicioso dulce de leche alfajor or three. \n\nThere aren't many authentic south american places in town, and there aren't ANY Argentinian delis at all..so yeah I guess this is one of your only options. Soo, it's probably a good thing that it is AWESOME. Go!"
"Not much to say - it's just delicious. And they were extremely patient with my friend who was having trouble with the menu, even as the line was stretching out the door. Not a single person, even the staff, seemed to mind the line, and it was clear after my experience (and the food) why no one minded."
Some of the food was amazing!\n\nThe fried chicken - amazing!  The oxtail with red wine - the sauce was amazing but there was practically no meat on the bones... Fried rice and noodle were all good. I was with my girls and they could not believe they didn't have orange chicken on the menu... \n\nI have come to not expect good service anywhere in Chinatown.  The cultural/language barrier is just something that doesn't mean bad - I think it is just different.  \n\nThis would be a good place to go with a group of friends and order a bunch of different items.\n\nThe fish tanks with the pathetic sea creatures was interesting.  Do they prepare the dead fish just floating there??? I don't think I would feature this in the front of a restaurant.  It is far from appetizing.\n\nAnyways - I like this place. Reasonable prices and authentic style Chinese...
Love the Akins plate and it's the only thing I get when I come here. The inside is small and I usually don't like to eat inside the restaurant because the food smell gets on your clothes. Other than that it's quality food and fast service at a great price.
"Echoing the last review...it's good! it's cheap! My $4.50 Mediterranean Sandwich wasn't perfect, but it was tasty, fresh, and large. \n\nThe small mug for water is a touch annoying, and I always feel like a bull in a china shop trying to get through their tiny space.\n\nOverall, an excellent place for lunch, especially if one likes hummus! Great hummus."
"I guess the reviews on here are somewhat mixed, but I love this restaurant.  Their ravioli is delicious.  Although, now that I think about it, I'd probably eat ravioli off the floor of a prison."
"Don't go to Subway!\nVito, pepe and tuna subs\nAnd the bread is good!*\n\n*and I don't even like bread"
"This place is sooo good!!  You can order anything on the menu and it will be outstanding.  The only thing that was terrible was that the food was so fresh and so hot that you cant immediately dig in and eat (I burnt my mouth on the chicken, lol).  It smelt soo good that I couldn't wait for it to cool down.  But I would rather have my food extremely fresh and hot!"
"Based on the previous yelp customer reviews I tried M & I for a battery replacement.   Quick and friendly service, I was in and out in 5 minutes. Cost was only $10.75, much cheaper and quicker than the Galleria Mall watch repair store.  Easy to get to off the I-15 freeway at Spring Mountain.\n\nI used another jeweler on Fort Apache for 2 MK watches link removal and felt ripped off.  I will use M & I for future watch repair."
"This Sonic is one of the better ones that ive been to. The food quality doesnt suffer even if the drive thru line is long and they are knocking out the cars. I prefer the Onion RIngs over the fries. Though there fries are still good. But the Onion rings are a little crispy but still soft and come out piping hot and greasy. Not all dry and burnt like some onion rings at a other establishment who will remain nameless. There is a Mcdonalds on the other corner but come on its a No Brainer where to go, when you want Scrumptous sandwiches. Delicious Desserts. Onion rings that will make you googley eyed. Drinks deserving of a king. And they are open late and i love the happy hour menu."
"Stopped in here for some camera assistance during the protest.   They were so busy they forgot to lock the door at closing and people were still coming in.  They were very nice about it, worked with the customers and were very patient for us to finish our shopping and make our purchases."
"The pool is pretty small, but it's indoors, and the kids didn't seem to care about the size, and the whirlpool is is luxurious. Our view of the Terrace and lake was equally uxorious.\n\nThis place is wedding central on weekends in the summer. You can just watch wedding parties and guests going up and down the elevators all day and night. Could be an interesting photo project.\n\nMy only complaint is that they didn't seem to want to give us extra blankets, maybe they intuited that we would use them for make shift beds for the kids, instead of paying a lot of money for cots.\n\nBut when we forgot a few things in the room, they mailed them to us free of charge. That's service!"
"The lady below must have been in on an off day.   I hope she gives them another shot because I've been shopping here for years without an issue.   Whenever I shop here they are very friendly and helpful to me.  I am always greeted, let alone to roam around and browse (no pressure sales pitch), and they give me assitance if I need it.  I like this boutique and have some great pieces when I want to spoil myself."
"I moved to Henderson in March and it had been 6 months since my last cut.  I was desperate for a hair cut!  But I wanted it done right and at the right price.  So I did a lot of research and eventually went here because of a discount for new clients they offered on their website at the time.  Rachel cut my hair and I love it.  The cut turned out great, the color was exactly what I wanted.  I'll be coming back here again.  Thanks!"
This is the only place to go for fried chicken!
"Went here after having my hair butchered by a barber down the street. Nate fixed it right up. Just moved to town from Cali, won't look anywhere else for a barber. This place is clean, and Nate is a grade A barber."
"I am going to take this down from 5 to 4 stars because it has been uneven as of late. Sometimes service is a bit slower or the food isn't quite as good, but this is till a very good place to dine."
"Best Burger really does have some of the best burgers. I haven't been in a while, mainly due to the fact that I moved and they just have the weirdest hours, but it is still what I think of when I think of a good burger. I tried it because my school was in the area, and it used to deliver for lunch (what can I say, I loathe cafeteria food) for free, so I figured why not give it a try. I had (and continue to eat) their bacon cheeseburger, which is huge by the way. The bacon is fresh and the meat is juicy. The sauce... oh the sauce... I eat it on my french fries and with the burger. Their desserts include milkshakes (although they spell(ed) it deserts for the longest) and their oreo is pretty good if you don't want to travel to Sonic. Oh, I miss the Japanese-American owners who always smiled when our club from school walked in, but I shall return."
"A couple co-workers and I popped into the separate lounge area of Sammy's on W. Sahara for happy hour.  The bartender was very friendly and the pours of wine were generous.  It is a little dark inside but that is expected for a bar/lounge.  There were just a few people in the bar so the noise level was quiet which was great.  A couple people were gambling but the machine volume was turned way down so that was also pleasant.  Right when we ordered our last drink, a group of people came into the bar and one or more of them was smoking.  Not cool.  The bar didn't smell like smoke when we first got there so I assumed that it was a smoke free establishment."
"Who knew you could get GOOD all you can eat sushi in the middle of the desert? \n\nI sure didn't until I started YELPING around and found this little gem!\n\nI'm in Vegas working a conference this week, and my colleagues and I were looking for a nice, reasonably priced option for dinner. \n\nWe thought Japanese sounded good, so I started looking and found Tokyo Japanese restaurant. Unfortunately, I can't eat fish anymore (digestive stuff) but the rest of my party said the quality was top notch (and it sure looked good!)...\n\nThey also have some teriyaki and breaded katsu pork cutlets. These weren't AS good - but come on, it's a sushi place. Totally reasonable for all you can eat (and includes salads, meso soup and a scoop of ice cream!) anywhere---let alone just off the strip in Vegas!\n\nCheck it out if you're craving sushi but don't wanna pay crazy Vegas prices! It's a little tough to find, but worth the search!"
"I really feel comfortable and pampered here. I've never enjoyed mani's and pedi's before because no one really explained what I was supposed to do. Linda, who first helped me, was very patient and explained everything. Only lost one star because sometimes they take too many walk-ins."
"I think I'm writing about Vietnamese places too much, but I just love Pho.  I tried the beef stew here.  A bit more oily than to my liking.  However, it still had a good kick to it.  The Cha Gio (Egg Rolls) were a bit more crispy than Pho So 1's, but better than Pho Kim Long's.  I didn't get to try the pho here yet, but I did get the Bun Bi (Vermicelli Noodles with lemongrass beef and vegetables).  It's just as good as any other place.  The place is clean, the waiters are prompt in the beginning, but kind of forget about you later on.  Still, I didn't need much.  Too bad I can't give a 3.5 star rating, but I'll edge them out to a 4."
"I know there have been a lot of people saying that the Penguin is not the same since it reopened. Well I completely disagree. We went there for dinner the other night because I really wanted a good burger and fries. There was hardly anyone in the place. This may be one of the best, if not the best burger I have EVER had...and I love my burgers! Being from New Jersey I only discovered fried pickles a few years ago and let me tell you I think they are one of the greatest things out there so when I saw them on the menu I had to give them a try. They did not disappoint. They were perfectly breaded and practically melted in your mouth. I think everyone needs give it another try."
"Good dive bar with excellent jukebox choices, comedy nights, cheap drinks, gambling, and an older woman with a pretty nice body serving you stiff drinks.\n\nThe reason I mention the woman is that I personally think most girls in LV have the ugliest bodies I've ever seen (yes, including locals.)\n\nWe're not talking fat, cuz that comes with tourists. I'm talking slim girls that have ZERO definition, tone, or muscle to their legs. When an older woman is beating you guys out, it's time to change your routines.\n\nAnyway, back to the bar... most folks know I dont like bars, but this place is cool! Give it a whirl!"
"I am a regular here because of the convenience of the location for me. I do like it better than other ones I've been to but they don't seem to restock some sections very often.. perhaps because those are the sections that don't sell well? I'm not sure, but I can deal with it. Friendly people MOST of the time."
"Portions are huge!  Food is soooooo yummy!\nThe chile verde is soooooo yummy and the spuds are sooooo yummy!\nEverything that I have ever tried has been yummy.\nBut they do all the dollar to change this, dollar to add that, and not say anything about it.  That bugs me, if you are going to charge extra for something give me a heads up.\nOther than that the service and food are great!"
"Mason jars of sweet tea done right, juicy and tender fried chicken with perfectly crispy skin, mac and cheese that doesn't teeter into absurd hoity-toityness, and waffles that are just thin enough to soak up the maximum amount of butter and syrup.\n\nWhat's not to love?  Maybe the fact that I went from diabetic coma to sugar crash, skipping the high that usually comes in between.\n\nI didn't even have room for red velvet, but that's a mistake I won't make twice."
"I have eaten here a few times, not as much as I would like. \n\nGreat sense of community here.\n\nAmazing home style cooking, the guy in the back really knows what hes doing.\n\nQuick, friendly, attentive service.\n\nGood looking chicks that work here.\n\nPrices are great once you taste the food and realize how much effort and care they put behind it.\n\nWhat else can you look for in a little diner cafe?"
"Decent food! Good service considering how busy it is. Average drink selection. I like the location of this place but it can get a bit crowded and noisy depending on the night. I feel like a bigger space would allow for a better experience since it is a hot spot in NoDa and let's face it: there's just not enough room for everybody! Still give this place four stars though, because these are just minor setbacks. The salsa is fresh and super chunky! Probably one of the best food items."
"Absolutely delicious. Each cup is a giant sugar bomb but yum-yum-yummy. The parking lot/neighborhood is a LITTLE shady at night, but it's nothing bad. It's just DAMN good custard."
"Since I live about 10 feet away from this Wal-mart, I've been forced to grow pretty close to it. I walk into it about 2 times a week and usually the experience is surprisingly good for a Wal-mart. Always a cultural experience, Wal-Mart Eastway satisfies basic needs, keeps a pretty decent stock, and has, well, average customer service (thats kind of a lie, but its Wal-Mart, not Nordstroms). Among the bad, the family Honda Accord was stolen out of the parking lot 2 years ago and there was no video footage or security help, luckily it was later recovered, and the alarm system goes off most of the time because of various incompetent removals of tags at the register, but you gotta love the prices. I've never had return problems and the clothing section is really great actually."
"My parents always took us to South 21 starting in the EARLY 60's, I also took my kids. I have since moved away but when I'm in Charlotte this is the 1st place we go. I grew up loving the burgers, onion rings, slaw,Trout and chicken! My days of long trips are about over and I will truly miss South 21. I would love to have the recipe for their breading for the fish, chicken and onion rings."
"This place is totally Madison rich people food. It's expensive but delicious. There are only a few meat options, but that means it's vegetarian friendly. It's not full service, so not full tipping makes it cheaper (though most people will tip the same here anyways. Way to work the market). The place is always full for brunch so that means you're at a place that other people want to eat. If you get tired of the long lines to wait through you can always people watch. It's all eccentric people and pretty girls.\n\nTLDR; If you like five star reviews you'll like this place."
Just moved into town. I am sick ( sore throat and fever). Needed a good wonton soup. Rolled the dice with this Chinese restaurant and WON big time!!! Amazing homemade wonton soup! Delicious!!
"My favorite building/complex in all of U of I.  It was here a very shy psychology student accidently enrolled in an acting class for acting performance majors only, and was forced to play multiple parts in a play with MFA students in the audience.  I have never been scared of groups since.  I also caught Leslie Nielsen here doing a one man play of Clarence Darrow, multiple operas and symphonies, plays plays plays, and accidently stumbled upon the dressing/rehearsal area of a Parisian ballet troup.  Ah the memories.  Krannerts main hall has some of the best acoustics for music that have ever heard.  The smaller theatres are great for plays and small performances.\n\nGo to events here!  you won't regret it.  Take a class here an you won't forget it.\n\n(yeah rhyming, lame, I know)"
"If you're never in Fitchburg, you would probably never even know this place exists. It's in a strip mall behind the Walgreen's at PD and Fish Hatchery, tucked between a Pizza Hut and the UPS Store. But don't let the odd location fool you. It's definitely worth the drive, even if you have no other reason to venture to that part of town.\n\nI met a friend here for lunch when I moved to Madison about 2 years ago, and it's been love ever since. The sandwiches are so fresh, made with bread from their own bakery. The white chicken chili is fantastic. And the baked goods are to die for. Seriously. Angels sing while you're looking at their displays. \n\nIf we need a cake for a special occasion, this is where we go to get it."
"Just take my money... I can't seem to leave Costco for under $100. LOL\n\nCostco seriously has everything you could possibly need... High quality food, cheap gas, wine, a great bakery, frozen foods for days, canned goods, caskets (WTF), tires, home goods, furniture, electronics, an optometrist, pharmacy, and so on and so on... It's the only place on Earth (that I know of) that you can walk out with a pair of Hudson jeans, big ass ribeye steaks, and a new set of tires for your car in one trip. \n\nPro tip: You do not need a Costco membership to use the pharmacy."
"This sort of drive-in is a vanishing breed. Rather than going in to eat, or pulling through a window in a hurry, you pull up to the box and try and get everyone to look at a tiny menu. Then someone brings it out to you and you figure out how everyone will get what they ordered and eat it in the tiny space of your vehicle. Awesome, and that is just the experience.\n\nAs to the food? Very respectable, especially if you stick with the burgers. Perhaps even some of the best in town, keeping in mind that these are not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination. Just straight up simple hamburgers, and that's the way they should be done sometimes.\n\nWhile other South 21 locations (notably the one in Matthews) take credit cards, not sure if this one does - at the very least, you're making someone walk a good distance. You might want to take cash."
"I have always received good, prompt service here.  The doctors aren't forced to see five patients an hour, so they are much less rushed and more willing to slow down and answer your questions.  I have always found my caretakers' intentions and plans for me easy to understand, and reasonable.\n\nThe student health plan that comes with tuition (which covers all appointments, and most of your medications) was able to be extended over the summer for just a little over $100.  This is a big deal to someone who isn't relying on their parents for their health care costs.\n\nAs a former patient of Carle, I'll always be tempted to compare my care at McKinley to theirs.  In that respect, I feel much more comfortable and cared-for than I did at Carle.  The comparatively small number of patients allows them to be more considerate to each patient."
"Fast service and honest work.  Didn't try and sell me on more than I needed, and they could have considering what the problem was.  I would certainly bring my car here again.  Open on Saturdays, which was a huge plus in my situation, since I really needed my car back.  Great work!"
"I was referred to Biketek by a friend as this was the 1st time getting into the sport. I knew exactly what bike I wanted to purchase as a beginning rider. They ordered it & gave me the best price around without the BS of talking me up to something I didn't want. In subsequent visits for adjustment & accessories, they have charged me a fair price for services & have been helpful with any questions I've had about riding & the bike itself. \n\nThere seems to be a lot of store choices in the area so I recommend checking Biketek out first."
"This is one of the coolest places you will set foot in. The most difficult part is getting there. Actually that isn't even true. Getting in is not the hard part. Getting out is the hard part, because the lot is so, so small, and you have to back out onto Providence Road when you leave. Let's skip that for now.\n\nThe good part is when you're inside it's like an old-time grocery, but instead of just about everything, it's focused on Italian food. Specifically pasta. You can get just about anything, and you place your order up front, and many times - though not all - they will zip your pasta from the back along a pasta zip line to the front. That alone is the price of admission (which to be fair, is free).\n\nThough fresh pasta may not be worth the drive - or the maneuvering of the parking lot - it is definitely worth checking out the place. They also have all sorts of oils, wines, cheeses and the like. If you haven't gone, you owe it to yourself to visit at least once."
"I seriously eat breakfast here a couple of times a month.  They have a few healthy options.  You can get an egg white omelet half portion.  Sometimes I even manage to force myself to order it.  Usually though, I get the eggs benedict and grub like a lumberjack.  No this place is not trendy.  Your food will not be served on small plates and it will not be innovative.  But what you will get is super huge portions, good food, GREAT coffee which is constantly being refilled and reasonable prices.  This place is a Vegas institution and I love it!\n\nWhile you may not be a fatty if you skip it, you're a fool if you miss out on the homemade pumpkin bread."
"Hole in the wall Thai food place in a strip mall next to multi-racial, yet segregated, sex clubs. WIN.\n\nA deliciously large serving of chicken Pad See Yew. WIN.\n\nScrumptious fried spring rolls to start us off. WIN.\n\nVegan friendly. WIN.\n\nRemarkably well kept bathrooms that have waterfalls and smell like Asian flowers. WIN.\n\nSemi sort of fast (not really) service. Partial WIN. I mean...we got our food eventually (-1 star).\n\nComplete satiating of a mad Thai food craving. WIN.\n\nEating Thai food three hours before our dinner reservation at Craft Steaks. FAIL."
"Cheap, quick, delicious. I don't think much more explanation is needed. On the weekend the place fills up quickly so be ready to stand and wait. Before you order 3 pancakes be warned. They aren't IHOP sized."
"They have great food and the servers and bartenders are always there to help. It's on a college campus so expect the atmosphere. Don't be like that Matthew U guy and talk about how you went in college, then go back and complain about it being a college bar because that's sort of cunty. Try the kitchen sink wing sauce because it's amazing!"
"I came here to get new running shoes, as I was having shin splints after I ran with the shoes I had. I worked with Brad, who was extremely helpful! He evaluated my walking and running stride, and looked at my current shoes, which were actually working against my natural stride. He brought me 4 different shoes to try, and was very patient while I tried them all out in various order and combinations. Once I decided on a pair, we discussed other methods of helping out my shin splints and muscle pains and he suggested a few accessories to help out. All in all this took only about 20 minutes. I've run about 12 miles since I got my new shoes, and I have been very very pleased with my purchase! I highly recommend Run for your Life, and ask for Brad! Though everyone there is awesome from the other interactions I overheard!"
"3.5 rounded up.  This is a basic bakery that charges cheap prices.  I ordered the cruller, apple burrito, and a couple of donut holes.  I thought all were good enough.  I do prefer krispy kreme.  Has a good following; the place had a steady stream of customers while i was there."
"It's a shame that the majority of the locations have shut down.  I believe this was the original location in Charlotte and still is a great place for a great beer and good food.  Obviously they brew their own beer here and the selection has never let me down.  I particularly love the Lightning Bolt Gold and it's one of the only locations near my house in Monroe, NC where you can get a growler to go.  Service is great and the food selections range from $30-$10 a plate so from burgers and sandwiches all the way to fresh fish dishes and great steak dinners."
"Had surgery yesterday morning for breast aug. I normally hate going to the doctor but dr alexander and his staff couldn't have been more comforting or professional. They made me and my husband feel informed and comfortable about all decisions we made. Went waaayyyyy above and beyond at all steps in my process.\n\nDr alexander, his nurse Lynn, and Ashely are who I worked with most and they were all amazing. Dr alexander called me himself the day before surgery to make sure everything was in order and I had no questions. The anesthesiologist from Surgical Center at Tenaya also called me to make sure everything was good. \n\nOverall, an amazing experience, I couldn't have asked for any better."
I like the food and portions here. The prices are also decent considering what you get. Don't like that there's no refills on drinks. The dessert empanadas are really good and the pupusas are fresh and tasty. I wouldn't order appetizers because the meals are pretty big. Most times I will share with my daughter. I have also purchased vouchers.
"""If you clip out the coupon from the newspaper,(Saturday editions)  you can eat for half price with players card.  Check out what is being served on what nights and you can get steak, prime rib, shrimp, clam strips, Asian, Mexican, American and a decent desert station,  and they always have turkey or roast beef.  Anyone that complains about the quality of food for the price has to be dissatisfied about something else.  I agree that it's not a \""""10\"""" but it is worth more than what you pay.  You can find something here that will satisfy the budget and your appitite.  This may not be the top of the line buffet in Las Vegas but it certainly is a bargain.  This is a locals buffet and that should tell you something.  Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays are my favorite days to eat there, exspecially Saturdays when they have the Prime Rib.  Breakfast and Dinner buffets are the better bargains."""
This is the only place that you will not be ripped off . You will get the best service in Las Vegas.
"High-quality shoes for your broken feet. \nNo, let's revise that: you use your feet all the time. They hold you up. Look at them, way down there...they need some love too! So healthy shoes are not just for the elderly and wise, but also for the smart people who plan to continue walking.\n\nPrices are pretty high, but service is excellent (not pushy) and they really want you to feel good. Orthopedic shoes abounds! If you have any medical foot problems, come here. \nMaybe a little less fashionable, but hey, take what you can get. I've found quite a few comfy and stylish pairs here."
"""More noodles than you can comprehend, Pho bouillon, Sriracha bottles bigger than your head, odd canned drinks to the tune of \""""Sac Sac\"""" with flavors ranging from ginger to \""""spongy grass juice,\"""" gummy candies, waving cat statues, vibrantly colored toys, and a brilliant butchery. \n\nParking can suck, but just find a spot around either side of the building.\n\nVeg section seems to be lacking a bit more than usual these days, but not a huge deal. Still love coming here. \n\nAlso, if you're planning on stopping in for a quick bite or preserved duck eggs, make sure you have at least $10 worth of goodies to meet their minimum for running a credit/debit card."""
"If the Supreme Court ever approves human + appetizer marriage, I will immediately propose to the chips and guac at Jolly Bob's because I want to spend the rest of my life with them. \n\nGood drinks, good food. Service a little slow, but it was a busy Friday."
"The breakfast here is very good.  I usually order egg white omelettes and one time I got egg beaters which I didn't like too much.  Hence the 4 stars not 5.  I just wish they would tell people if that's only what they have or if the chef working won't do egg whites.\n\nEven after this I still have to give it 4 stars because they have the best french toast I have ever  had in my life!  I don't even enjoy sweets, but for some reason I wanted french toast and I'm glad I ordered it.  \n\nThe crust is so crispy and the middle is so soft.  It was so perfect with the little butter that was on it and the warm syrup.  Texture and Taste was unbeatable.  I really don't see how they could make it any better."
"Close to my work, prices and availability of supplies are ample stock. The tool guys sure know their stuff and the self serve cash registers are conveniently located at the front and middle of the store.  I wished some things would not be replaced unnoticed."
"The carpets came out great and dried quicker than expected. I wanted to give them 5 stars, but Luis was clearly disappointed when I didn't go for the upsell."
"The first time I visited Diamond was thirty years ago. I been eating here from time to time for past thirty years.\n\nThey have two menu; one is Americanized version of Chinese food. IE. Sweet and sour pork, ...orange beef.... Mongolian beef...etc\n\nThe other menu;  ( a sheet of pink paper with Chinese writing). Food in this menu is intended for Ethnic Chinese or Ethnic Asian. They offer the most authentic Southern Chinese food in town. Hefty portion very Delicious  and super low price. Food on this menu ... absolutely 5 star.\n\nDecor is mediocre at best. but acceptable.\n\nCleanliness . Among the worst. However, If Diamond was to compare only with other Chinese restaurants. Then its not so bad. \n\nThis place have potential to be TOP authentic Chinese restaurant  if they are willing to spend more that a nickle for decors and do some clean up."
"Anywhere you have a decently sized Vietnamese community.. you can count on Pho restaurants being around... and typically there is going to be much more than one of them.. So how does one decide which one to go to??? Family, close friends, and the help of Yelp reviews are what I usually go off of.\n\nSo this little gem way off the strip.. and past I dunno how many other pho restuarants along the way.. was suggested to me by my family about a year ago and still remains to be one of my favorite pho places to go to while in Vegas.\n\nWhat typically differentiates pho restuarants from each other is the combination quality and freshness of the ingredients, how everything is cooked.. but most of all, the broth.\n\nThere's no doubt that most people tend to add hoisin sauce, sriracha, lime, and various other condiments to cater to one's taste... but you certainly need a solid foundation to begin with... and the broth here is most definitely done very well."
"I needed to fix a silver link on my wife's necklace. I found the store inYelp near my location. I walked in, they fixed it in 5 mins and I was out the door very pleased."
"Gino is a great hair stylist.  Really never had a better haircut in living memory. Very fast, perfect contours, will last almost forever without losing it's shape--so it's actually cheaper than some suggest. But I think the price is a steal. Find a cheaper place one tenth as good and I'll follow you there--and pay for you haircut too!  In short:  it doesn't get better than this. It 'feels' like a barber shop, but provide quality that only the best of the best salons could even come close to."
"Picked up a loaf of raisin walnut bread, and have been eating it as a snack. They don't skimp on the raisins or the walnuts. \n\nAlso tried a large chocolate chip cookie...decent, but not the best I've had.\n\nMy boyfriend had a walnut brownie which he enjoyed."
Those who like shopping at Best Buy won't have any issues here.  The employees are helpful without being pushy.  There is a lot of parking so it's just a matter of how close you'll be to the store.  The men's restroom was clean.  There are other stores but plan to do quite a bit of walking if you want to visit a lot of them.
Had a slow leak in the right front tire. They fixed that but also checked my spare to make sure it was in good shape and had proper pressure. That was unexpected and very cool. That's why I keep coming back.
"Have been going here for 6-7 years and really like this vet.  The Williston's are genuinely concerned about our kitty and I never get the feeling that they are recommending services just to make an extra buck.  Our kitty is now a senior citizen and meows all the time, they have spent ample time discussing this with us in an honest effort to help Kitty feel more happy and peaceful. Some things have worked and some not, but they are willing to just keep trying.  That's really nice."
The five stars is not so much a function of the hotel as of the very friendly and helpful staff.  \n\nAs hotels go this one is fine.  The rooms are comfortable and the amenities are decent.  They seem to have made some effort in improving the complimentary breakfast in the last year which is a good thing.\n\nBut the real draw has been the staff.  Always friendly and helpful.  On our last visit there was a significant snag with our reservation that technically could have caused us to be billed twice for the room through no fault of theirs.  However the front desk manager was able to quickly and without any fuss resolve the matter and keep me from getting hit quite hard in the wallet.  \n\nThat kind of service earns my loyalty and we will be staying there any time we are in Madison going forward.
Chi Tea... Yumm!\nFirst time at this location. The seating area could use a bit more attention. All of the garbage cans were full. Staff was very friendly and quick to get me my order.
I work graveyard shift and order food from here 2-3 times a week. I have tried most of the menu and can't think of anything that I didn't like. The service is friendly and every time I call they remember me by name.
"CAPASTRAMI! DO IT, DO IT! this sandwich was all i hoped for after reading the rave reviews from the yelpers. Tasty loads of pastrami nestled in a perfect bun by itself would be just fine for me. BUT, they through a heaping helping of coleslaw on top and it becomes decadence in your hand. I loved it. Unfortunately my wife got the cole turkey and hated it. I tasted it and it just tasted like tuna salad to me, not my fav. \nCAPASTRAMI is the way to go for sure, i'll be back next time i roll through Vegas for sure. \n\nPS..I do hate when restaurants don't have fountain drinks, it's cheap and lame."
"""At this store at Woodlawn and Park Road you will find a lot of wine.  A LOT of wine.  They probably have the largest selection in Charlotte.  And beer.  I don't buy wine often but if the grocery store or my other local options become less exciting I know where to go.\n\nFor liquor you have to go to the ABC around the corner.  I know, I know.  There are no wine and spirits shops in Mecklenberg County.  We'll get through it.  All together now, \""""Plan two stops... plan two stops... plan two stops... plan two stops...\"""""""
Whenever we have guests from out of town we always get them to try the friend chicken experience of Bojangles and more importantly.... Prices Chicken Coop.\n\nWhen I first heard about this place from my dad it was hard for me to grasp the concept.... you just have to try the chicken. It's not dine in... just take out but the line is out the door for a reason.\n\nI am not a liver person.... but I hear their fried liver is the best. I'm just in it for the chicken. It's unique and tasty.
"I love the food here! Everything I've ever had has impressed me. The main dishes, the sides, everything. DELISH. The service, however, definitely leaves a LOT to be desired. Tonight, we waited a while at the register before anyone even said hello. And the food took a while to come out. We ordered from here last month for a work function. When I came to pick it up, they had lost my entire order. They gave me a 10% discount for the inconvenience, but come on!"
This particular store is like the lost and forgotten one. I actually forgot that this store was still here until the semiannual sale left me scouring for BBWs with larger inventory. This place had all I needed and then some! It's a larger store than the usual BBW with plenty of room to walk around and sample. The sales people were  friendly and helpful too!
"I've had several piercings done here - the service has been great every time. Yes, I can agree with other Yelpers that sometimes the staff can be slighty condescending with their words of advice, but seriously? Get over it, they're just doing their job. \n\nJewelry selection is fabulous and the prices are reasonable. I recently ordered a nose ring and after waiting several weeks for it to arrive, I get it home to find that it is way too big! I figured because all jewelry is a final sale an exchange would be hopeless, but I called and explained (and I think they were leniant due mostly to the fact that they recommended the size, but still) and they exchanged it for me no problem."
"First time trying a Primanti Bros. sandwich and I was not disappointed. I came in after seeing the show featured on numerous television programs and through word of mouth. I wasn't sure what to order at first, but the employees were super nice and explained each sandwich and just what I'd get. I ended up with the pastrami and cheese with egg and fries and coleslaw and, wowie, it was just spectacular. It was a bit messy, but that's par for the course with these types of sandwiches. The price of a $7 plus sandwich seemed hi at first but made more sense after I could barely eat half. Could have been a by cleaner, but I'm reaching here. Go eat here at least once in your life."
"The best sports bar in America. This is a SPORTS BAR, people. Not a restaurant, not a bar to go to on a Wednesday night, so stop rating it as such. It's a place to go watch the games and it is amazing."
"This Noodles is close to work, and I have eaten lunch or ordered carry out from this location 25 times in the last 2 years.  Service is always prompt, food is good quality, and they've only goofed up my carry out twice.  The second time I had ordered a med salad with grilled chicken only to find no chicken when I got back to the office.  I called and the manager made it right with me by sending 2 free Noodles bowl gift certificates via email.  Pretty happy with the way they conduct business, and will continue to eat there.  Clean tables and washrooms as well."
"thank you yelpers, this really helped in the 100 degree weather! never would dared to try the place on my own w/ its dingy house-like exterior. The custard tasted really fresh and a lot lighter than ice cream. but i give it 4 stars because of their limited selection. i wanted a butter pecan but the guy said he only had, vanilla, strawberry, choc, rocky road, and a couple others. i settled for the rocky road, but was dissapointed so i went back and ordered the luv it special (vanilla w/ pecans and moschino cherries) and that definitely did it for me!"
"If you are in Madison, and you still buy your music, then you need to go here. Though I don't recall seeing Tapes here, oh well they sell cool new albums on Vinyl, which is pretty damn awesome. Chances are there will be some CD or LP that will make you go DAAMMMMNN I want that! I always like to check it out at least once a year when I go up to Madison, if not just to gaze at all the stuff I wish I had money for. Or wish that I listened to music not off my laptop or iPod. Curse you connivence! You make me not listen to my CDs or LPs anymore! If I did, I would buy them here so they would stay in business because they are pretty cool."
"4 stars for 1/2 price sushi on Wednesdays and Thursdays! Nothing incredibly inventive here. Basic sushi and good hibachi, if you choose to sit at one of the cook-in-front-of-you tables. \n\nNot super accommodating of special sushi requests, but that could've just been the waitress. Overall the rolls were good for a great price. The sushi rice wasn't mushy (a huge pet peeve). And the service was efficient. \n\nDon't come here for ambience, but if you need a cheap sushi fix, this should do it."
"How anyone doesn't get the appeal of Ian's is beyond me. I'm with Kate - living 3000 miles away makes you want your college days back., specifically so you can hit up Ian's at 2a.  The mac & cheese pizza is amazingly good. Oh sweet Ian."
"I've had a meal or five at Mr. K's, and you definitely have to experience the place to believe it.  While Charlotte has a tendency to tear down anything more than a few years old, Mr. K's has managed to survive for decades.\n\nAlong with places like Price's and Zack's, they are perhaps the best place to find Charlotte's soul for food.  Nothing fancy, just  a good meal at a decent price.\n\nUnfortunately, Charlotte is much more interested in creating vacant lots and building new and better on top of whatever was there before.  You will find some good food being made here and there, but generally you end up with just another franchise being put up over and over again.\n\nMr. K's is definitely different: Family-owned and run.  You'll want to make sure that you pay attention to the hours, especially on the weekends.  Don't go on Saturday night expecting to get a treat for example - one mistake that I've made more than once!"
"Wow, talk about covering all your essential food groups: grease, oil, lard, and fat. Oh, I forgot the maple syrup: pure sugary goodness. I ate waffles.. fried chicken... salmon cakes... bacon... grits... It was a food coma done right. I have to disclose that the after-effects include: waist expansion, sleepiness, and an insatiable need to be still and slothlike. \n\nDespite the health risks of eating at Lo-Lo's, it's pure bliss: a symphonic orchestra of flavors that should be experienced on a regulated basis - try once every few months."
"""One of our staple places - just wish the wait wasn't so long on Friday nights.  \n\nService could be better - the staff is short-witted and have a \""""get the to point attitude - which is understandable given the popularity of this place.  \n\nI also wish they took reservations in the stable."""
"Halso has such a large jewelry collection, I would never consider shopping elsewhere for high-quality body jewelry. And yes, it is expensive, but it's the best you're going to be able to find.\n\nI had Jeremiah pierce my navel and he did everything possible to ease the tension (I'm rather afraid of needles.) He's an absolute riot and did a very good job.\n\nI've also had Ana help  me change my navel ring and cartilage ring many times, and Kelsey is wonderful at helping me pick out jewelry.\n\nI plan on returning if (when) I get my nose pierced."
"Why can't this chain take over Roberto's??? \nA big thumbs up. \nI got the junior burrito with beans, rice, carne asada, and pico de gallo. \nAhhhh all the great memories of going to the taco trucks in California flooded back. \n$3 bucks. That's a great deal. \nThe place may be fast food, but it's authentic. I wish they had more locations."
"*Biased Review* \nI know Thai food well. \n\n- Food: Very Authentic, good taste just like when I go to Thailand. Cant get better than that. Of course this is with some dishes, not everything or all the time. Depends on the chef probably. \n\n- Sanitation: Reminds me of Thailand as well...Dirty. Not American Standard. But they are downtown. But I go there for the food. I was street raised, so don't mind eating ghetto styles. \n\n- Atmosphere: Not really authentic, just a place, with tables, a TV and Chairs. What evs \n\n- Overall: When I visit, I make it my business to visit and get food. I take food home for my friends mom, who happens to know Thai flavors more than me, considering my friends Mother, Grand and Great Grandmother all once worked at the Royal Palace in Thailand as food preps. \n\nTrust, the food here is bomb if you are looking for full Thai Flavors."
"I've only been here once, but I had a good time. The food was nothing to write home about, but it has a great atmosphere. The fruity drinks aren't cheap, but they're also not ridiculous (6-10 bucks). I'd go back. \n\nOh, and one exception to the so-so food were the conch fritters. They were a little different than I've had before, with more crunch and spice. Awesome.\n\nDon't forget, this place does not accept credit or debit cards!  I guess there's an ATM, but, seriously, I don't want to have to go to the ATM."
"My daughter called to tell me her car will turn over but won't start at 4:30pm on a Friday. Problem, I live in Asheville she's going to college in Charlotte. Call AAA have the vehicle towed to this AAA service center. Then I see the reviews. I went into worry mode. I've managed auto part stores and have heard of horror stories. But I can't do anything being so far away, so I wait. Next morning I call them to hear the bad news, guess what Shane says the technicians started the car right up. Checked it out to make sure nothing else going on. He assumes that since the car was on an incline and had low gas that it wasn't getting enough fuel but everything was good. When I asked if I could give him payment over the phone, surprised again, he said not necessary that there was no charge. Thanks for letting a distant dad not have to worry."
"Sir Ed's always delivers.  I got there in the middle of trivia but I was able to get a spot at the bar.  I finally ordered the fish and chips and washed it down with a Port City Porter.  \n\nThe only thing really working against this place is how it's so hidden.  There are signs on the front side of the shopping center, but I didn't feel like navigating stairs and my friend was having problems finding me."
"Excellent view & service, somewhat 'dated' interior (still acceptable) - 4 stars \nAppetizer: jumbo shrimp cocktail(5), ahi tempura, crab cake - all pretty good, 4 stars\nEntr\u00e9e: hawaiian ahi tuna sesame style, Chilean sea bass, and another fish whose name I cannot recall. They were somehow all so salty. Wish they put less salt in it. 3 stars.\nGot chocolate cake for dessert-Okay.\nIt is a pricey place. 3 adults paid $300 for dinner including a bottle of wine."
"Very well taken care of fairways and greens just like i would expect from walters. I didn't encounter the bunkers except for 2....my problem was that thick savahna. You mishit your drive just a bit and you are on it. I enjoyed a course that isn't lined up with houses on both sides. I would describe this course as relatively difficult, a bit overpriced and a fun experience overall. I have never played any british open courses so i can't compare, but it was nice to have play something different. I do think they should provide water botttles with how much they are charging, but no biggie."
"Cheesesteak is delicious. This is a fat kid treat, so don't come here looking for something healthy on the menu; just enjoy the cheesesteak with wiz and go to the gym later. Your body will forgive you."
"I found this place on yelp during my stay in Vegas. My boyfriend and I were trying to kill time since our flight came in wayyy earlier than our hotel check in, so we came here to have lunch. \n\nIt was easy to find but the parking lot is soo small and crowded, so be careful driving around in there. The restaurant itself is small and can get very crowded during lunch hours. Luckily for us, we got here when it wasn't too busy but got extremely busy when we left. They serve Korean and popular Hawaiian dishes which made it extremely hard for an indecisive person to pick. I settled with the salmon teriyaki which was really good. Generous portions and decently priced.  The owner was EXTREMELY nice and made his way around checking up on us occasionally and even joking with us."
"""This is exactly how it's described.  It's huge.  It's awesome.  He's got things no one else can even think to have.  But make sure you look at all the discs. Don't take his word for it! I always inspect but caught up in it and took his word for a \""""clean\"""" copy.  Not so much.   The price is right, tho, to try lots of new things."""
"Yeah this back yard style smoked meat BBQ is consistently the best.  Knowing that John Mull is a butcher adds to the fact that he knows his Q.  Nicely smoked meats, tender fall off the bone ribs in generous portions, great side items.  Do not miss the peach cobbler, it will make you cry.  Sure you have to take it away, or eat outside on a bench.  Who cares, we dont need no stinking table service!  Be aware that you have to stand in a line outside, so bring your chill attitude, it can take 20 minutes or more on a weekend.  Oh and did I mention they have free beer Saturdays while you are waiting?"
I love that Ronald's Donuts exists!!! Thank (insert deity here) they don't have one in LA or I'd be headed to Jenny Craig.
"4 stars for Pittsburgh.  This was our pizza standby for years.  Good enough that even the plain is good. \n\nEating in is sometimes unpleasant, what with the TV blaring, etc.  And the staff only warmed up to us after 4 years.  Spinach and onion calzone is pretty damn good, probably better than the pizza."
"Great neighborhood place with a wide variety of delicious food. Service was a tad slow as the staff seem stretched too thin but not bad enough to deter me from recommending it or returning. \n\nI had the Macho Nacho, you can order a half order which is a more appropriate size portion, which was delicious.  They are happy to give you complimentary plastic cups of drink to go, even just water. That was a nice touch.\n\nOutdoor and indoor seating.  Free beverages while you wait and tables seen to turn quickly. \n\nA great place to catchup with friends, relax, and eat a great variety if breakfast food."
There prolly is some really fancy awesome nail salon somewhere in summerlin that does a phenomenal job and is way better than my ghetto little nail place BUT you can guarantee they will charge you an arm and a leg to do that. I like this little salon. Maybe they don't do the best of the best but they are good enough for me and my pocket. I am simple so a lil gel manicure with French tips and same for my pedi and a wax for my eyebrows and I'm out the door within two hours :) feeling like a princess :)
"The market forces them to have less bonchon selection, but grateful they are here.\n\n(Dolsot bibimbap - pictured)"
"I went here a year ago and still remember how good the food was.  Unfortunately it's fairly expensive, but worth it."
Man these sure are some good burrito's amigo's. Wish there was one next door but then I would gain thousands of pounds. LOL
"I'm not sure why anyone would bother eating in this place, when they clearly have the most awesome bar and bartender in the universe.  The 90+ martini menu is unbelievable, and everybody is really friendly.  The only downside is that it's so far out of downtown, but really, it prevents it from being overrun by DBs and...well, more DBs.\n\nMartini Bob is fantastic, the drinks are super-strong, and the atmosphere is a thousand times awesome. I haven't eaten here, and I don't plan on it; I just want to drink at the bar and watch the parade."
Always fabulous coffee!! Most of the time I am forced to take it to go because there is not a lot of seating
"THAT ICE CREAM WAS SO GOOODDDDD!! The only reason I am giving it a 4/5 stars is because I think it's too sweet as you get to the bottom and then the M&M becomes WAY too sweet. However, I could eat the waffle cone all day. I got the birthday cake which is absolutely amazing. It really is a Pittsburgh gem."
"Decided to take the path less traveled and wound up at this joint.  (This is a good location if you're heading to the outlet mall!)  We were tired of all the upscale restaurants and overpriced grub on the strip.  Had the sampler which was $10 for 2 eggs, hash browns, 2 sausages, 2 bacon strips, 2 ham pieces and your choice of pancakes or french toast.  What a great deal!  Of course, how 'good' can you make the average eggs, bacon, sausage and ham?  They were average but the sausage was good!  I dont even like breakfast sausage and I ate these!  Had the french toast, WOW!  It was so tasty!!!!  My sister had ordered the cheese blintzes, and you could hear the clash from our forks fighting for the last pieces!  The decor is dated, but as long as it kept prices down it was all good on my end!  Service was excellent and my coffee cup was never empty!  Cannot wait to come back to sin city and have breakfast here again!"
It's your standard Panda Express. This one is at least busy most of the time so the entrees seem to always be fresh and haven't been sitting in the warming tray for hours. The staff always seems to be friendly and the place is clean.
"""One of the best places where one can enjoy brunch in Pittsburgh!\n\nTo be honest, I'm not a big fan of brunch, mostly because I'm a guy and would like spend more time doing real fun stuff. But Zenith has never brought me this kind of feeling since going to Zenith is something FUN.\n\nNo need to say to much about their food. Just wonderful.\n\nThe real interesting things are their decorations as well as all kinds of antiques that fill up the entire place. \n\nA \""""must-go\"""" in Pittsburgh!!"""
Always wonderful.  Great food and good service.  It's a shame that the patio is in a parking lot but that is my only compliant.
"After the reviews I read, my family and I (5 total) decided to stay here for a one-nighter on our way to southern CA.  Overall I was expecting to give this hotel 5 stars but come to find out that it is really only a 4 star place.  I know, it's not the Wynn, Venetian, etc so I believe my expectations are realistic.  Overall, it's a Holiday Inn Express.  The staff was OK, the shuttle bus to the Strip was convenient, the rooms were clean and the bathrooms in pretty good shape.  The breakfast in the morning was just OK, nothing to really rant and rave about but again, it's a Holiday Inn Express.  The location was convenient so overall it's an above average place in my book but nothing out of the ordinary either."
"Honest.... They had to clean up what another company didn't... (YES plumbing)  my AC was blowing hot air.... I was quoted thousands....feeling uneasy about the line of BS I was given, I asked my social media friends to post their recommendation for an. Honest AC company... It was almost unanimous... DEKES... HONEST....they debunked claims from the NO man... Fixed my breaker and not a problem ever again..."
"I actually really like this store. They have a great selection of cheap, fun jewelry(if you're willing to dig through the jam packed displays--which I am, when I'm looking for a deal). Most of the time I can find cute earrings and necklaces for $4-8. Everything else can be hit and miss, though. I've gone in and found cute purses, clothes and shoes...and other times it seems like everything is either outdated, or WAY too wannabee trendy. I find this to be the case at similar stores like Marshall's and TJ Maxx, too. \n\nBottom line: stop in if you're in the area and have some time to dig through the racks...but don't expect to always find a diamond in the rough."
"""Small, family owned store located in the corner of a shopping center, near Pho Saigon 8 and BBQ King. The popular Dakao for viet sandwiches is next door as well.\n\nThis place may be small but they provide quite the amount of stuff. From a variety of fresh farm-raised non-caged chickens to a easy-to-cook soy bean curd to fresh vegetables. \n\nTheir veggies may seem a little higher priced, but if they have in stock, it will probably be the best you can buy. Each bag is handpicked and bagged nicely so you have a smaller chance in running into \""""bad pieces\"""" in your veggies. \n\nThey do have a minimum on accepting credit cards tho. Believe it was either $5 or $10 min =X be careful ! (personal experience of almost not having enough cash to buy)"""
"I LOVE this place! This is the best Pizza in Pittsburgh, hands-down. \n\nXL Mushrooms, Anchovies & Black Olives! \n\nMy only complaint is that they don't deliver to Brighton Heights. Why did I move??"
"When I was a college type in Madison, I ate here every_day. I'm not lying. At the very least I would get the Thai fried rice. It was an expensive but fulfilling activity. \n\nThe Singapore noodles and curry squash are second to none and I have eaten at many a Thai restaurant.  We have made the drive just for the food several times."
"I'm not from Louisiana.  That being said, I love this place.  The food is always great!  The fried pickles are AMAZING.  The fried green beans are a close second.  Fried cat fish is the best I have EVER had.  All fish dishes I have ordered have been cooked and seasoned perfectly.  For dessert, if you have room, the peach bread pudding with rum sauce makes my taste buds scream with joy!  :D\nCaution:  If you are on a diet, avoid this place.  There are a couple of grilled dishes but most dishes are either fried, buttered and/or smothered in deliciousness.  YUM!"
"""I don't really go for ice cream but when a friend from the Midwest said I needed to try this full of fat, creamy treat, how could I say no.  \n\nSo now, after having it four times in the past two months, I'm hooked.\n\nI'm biased since I never had frozen custard in my life. It really was rich.  Very different flavor from what I expected.  Tried multiple \""""specials\"""".  Hey, they are all good 2000 calorie treats.  Well worth the wait to order.\n\nThe location is not that great (borders a strip club - to be reviewed later) and a convenece store that seems to be drug dealer's central.\n\nOther than that, this place is worth a try."""
"This place is certainly no five star restaurant, and it doesn't try to be. It is incredably good homecooking that everyone's grandma used to make. That in its self is very sellable to a broad range of folks, count me in as one of them. Scatch this off as a solid 4.5\n\nService is eh... pretty much that of a diner. Nothing insanelyly spectacularr food came out hot and fast and let me ell you their soup hit the spit. It was a hearty broth- based white bean and porktastic offering. A cup of that and a couple o bites of that collars dip and i was good to go. Note to dish: y'all need bacon in your green beans"
"I really enjoyed a celebratory dinner I recently had at at Timpone's.  I'd always meant to try it out but never had.  The food was really good, the service was excellent and it had a nice cozy romantic feel.  It was, however, pretty expensive, particularly for being located on a college campus.  The food was fantastic but portions were on the small side, especially considering the prices.  The peach bread pudding was scrumptious.  I probably won't be back, not because it wasn't good, but because there are a lot of other upscale places in town I'd like to try before I break the bank at Timpone's again, and special occasions that warrant a $100 tab only come along so often."
"While in college every time my in-laws would come into town they would take us here. I've only been in for brunch and lunch, but I've never had anything bad. The eggs benedict is stellar. There is also an omelet with crab, asparagus and hollandaise that will blow your mind."
"""Notwithstanding a previous review, I do go to \""""10\"""" here...but my taste buds are probably a bit numbed by cigars. Pin-Kaow is a much better than average Thai venue -- the food's great at both lunch and dinner...best of all, it's reasonable."""
"Had the beef pho. I forget if it was the number 11 or 12. It was very good. Some places have a cilantro overkill, but this place did it just right."
"Tony was very honest, and reasonable! Brought him in to put in a celing fan, and fix a pool light. He quoted me much less than the other guys did, and came to do the work within one business day. Very professional. I would recommend All Valley to anyone!"
"""What I affectionately call \""""Ghetto Chinese Food\"""" or \""""Chinese Soul Food\"""" if you prefer. \n\nHere are the essential characteristics of Ghetto Chinese Food, in my opinion: \ncheap; decent (not good or bad) cuts of meat; huge portions; a tad greasy but not so much; questionable neighborhood; suspicious looking customers; served out of a hole in the wall; and lots of chicken wings on the menu (i.e. fried, buffalo, jalapeno, garlic or BBQ).   This place has it all; that is why I give Liyuen five stars, because as far as Ghetto Chinese Food goes, this place is as good as it gets!\n\nI have had the egg foo young, several chicken dishes, the egg rolls, shrimp fried rice and the chicken wings. I've enjoyed it all.  I will  be back, especially when I want to eat a ton of food for six bucks.  If you like this place try Tam's."""
This place is always packed. They usually have 20% off coupons that they give you at the door. Customer service is good.
Marc Simon immediately grasped a very complicated situation and ran with it. He was easy to talk to and provided practical advice above and beyond the legal issues.
Will and John helped us out when our camper van broke down in Vegas.  They set us up with a good price on a minivan and when we found out we'd have to drive back to San Diego they switched us into a different minivan that we could take to SD without any waiting.  I'm really pleased with the level of service we received from this enterprise location. They went out of their way to be friendly and helpful.
The monday menu isn't the greatest.. But every other day is AWESOME.. very unqiue prime rib.
"There is a nominal fee now. I believe it's $6 per person. Check the days they are open before you set out. We went on a closed day during the week. Darn it. If this happens to you, head over the Nature Museum instead. It's right around the corner."
"Lots of food, price was fair. Very busy place."
"Even if you are trying NOT to like the co-op(like some other Yelpers) it's impossible not to appreciate this place!\n\nLovely produce, great bulk section, bountiful organics, and a deli that can kick any grocer's arse.\n\nIt's really worth it to get a membership(which I think is reasonably priced), if you are going to shop there more than a few times a year,"
"During a terrible time I was so grateful for this hospital. They were open late, compassionate, patient, and reasonably priced. Dr. Burke and the staff treated my cat with respect and kindness while being honest with her prognosis and providing alternative options."
Went there for breakfast today and found out they are closing at 4pm today. They had great food and microbrews. I have been going here since they opened. I'll miss this place. I've never had a bad meal here.
"Recently went here for a physical and I was a first time patient with Dr. Greene (Ralph).  That being said, obviously I didn't know what to expect.  I was pleasantly greeted and brought back for my physical quicker than I could have imagined and have ever been.  I didn't even have time to fill out my medical history if that tells you anything.  Normally wait times for doctor offices are minimally 15 minutes in my experience.  \n\nThe staff was very friendly and Dr. Greene was no exception.  He was fantatstic and answered any and all questions that I might have had.  Besides the doctor, the x-ray technician, the phlebotomist, etc. were all great and very professional.\n\nI think I've found a good doctor and facility here :)"
"best sandwich in the nation!  capastrami is a must try!  although, i heard the bobbie is a favorite but it wasn't for me...maybe cause it was cold?  and i'm a warm/hot sandwich kind of person...bonus, throw some chips in and make it all better."
"I'm told they are expensive and there are other places that are better, but both times I've been there, I got great deals and left very happy.  No complaints.  I'll return there first when I need something else.  Look for the deals...they are there!"
The Bonanza is an interesting place to shop at.  There is some nice stuff and some overpriced stuff.  I haven't been there in a while so I don't remember much.  All I remember is that it is huge and has a lot of turquoise jewelry and a lot of Southwestern-type stuff.
"I love Mad Cat. I just visited last week when I was having some issues with a new cat getting along with my old cat and the employee there was super helpful and they are definitely getting into fights a lot less now. \nThey give great advice and they have tons of different options for cat toys, treats, litter, foods, etc. \nGoing to swing by there soon to check out cat trees!\nHighly recommended."
"Went for my sis in-law's bachy, our experience was funny.\n\nAll the dudes are gay and short. They do this thing where they smack you in the face with their stick. The men strippers were pathetic; we didn't pay for a dance. \n\nThe woman dancers were not very breathtaking, except for one.. The Cuban or Columbian chic we paid to dance on my sis in law. \n\nTitti's & ass is all the same yo."
"Village Pub is a great place with excellent service!\n\nWe live right down the street, yet always manage to 'forget' this location and wind up going somewhere else.  Then, after horrible service at other locations we end up back here.  \n\nWe were visiting just this past Monday with Michael the bartender and his service is excellent!  We never ran low on our drinks, managed to have great conversation as the music wasn't too loud, and there were no loud-mouth drunken fools like most of the other pubs around.  \n\nWe have yet to eat in the dining area, yet everyone I speak to says the food is excellent with good pricing.  \n\nThanks Village Pub, and Michael in particular!\n\nKris Kelley\n702.203.5670\nLas Vegas Massage"
"The Triple Decker with pastrami is pretty much my favorite thing ever. Even if the service and atmosphere were awful, which it's not, I would still totally come here for this sandwich. In fact I'm surprised crack dealers aren't selling this sandwich on the corner, because it's so good that I would buy it from them. I have visited some of New York's most famous deli's and so far have found nothing that even comes close."
"""I have been a member of the Phoenix Art Museum for five years.  I stop in for ten minutes sometimes, just to go in and take a friend to \""""the light room!\""""  If you don't know what I am talking about, THEN YOU NEED TO VISIT THE PHOENIX ART MUSEUM.  Seriously, a smaller version of the exhibit went on display in NYC, and there were lines around the block.  We, in Phoenix, have it here ALL the time, it is a permanent exhibit.\n\nAnyway, the museum is the largest art museum in the Southwest, the facility is gorgeous, and the staff very helpful and nice.  I find the changing exhibits to be mostly good.  They went all out recently with the hollywood exhibit.  I went twice, and loved it, but I am a big movie guy.\n\nThe restaurant has a full bar, which makes for a nice sunday with a bloody mary brunch and art exhibit!\n\nIf you are on a budget, I am pretty sure the museum is open for free on first Friday's!!!\n\nEnjoy,\nD"""
"This is the greatest tire company.  Not only are their tires reasonably priced, they are exceptional in their service to their customers.They go over and beyond to please their customers.  This is even if you are out of state.  They don't care.  Service is the same without any problems.  Recently, I was in Las Vegas.  I had a tire pressure problem.  Russell took care of the problem in a few minutes and I was on my way back to \ncalifornia.  I wouldn't buy from anyone else.  Also, the office is spotlessly clean."
"Used to come here years ago with my mom & her ex boyfriend & they've been broke up since '99....so that's how long ago...anyway, my boyfriend wanted us to try something new & since I hasn't been here in THAT ^^^ long we chose here. The service was good, it was quiet & not very busy. We had our daughter & ordered something quick for her & asked our server to bring it to us as soon as it was ready, which she did. Our food was good, I has a steak with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms & baked potato. Both were good! My boyfriend got a porterhouse which was good but wished he'd gotten the same steak as me. Well, we've been back a couple more times since & he's had it! Definitely would recommend Billy Bobs!"
"We used Presidential Limos for 4 trips while in Vegas. They were always on time, very courteous and professional and the cars were very clean and well stocked.  Would totally use them again and recommend them. For comparison, we did use one other limo service while we were there (because we wanted a certain glamourous huge party limo) and the service definitely was not as good as Presidential."
"Definitely some of the fastest served food in the area. I always enjoy their fajitas, queso and margaritas. While not the most exceptional mexican food I've ever had, its always consistently good. One of the things I think they could improve on, is specifically with their chicken in the fajitas. I almost feel as though the meat wasn't cooked fresh on the spot, but earlier in the day for quick service. While thats great for turnaround and getting food out, it leaves the chicken feeling dry and not as fresh as it could be. If they are looking to push their quality they could really look into a different way of preparing their foods. Overall though I really like coming here and will continue to."
"This isn't the Petco I frequent but one day we were in the area and I did not want to forget the kittytap food and found Solid Gold, Before Grain and Merricks cans to please him. And a few chew bones for the doggers. \n\nCheck out the clearance bins, sometimes you find some crazy deals there specially on harnesses and leashes. I got a $5off coupon on my receipt this visit for any cat food kibble so bonus.\n\nThe staff at this location is pretty nice, even when we observed one customer be uber rude to the girl helping us."
"This is a nice gas station and very convenient.  In fact all the PDQs are pretty well run, well lit, well organized, efficient and competatively priced.   They have some pretty good sandwiches and salads if you need something quick in the morning to have with you for lunch.   The price is about 4 bucks on average per item.   They used to have Neuman's Own dressing packets for free but last I was in there it was Kraft.   Please bring back the Neuman's Own.\nOne tip, at this store there are freeloaders that hang out in the morning.  They will hit you up for cash, gas and sometimes for food.   I no longer get my gas in the early morning hours as a result.  Same goes for all the stations on Fish Hatch as far as when to get your gas."
"There is plenty of help in the restaurant and they seem to stay quite busy. I haven't been to any of the other two locations, but I'm pretty satisfied with what I've seen from this one.\n\nThey deliver, which is a plus, if you're in the area and willing to pay a couple extra dollars. It's a nice change from what you're accustomed to having delivered (Pizza, Chinese, etc.)\n\nThe food here is pretty good, but I don't think it's GREAT. I've had better Thai food around town. Regardless, this is a good food option if it's convenient."
"These guys are the best. My AC pump went out. I purchased a new one from Auto Zone brought my truck and part in on a moments notice. They replaced the parts, charged the system and it works like new for half the price others wanted.  Great service, fast and professional"
"My first meal in Squirrel Hill while looking for an apartment (I'm moving from out of town) was at Napoli Pizzeria.  When I walked in there were several EMTs by the door, so I figured the food would be good.  What EMT would go to a bad pizza place?  \n\nAt the entrance to the left is the counter with some of the pies waiting to be heated back up in the oven and to the right several coolers with drinks in bottles from beer to soda.  I ordered two slices of pepperoni, which came out pretty quickly.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and the pizza had just about the right ratio of crust to cheese to sauce.  It was greasy, but not too greasy (read just the way I like it).  On a cold day, it was the perfect hot thing for lunch and wasn't too pricey either."
"The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, although our table for 2 was a little small. Our waiter was fantastic. I had a spinach salad with warm chorizo dressing that was phenomenal, the little goat cheese crouton on the side was a nice compliment. My husband really liked his french onion soup (they now use their own veal stock from what the waiter told us) that is all fresh ingredients. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that my husband's turkey panini came with tomatoes, and it doesn't say that on the menu. He HATES tomatoes with a passion. My apple crumble was pretty good, I could tell it was fresh apples and not from a can, but not the best I've ever had."
"I have been going to Homer's for many years and feel compelled to write a review... which I don't normally do!  They are FAIR and HONEST, which, unfortunately, is not always the case elsewhere. They are very accommodating and I've seen them take people who just drive in with a car problem, although I usually call ahead and make an appointment. Mr. Homer, JR, and the guys all treat people well and I like that I'm supporting a local, family-owned business. I don't care what the waiting area looks like! ( former reviewer...) I want RELIABLE, cost efficient service. That's what I get at Homer's and that's why I send people I care about there."
"I meet clients for lunch.  I don't live in most of the places I do this in, and because I have an expense account, I usually don't care too much about the price for lunch.  I'm there to talk up my product, so the food, ambience, wait staff etc, should be good, and yet invisible.\n\nI depend on Yelpers to keep me in the know when it comes to restaurants.  This place was as advertised.  Good food, good wine selection (although we didn't drink at lunch).  \n\nThe vodka sauced dish was good and my client's steak salad was too.  We has some kind of puff pastry that was really good, though I had to nearly beg to get them to cut it in half for my client and I so two grown men in suits weren't carving it up at the table.\n\nAll in all a very nice spot waaaay off the strip."
"I dont care what anyone says, this is by far the best Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food ever. I have not been able to find anything to compare. I wish I still lived in Pgh!"
"Good coffee for a very reasonable price. Clean little establishment with generous employees. Drink local! Havn't had their food, so that docks them a star, but that might change soon!"
"Clean, affordable, friendly technicians--I am picky when it comes to manicures and pedicures but I go here frequently.  The only drawbacks?  They don't carry too many Essie colors and there's usually a wait (even if you've made an appointment)."
"Super great atmosphere, has the NFL package, great drink prices... If only it wasn't absolutely filled with cigarette smoke inside."
"If it's Friday, it's time for LoLo's"
"Farm Basket is one of those nostalgic treats I allow myself from time to time, but not too regularly.  The reason?  It's SO greasy.  And more than that, the grease is GOOD.  I don't know what they do to it or if I've just become acclimated to it over the years, but an order of fries from this place sends my taste buds tappin' but the rest of my gastrointestinal system into severe distress.  But man are they ever good.\n\nThe Gobbler is awesome.  A breaded turkey sandwich with Miracle Whip (hey, that's what they give you) and cranberry spread, it's just darn delicious.  The Clucketos are classics, and if you find yourself dipping into the Colonel's bucket too often, you should try some of their fried chicken on for size.  It'll win you over.\n\nPlus, you get to drive through a barn.  That rules."
"I'm being a little generous with the rating. It's more of a 3.5 to 3.75 star rating. I rounded up :P.\n\nThe food and drink here is consistently decent. The slushes are just the right amount of sweet for me. The boba is nice and chewy with just a little hint of sweetness. I've had the mango shaved ice and green bean shaved ice as well. Both of which were really tasty.\n\nThe aspect they're really docked down on for me is the service. The workers are really inattentive to their customers when you're sitting down at a table. They don't check up on you, and sometimes you have to flag them down just to put in your order. If you're just ordering to go, they can be pretty speedy even when they're busy. But if you're sitting down, don't come in expecting they're going to be catering to you.\n\nOh, and the parking situation is pretty cramped. If you know you're going during peak times, you should park in the next lot over where the 99 Ranch Market is and walk over."
"""\""""EAT MO BETTAH!' \n\nI sure did!\n\nWalk into this small building, order your food from a super chill lay back guy and minutes later you feel like you in New Orleans. The commercial for Zatarain's was playing in my mind the whole time I was eating. But so much better then the box stuff.\n\nWould recommend the Mardi Gras Combo (red bean&rive, jambalaya & shrimp creole) because most of the time I can't make up my mind. Now the Shrimp \u00c9touff\u00e9e is said to be very, very hot. So I got a half order to play it safe. For me I've had spicier food elsewhere. Don't get me wrong it's hot put not with 2 verys. I was kinda let down by this cause I LOVE spicy food. Hotter the better."""
"If you are in a hurry and have little time to enjoy the dining experience, don't go here.  If you want some excellent Greek food in a Mom and Pop type restaurant, this is the place!"
Love Lo-Lo's! The chicken and waffle combo is delicious. The mac and cheese is just average to me- nothing extraordinary about it and not worth $4. I like the kool-aid and the sweet tea- both very sweet and cavity inducing. The waffles have an awesome buttery taste and the chicken is perfectly fried. Took off a star because parking is horrible and there is always a long wait to be seated.
The best!!! Unfortunately I found out about this place a month before I moved back to ca.. but every time I'm back I stop :) bear claw is besssst
"Today was a cold Wisconsin Sunday, and I decided I needed noodles and broth. We decided to try out Wah Kee, since neither of us had been there before.\n\nWow, this place has been here for 25 years. How had we not been here before? \n\nWe started off with a couple appetizers: the spring rolls, which were tasty, but I generally don't care for fried spring rolls, the kim chee, which was spicy and good, and the pork bun, which was huge. My husband's more of a pork bun aficionado than I, and he seemed to like it.\n\nFor our entrees, I got the Ginger, Scallion and Wonton Noodle Tong Mein, and it was just what I wanted: clean-tasting, ginger-spicy, with several good-sized shrimp and pork wontons. My husband got the Szechuan Dam Dam Noodles, which were spicy, but looked a little greasy to me. He seemed to like it, though. We both left thoroughly stuffed.\n\nOh, and I also fell desperately in love with guava juice. We will be back, for sure!"
I have been a client of IPH for about four years now. Dr Watson was my Busters Vet. She is so  deadicatied to her patients and her profession . Buster recently passed and it was very heartrenching as you can imanige. When I brought Buster to the hospital to be cremated the girls met me in the parking lot with a gurney and a blanket. They took charge with care and dignity which made me feel a little better. \nI just recieved a card in the mail today which made me cry and I will cherish. All the staff signed and wrote words of comfort which it was. Dr Watson wrote me a personal note which made me feel good having wondered did I do everything I could and her words assured me that I did. I just rescued a a pup and  from the rescue center and I know he will be in good hands with Dr Watson and the staff at IPH.
"IAC has become one of our favorite restaurants to go to. As a local, you never wanna go to the Strip and pay Strip-price for something that tastes like Olive Garden, sorry, Olive Garden fans. \n\nWe have returned about half a dozen times since my first review and have brought friends and family; we have absolutely enjoyed every single times we have been. The food has always hit the spot and we haven't ran into anymore salty penne or bread-less entrees since. \n\nAgain, if you're looking for good Italian food in an old school Las Vegas setting, you need to come to the IAC."
"The absolute best fried chicken I've ever had. The waffles and syrup are heaven on a plate, with a hint of cinnamon.\n\nLo-Lo's is a required stop after an overnight visit to Phoenix. My fiance and I wake up, check out of our hotel in a hurry, ignoring any and all continental breakfasts that stand in our way. We never remember where Lo-Lo's is exactly, except that it's on some side street, but fortunately GPS has never let us down.\n\nLo-Lo's makes a point of hanging signs that indicate that service is slow, but I've never had a bad experience there.\n\nMmm mmm mmm!"
"Tasty! I enjoy the Americano Burrito and cheese enchiladas. I didn't like the Burro that much, but that's my personal preference and I probably wouldn't like it anywhere. It's 24 hours, it's got a drive-thru. It is very convenient. It never seems to take very long to get my food. The location is good, too, like if you needed to pick up some things from Safeway and then swing through the drive-thru, it's very easy and convenient. Their salsas are very good and remind me of New Mexico chile. They add a 50 cent charge to use cards, so if you have cash and want to save a little going there, that's the way to go, but it's relatively inexpensive anyway."
"Had a fantastic dinner there. The meatball appetizer was amazingly flavorful and the San Marzano tomato sauce to top it off was the perfect compliment. The main course eggplant dish was served hot and was spiced perfectly. It was enough to split between the two of us. \nIt was our second visit. Loved it both times. BYOB can't be beat. My ONLY downside to the place is the ventilation. It doesn't exist. Be prepared that whatever you wear to the restaurant, you will be smelling on your clothes until they are laundered. In spite of all that.......a must go !"
"While in phoenix, I felt that I had to try mexican food.  I found myself downtown without a car, so was entirely yelp dependent.  \n\nI walked into mi patio and although the ambience had me worried as it seemed like a cheesy american mexican place.\n\nThey quickly brought me fresh chips and a nice spicy salsa--definitely a good start.  I had trouble deciding on what to order, so I ordered the veggie combo which combined a # of things off the menu.  Although it was on the greasy side, the food was fresh and all very tasty.  I added some hot sauce to some of the dishes as they were a bit on the mild side.  \n\nNot the best mexican I have had, but would definitely go back if in the mood for some greasy mexican food."
"We went to Mirabelle this morning to pick up a couple small cakes for my birthday dessert. The line was out the door, which should not be a surprise on a Saturday morning--especially in farmer's market season when downtown Urbana is at its busiest. It didn't take too long, though--only about ten minutes--to reach the head of the line. The three young women behind the counter were cheerful and helpful despite the crowd; brief but polite. Mirabelle specializes in fresh-baked breads and pastries, and the place was chock-full of delicious-looking goodies. We came for two small pieces of cake but it took a great deal of willpower not to come home with a bagful of other treats. We decided on the chocolate and lemon, one piece each. We split them after dinner, and man were they good. I can't say for sure which I liked better, but I am leaning toward the lemon--a nice balance of sweet and tart. Both were yummy, and we will definitely be back, next time to check out the baguettes."
Had multiple problems with my car and came here for advice and tips; reasonable pricing and great help. Especially from Daniel who is very knowledgable and does not mind you picking his brain. Go to Dan! Dan's the man!
"Honestly, I do not understand how Einsteins or any other bagel place is even in business when Bagels Forever is an option. I have to say, this is the only place I have been coming to since I was 3 years old (20 years ago) and it is just as awesome and amazing now as it was then.  The best bagels you will ever eat, period. I have yet to find one as good, or even to come close.  And in the last 20 years they have added lovely things, like yummy sandwiches made fresh, coffee that is locally made, and hours that allow you to enjoy your bagels morning, noon and night:) All that and the bagels have only gone up 20 cents in 20 years!  Seriously, drop whatever you're doing and go.  You will be doing yourself the biggest favor."
"sorry to say you lose a star and a half luv-it and i spoke so highly of you and your frozen gold,well i was so dissapointed last night i had the mint chip custard  i have been wanting since we found this place and it was all melty i made a mess allover the car with the melted custard that they served me. they must have had there tempature on the freezer wrong or something... so disapointing.."
"So good for a sushi craving. The place is dated and not the cleanest to sit in, but it's worth it for the sushi."
"The food and service were great. I had the Omelette with cheese and turkey sausage, my daughter had the red velvet pancakes. Fresh squeezed OJ was very tasty. \n\nThe  four stars are for the service and food. They need to be more attentive to details with cleanliness and decor. Several light bulbs were burnt out, dust on the walls and lights. I would like to see them deep clean this place. Lack of attention to detail with cleanliness always concerns me, because if they don't clean the place where customers sit and see, how does the kitchen look?"
"I bought a used 02 Miata and after extensive research found Mike to be the only one to take a Miata too in Phoenix. I took the car to him and had his guys look it over and WOW! Treated my car like it was his own and shared a TON of useful information on how to care for it. Sorry your closing soon, I would have been a life long customer!"
"Not for everyone but a second home to me. Love that doctors, lawyers, rockabillys, hipsters, douchebags, and homeless folks can co-exist peacefully and sing bad, but really fun karaoke. What more can you ask for?"
"Went in here at 5:30p and there was no line - by the time we left, there was at least a 45 minute wait by 7p.  The food is good, a little to processed, but for people that eat this type of food all the time probably think it is A-ok.  A nice treat going here, but I would not go all the time.  The bread and butter is delicious.  The filet was ok - a little overcooked for me even when I requested medium rare.  The kid got mac and cheese and she liked it...good place for kids.\n\nNOTE - 3 stars for food & 4 stars for atmosphere - but atmosphere wins out here (especially when the waitresses do their line dance)"
Overall the place is pretty good.  Omelets are huge and the food is good.  Service is usually spot on.  It has a bright and friendly atmosphere.  Not sure what these other yelpers are talking about.  Bacon was salty?  Isn't bacon suppose to be naturally salty?
"I have been a few times now and always leave happy. The duck confit hash was great. The steel cut oats were great. The tuna melt is the best I've ever had. And one time I had a burger that was delicious. \n\nHowever, they get a few things wrong. I haven't had everything on the menu so I can't speak to everything but I have had a few things I didn't like. Their soups, for instance, don't always come out tasting as great as they sound. I have had one that was incredibly salty, and another that was just bland. Also, all of their sandwiches come with a red cabbage salad which should be delicious. But, instead it comes out tasting like a sour mess filled with what I think are fennel seeds, maybe anise. And to upgrade to a classy green salad smothered with balsamic costs another 1.50...who the hell upcharges for greens?\n\nAll in all their food is great and I feel safe ordering anything on the menu, except for soups. Also, next time I will just ask for nothing on the side as the mound of red cabbage always tempts...but also always disappoints."
"A treasure on Spring Mt. Thought the teas are a bit pricey, it is STILL just a couple more dollars. I am a big fan of tea. Definitely recommend rose tea with milk. If you get it with boba, suck with caution. Those things are dangerous."
"Karaoke at Yesteryears is a Charlotte institution. The crowd can be thin at times, but when it's on, it's awesome. Plus, you'll never meet a stranger when you're their. It's a shame they'll be closing."
"It's like everyone here is ecstatic to see that you are gonna get sloshed 3 hours after making a purchase from them.\n\nHonestly, they have a great selection and have my favorite beer and great prices.  The staff pretty much knows what they are talking about when it comes to alcohol.  And I haven't had a single homeless person come ask for money outside in their parking lot.\n\nI have no reason NOT to get this place.\n\nConditions For Me To Return:\n- If I live nearby and want alcohol\nor\n- Have $2 for me to grab a 4-Loko\n- In the mood to drink Bailey's from a shoe"
"I would never confuse good Asian, Thai, Chinese, Korean or Japanese food with Noodles...but if you're hungry and looking for something filling and delicious, this will fill the bill.  Yes, its a chain, yes, there are better choices, but for the money, Noodles will fill you up and put a smile on...well, it will fill you up."
"Great pizza but DON'T order online! What a mess! They didn't have my order, charged me twice, very frustrating. They did refund one of the charges and comped me a 2 liter soda. But do yourself a favor and just call it in. :)"
"Though I've not been there for the later crowd, even when it was only moderately full of people and no one on the dance floor yet, it was still a good time.  The lighting and thematic decor are unique and don't feel plastic or make it seem like a manufactured theme place.  The music they played was good, the drink specials were decent, and where else can you go and sit in a pit without that being a bad thing?  Overall, you will have  decent night there."
"These guys are the best! I came in with a dead battery, they realized my urgency (was on lunch beak and needed to get back to the office) and they had my truck done in 15 minutes. AND they gave me a discount since I work around the corner. Go out of your way to use this Firestone store!"
"Came here looking for meat and nothing but.  Ended leaving with 3 bags of really fresh vegetables, 5- 1 inch thick porterhouse, 2 flank steaks and 3 Delmonico cutes.\n\nTo start off, the vegetables were beautiful and fresh.  I picked up some bell peppers, poblano peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and asparagus.  All thrown into a hobo pack which turned out to be one of my top 10.\n\nThe meat was the star.  They had a decent selection.  Its not nearly as diverse as Pino's in NYC.  I wanted to get a solid necktie but they were out of skirt.  This is my one main point of contention with this place.  Its Friday afternoon, have the #1 griller available.  To compensate I took home the flank.  Good, but no skirt.  I went with the porterhouse too as its a crowd pleaser without breaking the bank.  The steaks were thick, juicy and perfect for the bbq.  \n\nMcGinnis Sisters did have a fine looking poultry and fish section, along with pork and lamb, but I was dead set on the beef.  Good job, McGinnis."
"I visited the Diamond with several friends on President's Day. Needless to say, there was a long wait due to lots of people off work plus everyone wanting to see the new look. But it was worth the wait. We started off with some fried pickles and onion rings. The fp's were fantastic, while the onion rings were just so-so. They were very thick cut, and the breading was not great. For the meal, I had a Plaza pimento cheese, which was fantastic. The fries (regular, not crinkle cut) were also wonderful. Two friends ordered small block burgers are were very satisfied. I will be returning soon, as you can't beat the Diamond for great greasy food in a cool atmosphere for a low price."
"This is a great little Pizza Hut. I have been here several times for carry-out and have received good service.\n\nOne odd-ball experience that I had here awhile back was when the place was robbed. I wasn't at the location when it was robbed (thankfully), but I received a call when I was on my way telling me that my pizza wasn't done. I guess the thief stole it.... Anyway, I waited a little more for them to make my pizza, but they did give me a free 2-liter and were completely apologetic."
just went in today to get new tires and 1 of the new tire they gave me was 10 PSI lower than the recommended air pressure. I later find out there is  slow leak on the new tire. \n\nupdated: Had to get it fixed next morning before work. They were quick to fix the problem. i was told there was a leak on the sensor probably from the tire change.  they apologized and cleaned my tires so i moved it from 1 star to 4 stars.
"""Love Lulus! Who cares if it is authentic or not! I wonder what authentic \""""Asian\"""" food is really? \nLulus is fast Asian food... and furious...and cheap! It was a regular go-to lunch joint while I was in school in Oakland. The school days are behind me, but I still look for opportunities to go get a bite there when I can. I like their noodles, the rices, but the small plates are my fave. The pad thai is pretty decent (again, I don't know what authentic is, if it tastes good, I will eat it).\nThe bubble tea, however, is not the best. The tapioca pearls are a little too hard for my liking. The actual tea part is delish!"""
"""I switched from Associated Bank to UWCU when I was 16 and will never look back.\n\nI honestly can't imagine going to any other bank, even when I leave Wisconsin! Let's be honestly, with mobile check deposit now, I probably won't ever leave this establishment. The customer service is 10/10 every time, whether it's in person or on the phone, and they really helped me make the best choices when transitioning from teenager \""""I HAVE MONEY\"""" land, to my first credit card, to post college life.\n\nAll in all, I love you guys!"""
"The folks there were a solid group who knew their business and got the job done quickly and professionally.  They knew what the car needed, topped everything off, adjusted tires, etc.  Went above and beyond and were very quick.  I would most certainly go back again."
This may very well be the dirtiest strip club in town.  And I mean that in the best possible way.  'Nuff said.
"This is a great local fish store.  So much more knowledge than you'd get in a big box pet store. The folks who work here know what they are talking about - and if they do not know an answer to your question, they will find someone on staff who does.   Great selection of saltwater and freshwater stock and accessories.  I try to steer everyone I know who has or wants a fish tank to shop here.\nAs for negative review about service, I will concede that sometimes it can get crazy on the weekends and it can be hard to get help quickly b/c so many customers and too few employees.  That said, I've learned to lurk near the employees I have dealt with before and catch them as they finish with others or go to the counter and ask for help."
"Serious local hang. Never a dull moment. yes, there's kareoke, but I promise it's not annoying. Most people here know how to sing and pick out fun stuff."
Great customer service.  They had a lens there that was sold out EVERYWHERE.  The only places that had it in stock were marking it up 2x the retail.  B&C were honest and sold it for the retail price even though no one else was.  Thank you.
"I go once a year on my birthday.  I also know not to expect good or fast service at this location.  Love the food, never have room for dessert, and I go home and my clothes STILL smell like fried chicken.  ha ha ha, good stuff."
"The type of place where you chill with your bro friends have bro drinks together, and have a broment. \n\nOr you can come here after you are finished eating at q bistros. \n\nPlace is located on spring mountain and jones, it'll be on your right; inside the infamous icy juicy plaza. Walking in the vibe of the place is very relax and trendy. Along with billiards they have some cheap beer and a jukebox that can play anything! Seriously that box has every genre from every time period. \n\nOne small thing that bugs me is how smokey and dirty the place is :/ But it's still a definitely a to go to place at night time."
"Every other review hits the nail right on the head with this place. They've all gone into explicit detail, so I'll be brief and just say this:\n\nEach time I go to Island Style, I leave very full, very happy, and with most of my cash still in my wallet. I honestly can't pick a favorite dish because they are all triumphs so far and I try a new one each visit."
I like this bar a whole lot better than Mulligans down the street. Better food and prices with a better atmosphere. The burgers are quite good. They are cooked to order to your preferance and a loaded up one with fries is still under 6 bucks. The draft beer is super cold and reasonably priced. There are your typical bar neccesities like TVs and pool tables and a jukebox. Its a dive bar but who really cares. You aren't paying for ambiance. I've never won a dime on there poker machines but i am not much of a gambler so i dont complain about it.
"Cheap, tasty, delectable chicken that makes my mouth do a happy dance? Check.\n\nSaid chicken meal including taters, hushpuppies, slaw and a roll? Check\nCheap coffee for under $.75? Check\n\nCharging for mustard and hot sauce? Check (being a frugal girl, this would bother me but they only charge a modest amount of $.05 so I can justify spending the extra nickel plus it amuses me)\n\nPeople watching aplenty? Check!\n\nGrease stain on my shirt? Double Check!!!\n\nPrice's has everything I want yet don't need that's why it's only a once or twice a year stop for me. However, I didn't go last year so does that mean I can double up this year? We shall see."
I just wanna say first that Dimitri(if I misspelled your name I apologize)was THE man! He was on top of everything helping make sure that we were comfortable in every way. He was so good I told him I wish we could keep him with us the whole weekend. Being picked up to go back to the airport was nice with Miguel as well. Very nice and polite guy. Came in a stretched out Escalade. You guys know what you're doing when you hired these guys. Very good customer service. We appreciated that. Especially coming to Vegas with crappy service from Frontier Airlines. It's nice when someone can change that around. Came with irritated faces and got out the limo all smiles and laughing. Will use you guys when we come through again.
"Pancakes are great.  Many varieties.  I had pumpkin pecan (seasonal) and they were delicious.  I ordered a sausage omelette (4-eggs and MASSIVE) was able to upgrade the buttermilk pancakes for the difference, around $1.70.\n\nThere were a couple small things I did not enjoy.  The parking is limited when busy on sat/sunday morning.  There was a wait around 30 minutes which seems to be normal.  It is cash only.  None of these things ruined my experience but it seems nice to be aware of them.  I will definitely go back."
"can  I just say that I missssssssss this place!  Moving to Chicago has made me give us the best places i.e. this nail salon....  they tend to me and took care of my feet that I get very lazy to do on my own time. \n\noh dynasty, you were so good to me and I had to move 800 miles away. I am so sad"
"There's something incredibly charming about this place. Old and kind of dark, I live a couple miles away from this place and I had no idea it was there. Food was really more 3 1/2 stars but the fries were bomb and I was starving so I'm feeling generous enough to bump it up to 4.\n\nI was with a fellow Phoenician who requested to remain nameless because he is weird. Eh fuck it, I don't care that much, it was Collin S. Mystery solved, woohoo.\n\nNow on to the burgers. All beef ground patty was on the thin side, but I was totally cool with that as it allowed me to pile on 8 feet of toppings! For once I've found a topping bar that wasn't ill-kept and made me feel like dozens of chidren's unwashed hands had been rifling through everything. Flavorful and tasty and CHEAP. Have I had superior burgers? Absolutely! But not for the price of a McDonalds happy meal and that was A-OK with me.\n\nBottom line, Original Hamburger Works is the perfect place to go when you want a quality burger and fries at fast food prices with the luxury of a liquor license."
"Unlike all the burger chains that been popping up around Phoenix, these are Real flame-broiled burgers, not the smoosh it on a griddle until all the flavor has burnt away meat pattie. Not to mention they deliver it at a reasonable price!\n\nMy co-workers and I have this one on or regular lunch rotation list!"
"COOKIE!!\n\nOkay, so I'm not the famous blue puppet, but get me near Dave & Andy's and I turn into the proverbial cookie monster faster than I'd like to admit. Their Cookie Dough ice cream is so packed with cookie dough that I've been tempted to bake it. \n\nJust in case that wasn't enough, though, they also offer waffle cones that are made in-house, with an M&M treat hidden in the bottom. If you're in oakland and need to cool down, you can't do better than Dave & Andy's for a great ice cream snack."
"I am a huge fan of the Penn Brewery and if you don't know me I am a bit of a booze hound. I love beer! All types, all colors, all ABV's. So I ran in here today for lunch but I  am not allowed to imbibe during work hours. Woe is me....the world is not fair! My point is if you enjoy a beer, just about any type...this is the place to start. I have been here 10+ times and this was my only non-drinking visit. \n\nI enjoyed the Braumeister Steak Sandwich with fries. The food, service and atmosphere were great. Try to find the time to visit this place. Well worth the stop."
"""We've eaten here maybe six times in a year. \n\nWith the exception of the stale bread basket once, everything else has been pretty good. \n\nAlthough I must say I'll never order the French toast made with the Challah bread again. It was okay but not as good at the regular French toast. I think they make the Challah french toast with the stale Challah bread.\n\nMy daughter loves the chicken cheese \""""steak\"""".\n\nWe have always had excellent service every time we've eaten at Landmark and tip accordingly."""
"I have tried just about everything on the Woodland's menu. The food is very good.  Recommended dishes are the rava dosa and idli.   I recommend the weekend lunch buffet before going for dinner.  You can try the sampling of food before you go for dinner.  Dosa is also including in the buffet.\n\n  Service at this restaurant is terrible.  Even when they are not full, waiters are slow.  The food is slow to arrive.  Terrible communication between wait staff and kitchen staff.  This is why I go during the lunch buffet.  Fine place for dinner but be ready to tolerate some slow service."
"Angela is my agent when it comes to need for oil change, etc. I have had my terrain for 16 months. It has needed some attention during that time. Thanks to my extended warranty all parts and labor were covered. Angela is one of the best when it comes to customer satisfaction. She is kind, efficient, prompt, courteous, and just a pleasure to do business with."
"Attended the Slayer concert here a few days ago and generally speaking I was very pleased with this theater. It is in a convenient location and is overall a very nice facility. The sound was very good. The seats were comfortable and the sightlines were very good as well. \n\nThe only reason I knocked off a star is because (at least for the concert I attended), the stage lights were way too much. They had the strongest strobe lights I have ever seen constantly flashing in your face. It felt like an assault on your eyes and not in a good way. I am honestly surprised that there were no epileptic seizures in the crowd. My advice to the light guy: scale it back a bit. You can have a successful light show without the constant flashing of high wattage lights at the audience."
"We just recently moved out of our rental because the owner was moving back into town and was planning on living in the house. We had our walk through last Thursday and just received our deposit back today (a little over a week later). We received the full deposit back. We cleaned the house immaculately but were expecting some deductions for paint touch up and some slight wall damage. However, the owner of the house is planning on redoing everything and decided not to charge us anything. \nOn another note because we were so happy with the service we had been receiving from SWG we decided to use them for a home we own in Henderson. They have been our property management company for that house for almost 3 years and we  have never had any problems."
"The Duck Confit Hash was excellent, even though I've found that duck is not my prime choice of meat for breakfast! \n\nIt is a little pricier than other breakfast spots and very tough for a group to find seating but they know how to do breakfast right!"
"Crane Alley is known in town for its beer selection. They've got like 15 rotating taps and hundreds of different bottles.  The table service has gotten better recently.  I think some bad servers quit or something.  The bartenders who work at night are always knowledgeable about their beer.  They are great at making recommendations.  The menu has a good variety.  Their food specials are usually a good deal too. I went in last friday with my mom, the cute little hostess seated us exactly where my mom wanted to sit (she can be quite difficult) and our server was attentive and friendly."
"Lolo's is ridiculously good! I usually get fried chicken smothered in gravey and onions with a waffle on the side. There is nothing about this food that's good for you, but your taste buds will thank you!\nI've been to Lolo's several times and I've always had to wait in line for a table. Parking isn't so great either, so you may have to walk a block or so after you find a spot."
"""We have now added this to our must eat list while in Vegas! How can you go wrong with 38 choices of omelets and I think I could have sat there and ate the homemade banana nut bread until I popped a button. This is the only place that I have had an omelet and had the \""""stuffing\"""" was throughout.  Our only disappointment was that we found this place on our last day in Vegas so didn't get a chance to eat there more than once."""
"Every time I have gone, I have had adequate space to move around and dance. The sound is good, lights are okay. My biggest problem is the bar area - it's all the way outside, next to the lobby in a small, cramped area with a net that separates the bar from the entrance of the dance hall. I don't like missing out on all the action every time I have to get a drink."
"Ok now- I don't know what happened, or if it's just a different crew, but something happened here and the service has been outstanding. I've had to come here to use the internet for the last week, and they are SO incredibly nice, and always hustling. I can't vouch for the food still, because I'm gluten-free, but smelling everyone else's food is driving me crazy- it smells delicious. \n\nSo as far as Burger Kings go, this one is pretty cool, and the improved staff has really turned things around."
"Instructor very patient and knowledgeable. Contrary to a couple other comments on this forum, I found Rick to be very polite, yet stern when it came to the serious nature of safe gun handling by students. I myself felt a bit uneasy with some student attitudes while on the range. Overall, in my opinion, this class was concise, effective & complete. I plan on taking a more advanced class with this instructor next time I am in AZ. Highly recommend to anyone looking to get their AZ CCW permit."
"Chicken and waffles not much more to say. Fries chicken was great, then only to mix in the sweetness of waffles?! Wish I had somewhere like this in my hometown."
"""If you are looking for high quality sushi, Yummy will be the place for you. If you do come to this place, omakase (chef's choice of fish) will be the only way to go. I heard many people don't care for this place because they come here for their lunch which does not show how fresh and tasty their sushi truly is. Chef Eric is so nice and funny. I really enjoyed the dinner there. Only thing though, omakase here is bit pricy. We spent more than $100 each person here. I can find the same quality of food but half price in Cali. However, since I don't live in Cali so I\""""m willing to pay the price to go to Yummy!"""
"I've been going to Purrfect Auto for quite a few oil changes now, and I've NEVER had a problem with my $9.95 (sometimes w/coupon sometimes w/special deal) oil change. No weird sounds or leaks or anything crazy. What inspired me to write a review was Mark's excellent customer service. Though I needed some other work, I just went for the standard oil change. Mark not only told me what other work I needed (which like I said, I already knew so it was like he was trying to upsell me), he offered to show me what needed to be done. So I went under the carriage with him and his flashlight, and he showed me what also needed to be done under the hood. I have never in my life been shown exactly what needs to be done, and he was so kind and non-condescending.  The only reason I'm not giving 5stars is cuz I've never had anything past an oil change here, but when I do, I hope to add that extra star!"
"I've eaten at John Mull's  twice recently (4-1-2014).  The ribs, tri-tips, sausage were excellent.  The Mac N  Cheese was very good and potato salad was good.  The portions filled the Styrofoam container.  The only complaint I have is the way this place is set up to serve the customer.  It is small, always crowded and takes more time than it should to get your food and pay, then either use  the back door to leave or weave through the crowd  back out the front door.  With all the money they seem to make, you'd think they would come up with a better system to make it easier to get your food and pay without the hassle.   There are tables set up outside to eat your order if you wish, but beware of windy days.  Prepare to wait and be a little confused  when you try this place but the food is good and it is what it is."
"""This venue is so small, poorly ventilated, and just plain seedy to put it nicely, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. The Trunk Space has blown my mind with music I doubt I'd stumble upon any place else.\n\nThink of the strangest musical act you've ever seen, and Trunk Space would book them. In between sets, feel free to grab a drink at their espresso bar. They also have some pretty unique soft drinks, like \""""Leninade\"""", or Ginger Beer.\n\nAt some times it also acts as an art gallery. Hell, I've even seen improv comedy. Truly worth a shot no matter what you're in the mood for.\n\nSome argue that this place attracts too many 'x', where 'x' is a group they just can't coexist with for a two hour show (usually teenagers and hipsters). Those are the only people not welcome at the Trunk Space. The rest of us will have a blast!"""
"""Sometimes I wonder why people can't just appreciate a great sports bar.  If you want fancy food head to South Park.  If you want a quiet dinner...you may want to pass.  BUT if you want every sports game on a gagillion flat screens, a fun covered patio, great drink specials and the best tater tots in town than you have found the place.  I work across the street and this place really works on creating a \""""Cheer's\"""" like environment.  Bartenders and regulars get to know you.  People do not feel strange sitting at the bar alone.  And I will admit to doing some of my online work here using the free WiFi.  \n\nGo...grab a cheap beer...watch a game...say hi to a bartender and EAT THE TOTS!"""
The Green Valley Grocery is pretty spacious and organized fairly well. Clientele is better then any convince store off of Nellis. Not a single pan handler or crack head at 10pm... am I still in Vegas? Well worth the drive to grab a few necessities with out the smell of urine and broken dreams.
"My favorite thing about this place: it's walking distance from my house and I can wear sweatpants there with no judgement. Or maybe they are judging me. Oh well.\n\nMy buddy Vijay and I swung by for dinner last Tuesday. I was super bummed when I saw that the special the night before was meatloaf. However, it was my lucky day. They still had meatloaf left! Hip, hip... hooray! No mashed potatoes, though. Sigh, guess I have no choice but to eat delicious mac n cheese. \n\nWhen in Rome, you have to get the chili. We couldn't decide which one to get. Our server suggested mixing two together. Brilliant. We went with Texas and Southern. Texas is on the spicy side. I liked the combo of the two. Vijay also got a burger. Holy. This thing was huge. I was shocked when he was able to eat the whole thing. \n\nI have to get up here on a Thursday. Why? The special is chicken and dumplings. Sounds like the perfect meal on a chilly night. Not to be confused with chili...."
"Yes, I agree with other reviewers - they do brew a good cup of coffee. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I believe that they're coffee is smoother in taste. The pastries in the glass case didn't appeal to me too much. During the summer month, Steep & Brew place a vendor at the farmer's market square. They're blueberry iced coffee is a must try!"
"""If you want an upscale atmosphere and like martinis you should check it out.  Some might consider it to be \""""pricey\"""", but like everything in life you get what you pay for.  I recommend the Butterfingertini."""
"Now here's the type of restaurant I don't get in Valley City! The Caspian Cafe's specialty is Persian, and it's very interesting to try. It's not my favorite, given that there's quite a bit of cheese on several of the menu items, but not on everything. The soups are pretty good, and their specialty items are what I would recommend the most. Oh yeah, I tried tabouli for the first time here, before I really knew that I loved it, so I definitely want to come back just for that."
"Just a donut shop nothing more.\nThe secret is in the donuts though, they are made of pure goodness, each one meticulously created. I'm pretty sure they sprinkle crack on them because these little doughy nests of love are purely addictive. \n\nMy first dozen was a mix of the girls choice, No filling ones for me or crazy huge ones. But I will venture back to get the next dozen here shortly. \n\nIt's a cash only kind of joint, a dozen donuts cost me roughly 8 dollars."
"I live on Mt. Washington, so this place is convenient via incline to try something other than Redbeard's.  The happy hour specials are decent and the app's are tasty and diverse.  \nMy biggest complaint are the wait staff both in the bar area and the dining area.  They are just not attentive.  If you get to the happy hour at 6 and expect to have two drinks, guess again.  They will take your drink order at 6:15, meal order at 6:30, deliver your drinks at 6:20 and return with your food only in time for 7:05 to see if you need a refill.  Ask before the specials end.\nOtherwise, this is a nice change of pace.  From my prior review, the drinks are still pricey"
"A brewery that used to be a church? Does it get any better than this? They brew the beer right where the altar was. It's pretty neat inside. Still churchy, stained glass windows, etc. Once or twice when I went it was a little humid and smelled a little...funky, but it IS a brewery. It's nothing overwhelming that made me have to leave though. To be honest I don't care for their beer too much, it's more of the idea of this place that I love. But the food IS good, I'll give them that.  I would try to go for lunch instead of dinner, because the prices are much higher after 4pm. It's definitely worth trying."
have been wanting to go to this place every time i go to the Johnston YMCA.. but only coz i dint wanna bury myself in guilt for eating out just after gyming id drive past!\nyest finally hubby n me decided to give this place a shot! the place has a nice upbeat feel....rustic furniture and good music with dim lights give it a nice atmosphere! we ordered the pita points with guacamole! that was nice and fresh. then got the bbq mahi taco! oh that was yumm...i was excite dto taste the mango bbq sauce and the white cilantro sauce! am ot too fond of the fish taste being very evident in dishes...this was just perfect!\nwe also got their dessert special..a white choc craneberry cake! it was heavemly..i licked the plate clean!
"""This buffet isn't bad at all...honestly. There was a wide variety of food to choose from. $19.99 per person for a weekday dinner, I got full PLUS my family and I did not encounter any stomach problems. So that's a good thing, right?? =)\n\nPerhaps I'm not spoiled when it comes to buffets. I don't care about crab legs, clams or any of those \""""expensive luxurious\"""" food because it'll all gonna come out of your system anyways. ;) *ahem...tmi...i know* I'm a simple kind of girl when it comes to food. Give me the simple stuff....pizza, spaghetti, eggrolls, sushi, soup, salad, bbq sausage, red velvet cake, cupcakes, cookies. Seriously...food is just food. I rather spend my $30+ that some of these newer buffets are charging on a mini shopping spree. =)"""
"My dad was admitted here last week for breathing problems and had to stay for about 4 days. The staff was really friendly. My dad said that if he ever has to go back to the hospital, he definitely wants to go to Spring Valley.\n\nThe cafeteria was pretty small and didn't have much variety. However, the food they served my dad looked okay and he seemed to like it quite a bit."
"A lactose intolerant person's worst nightmare. My best friend, especially during a breakup. \n\nThis custard joint is truly delightful. They have it all: custard, burgers, hot dogs, and cheese curds. \n\nAfter revisiting that list of food, I'll probably go kayaking on Wingra before indulging as to avoid food guilt. :) \n\nBut really, this place is the place to be if you want a good burger or an icy treat. It has a drive-in vibe, with outdoor seating, only basic utensils to gorge on their food, and neon signage. It's great during the warmer months, but you can always use the drive-thru if you're craving comfort food during the colder seasons."
If you have a Mercedes don't waste your money going to a dealership.Same quality work at a fraction the price.. Friendly as well.\nHighly recommend.!!!
"""This is one the best venues in Phoenix in my opinion for live music. Wonderfully low-lit, divey atmopshere, Great drink prices and down-to-earth crowd with no pretense or attitude. The bouncer/doorman was ALL pimped out and welcomed me with a handshake. This is really a great alternative from hitting a bar or a club. A true gem in The Valley. Only downside is parking. The neighbors don't like it if you park in front of their house-my friend was yelled at by one of them. And they \""""punished\"""" me by positioning their trash cans in front of and in back of my car.  If said neighbor is reading this review, know this: Next time, I'm going to take out your stupid trash cans. I understand it sucks to have people park in front of your house, but I was not loud, nor did I puke or urinate or your lawn, so chill!"""
"I was completely satisfied with my stay.  Quite frankly, I don't understand the reason behind some of the negative reviews.  Hooters is not a luxury hotel and does not pretend to be either.  Hooters is located just off the strip, across the street from the MGM.    First, it was inexpensive.  Second, the rooms were clean and large.  And finally , it had everything you could expect in a hotel- multiple swimming pools, multiple restaurants, parking, cable tv and good water pressure.  Hooters is a short walk from the action of the strip.  Las Vegas is a great tourist destination which you can't experience from a hotel room.  Therefore, Hooters is a great place to sleep, shower and change before you head out for your Las Vegas adventure.  Now, if the place were a dump or if you were expecting luxury then maybe you would  be disappointed.  I would go back again."
"Hands down one of my favorite places in CU.  The prices are very fair, the food is good, they offer a nice variety and the atmosphere is fantastic.  The shakes are well worth every last one of the million or so calories they contain.\n\nMinus one star because they don't handle carry out very well.  I've never had an order get mixed up when eating in, but there's about a 30% chance of a screw-up when getting carry out.  To the credit of the manager, when I brought this to his attention he was really apologetic, personally verified that my order was correct, and gave me my next meal on the house.  So they get the star back =)."
"How have I not written a review yet!?!\nI come here everytime I'm in Vegas for at least one meal. Breakfast is the fave but dinner and lunch are just as good too.\nIt is slightly better quality than what you would expect based on the price. Don't expect high-end fancy strip buffet food; It's good but also remember how much you paid.\nIt is far from the strip and if we didn't ALWAYS drive to Vegas I wouldn't come, it wouldn't be worth the cab fare. It is worth the drive though because it's nice to get away from the strip, the food is good & cheap and the casino is much more inexpensive to gamble in than strip casinos."
"My wife has been craving Cuban food ever since we moved from south Florida to Las Vegas. We came to this place solely off of the yelp reviews. We were NOT disappointed. \n\nPros:\nFood was GREAT. We had no complaints about that.\nOur waitress was nice and we didn't have to wait around for anything.\nNo fountain drinks (Most Americans are fat enough as it is).\nAverage prices\n\nCons:\nLocation. Very sketchy once the sun goes down. If you have a cc permit, it's a good place to use it. \n\nI'm not a germ freak but I know what's used to clean the tables. Our water glasses were sitting upside down on the table when we walked in. I wouldn't put my lips on the table, so why would I want to drink from an item that has been hanging out on one\n\nBesides that SMALL personal nitpick, we WILL be back for sure. Loved the cubano sandwich! I've already recommended the place to a coworker."
"wow, i'm surprised no one's written on michael's yet! this is the place for frozen custard. i can say this because i'll eat there anytime regardless of the fact that i'm lactose intolerant. it's THAT good. especially the turtle sundae. i always ask for extra peanut butter sauce, because O. MY. GOSH. it's delicious. \n\nbest in the summer when you can sit outside. \n\nAND it's in an especially safe neighborhood, what with all the street-crossing flags now."
"I'm not sure I even realized this was here before tonight.  Thank goodness it is!  From time to time you just gotta have some DQ.  The kids behind the counter were pleasant, respectful, and pour a hearty cup."
"The staff is always very helpful and really quick... Even if there's a line, it moves swiftly... The prices are what you'd expect, so there are no surprises there... One of the cooler things about this place is they have a table set up right when you walk in where they put things that are either being discontinued or no longer carried by the store...  \n\nThe parking lot is almost always crazy if you go on a Friday or holiday weekend...  Make sure you go in through the back way and park on the side of the store instead of the front... It'll save you all sorts of headaches..."
"We go here for either my birthday or my mom's birthday. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. The only thing I have a problem with is the spiciness of some of the food we order. Depending on who makes it, it can be pretty mild to pretty hot. But other than that, service is good and so is the atmosphere."
"This place deserves some more reviews, but I'm assuming the owners and their customers aren't the most active Yelpers. I'll be more than happy to explain why I think this place is my new favorite auto shop.\nHonest, Quick, Friendly & well priced. I'm usually not a fan of Firestone's, but I went to this location because a co-worker recommended them.This is a locally owned Firestone, two brothers run the shop. After bringing my car in for a some seriously shaky brakes, I left with smooth brakes- turned rotors, an oil change and tire rotation. I thought my car needed more work to fix the problem, but these guys assured me that this should do the trick. It's such a rare find when you stumble upon a auto shop that you feel didn't try to nickle and dime you. This may not be the nicest looking place or in the most convenient location, but they have earned my return business."
AYCE lunch under $9 that offers every stereotypical Asian food known to white man. Here is a place you will find the strange ppl that live in Vegas. Just another surreal sight to see while trying to get thru your hangover from going to TAO and XS last night you know who you are!\n\nBonus: Mongolian BBQ grill and free Thai Iced Tea.
I always leave with something from this location.  The keep it clean and organized too
"The most honest shop you will find to fix your honda.  James and his crew  are on top their game.  The shop is always kept nice and James has no problem breaking down problems in order of priority to be repaired.  This shop is the only place I trust not only mine, but my entire families vehicles to.  Not only the best service, but always backs his work.  I have never had a problem with James showing me problems with my car.  You wont be disappointed!"
"Have not even taken my children to Sunshine Valley Pediatrics, that being said just made an appointment for my boys. I wish I got the receptionist name that helped with making the appointment because she was so pleasant and helpful. Very accommodating actually asked if my children were more comfortable with a male or female doctor. I am actually looking forward to taking my children to the doctors for a well check..."
Located in the Von's shopping Center(Sahara Pavilion) its pretty much the department store mecca of the neighborhood. Brand Names clothes at discount prices just like the advertise plus lots of odd stuff like sporting goods and toys and what not outrageously low priced. I pop in every few weeks just to see what new stuff they have.
"This is a Breakfast ,Lunch place that used to be beyond Great!\nWe really loved coming here many years ago.\nThe same people worked here and it was always a pleasure to come in.\nFood was wonderful and so was the service.\n\nThen things started to change. The food was not as good,\nThey changed the menu up.  Then the staff started to change.\nWhen you start losing all the staff you have had for so many years something is not right inside the company.\nThe service and food really went downhill.\nSo we stopped coming here.\n\nWell, lately I have been back 2x's. Things are better. They are trying.\nBut, it is still not the same. However, service is fast again, and they do check on you all the time. Food is working it self back up the hill.\nMaybe they should fo more organic or something.\nIt is still a good place, just not what it was."
"Probably the best on campus. They spray A LOT for bugs, which is awesome. They take care of almost everything right away. It's a family owned business and they do a great job. \n\nThe only thing that was  odd  was their payment plan. It was a bit confusing but just make sure to ask lots of questions."
"""This is my go to spot when im craving PHO', its just so good:]\nThey have a good range of pho soups and they have the other rice and vermicelli dishes/bowls.  Really tasty. Great egg rolls! Service is fast as long as its not completely packed and the servers are pretty nice. Just dont get the thai tea because it will be a disappointment!! I ordered it and it came in this tiny plastic cup instead of the tall cup in the picture! soo not worth the 3 and sumtin dollars.\n\ni would have to agree about the msg with one of the yelpers though, some but NOT all of their soups have extremely high amounts of MSG, the egg noodle soups i think/soups other than the traditional pho soup, i had one and oh myyyy never ordered that again!\n\n But overall i would recommend this place, if your looking for authentic Pho go here instead of \""""pho kim long\""""!"""
"Steve was a flash back to the 70's. No hassle, no fuss, handshake sealed the deal. Just a good old fashion business owner doing the right thing for clients."
"This week Capitol Tire replaced my rear brakes. They got me an appointment the next day from when I contacted them, even though they were fairly busy. Sean at the counter was very polite, plain-spoken, and attentive. The lobby was clean.\n\nThey diagnosed my problem (stuck caliper, as expected) and called me to quote a price before doing the work. The price was in the range of what I expect from mechanics. The work was complete that same day and I was charged the quoted amount.\n\nThe inside of my car was not dirtied in any way that I noticed (no greasy smudges on the steering wheel, no stains on the seats, no oily smell). The repairs were apparently correct; my brakes now work as they should.\n\nThis is the second or third time I have been back to Capitol Tire; I return because I have always felt fairly treated and well respected in there. They met my expectations in every way, I have no complaints, so they earned all five stars."
"I'm usually disappointed in these fast food Chinese establishments but no this time! The food was excellent! I ordered a family size meal for about $32 for my students. This includes 3 takeout boxes of chow mein or fried rice (or both) and 3 entrees. We had the chow mein with Kung pao chicken, beef broccoli, and orange chicken. Yuummm!\n\nEverything tasted fresh off the wok and the staff was super friendly. No complaints from me everything was wonderful!"
"Grade: B\n\nGreat food and prices. The snooty, Trust-Fund Liberals sitting at the bar are a bit much."
"Just a great townie bar.  Nothing special about this place, but that's okay since they don't pretend to be anything other than a bar you can go to and have a few beers with friends.  I have never had a bad time here. Most of the college kids don't know about the tap so the crowd is very tolerable.  Prices are great, and the bartenders are genuine and friendly.  The only knock against the tap is that the food leaves something to be desired.  Everything is average and nothing stands out as anything other than basic bar food.  Which I guess isn't a bad thing!"
"One of the foods I miss the most in Arkansas is livermush. I know it sounds revolting (it's actually called liver pudding, which sounds worse), but it is the BEST. THING. EVER. And I couldn't think of a better way to start my birthday than with a big breakfast at one of my favorite spots. I really love Skyland Restaurant. It's locally owned, not at all fancy, and just one of the best bargains in Charlotte. Graham had a Belgian waffle and a side of livermush, and I had scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits and livermush. For about $5.00. You can't beat that!\n\nAnd breakfast was perfect. I hate runny eggs. HATE them. And these were absolutely perfect. They were just the right texture and had a ton of flavor. And the biscuit is one of the best I had while I was home. Everything was delicious, the service was insanely fast and I can't wait to go back again the next time I'm home."
"Super impressed with them.  They got me in at the last minute, and had the car ready to go by the time that I requested (before, actually), despite the fact that they had to do a bunch of extra work that we hadn't anticipated.  \n\nThey were friendly, straight-forward, very good about communicating, and reasonably priced.  Usually, at least 1 to 4 of these criteria are missing when I visit other shops.\n\nExcellent experience!  I'll be back.  Soon."
"There's nothing I don't LOVE about Char's.  Oh wait, they have a tiny womans bathroom and when you stand up in one of the stalls everyone can see you head... weird but when you have a few drinks in you it doesn't bother you as much.  \n\nI love the regular bands, Lady J and Bad News Blues, really great.  The wait staff is always nice and quick to bring back the drinks.  It can be a bit of a sausage fest sometimes but I the guys have always been respectful and I've never hesitated coming here alone for that reason. \n\nThe dance floor is really small but again, once you get a few in you it doesn't matter."
"When I first moved to Pittsburgh, my eyes had a little trouble adjusting to the environment and I went to Dr. Ross because he was near me. The practice is quaint and cozy. Dr. Ross is very knowledgeable and thoroughly examines all eye issues. I had no trouble making an appointment either."
"Went in on a Thursday night. Staff was friendly. Drinks were cheap. They have a $5 minimum charge on a card, but it's a rule that's loosely enforced."
Friendly people. $1 chicken tacos everyday. Very tasty. Quick service. I wish they would maintain and clean the place more though.
"Used to shop this CVS almost everyday when I lived just a couple of footsteps away. The supervisor that was there, Lisa, was really cool and like a friend. Not certain she is still there. The rest of the staff is pretty cool too.\n\nStore is always clean and neat and they typically have some of the best fire sales outside of grocery stores and liquor stores.\n\nWhen I lived out here two years ago, they did have a reputation of hiring some seedy folks. Had one, I'm pretty certain, steal my debit card number and my niece and sister both told stories of checkers offering you everything you were buying for free if you'd slip them a $20 spot.\n\nOutside of that, I like the honest employees and the convenience of being of walking distance when I lived out here."
"Very relaxed place to work on weekends. But many people use the tables for way too long that you will have very hard time to find tables. It's also next to all the sororities so you see a lot of cute girls ;). Great coffee and sandwiches but definitely pricey. If you get hungry, just go to a Jimmy Johns right next door."
I am not a great golfer by any means. But i do love the sport. this course is great for beginners and good golfers alike. It's wide open with few houses in a hittable location unless you REALLY get a hold and slice or pull badly. water is a recurring nightmare and provides some good challenges. Greens were in pretty good shape. not perfect but compared to other courses for under 50 dollars a round I haven't found any better. \n\nThe part that sets this place a part from courses i go to is the employees and service. from the clubhouse counter all the way through to the food service were the best I've experienced.  ll actually have starters rolling around DOING their job and pushing the very slow groups along. My green fee included some draft beers and some food which i didn't plan on. and to top it off unlimited range balls. It was the best Saturday of golf I've had in Vegas.
"I have been with Walgreens since I was a wee lass. In my hometown, you equate medicine with Walgreens. In Vegas, I didn't change a thing and just headed over to this one and claimed it as my own. It's such an easy layout with fast lines and a newly remodeled cosmetics area. It's always well kept and clean - rarely, if ever, has anything I've gone for been out of stock. The pharmacy staff is always helpful and moves in a timely manner. I can drop off my prescription and have it filled in 15 minutes. Great for the gal on the go. Or dude."
"I like this place for lunch rather than dinner. I went for dinner once and was not impressed and it was a little expensive. Best part of lunch is the dressing on the small salads, the lentil soup and the flatbread.  On the tables they have yummy sauces you can add to your meal. They make the flatbread and it is delish! You can even buy some to go."
"One of the best places in Madison for late night food and drinks. I don't usually order something as heavy as a steak sandwich, but if someone else at your table orders one, you will regret not doing the same. Fried cheese curds - what's there to improve upon - but I swear Tornado's is the best. \n\nThe old-timey jukebox in the basement worked the last time I was there, and takes coins. I think it fits the decor better than a giant LCD jukebox would. Late night jams and metabolism-ruining consumption, what more can you ask for?"
"FROZEN CUSTARD!!!!!!!  Do I really need to say more?\n\nthey have different daily specials and their sundaes are ridiculous.\n\nthe first time I was there I just got a chocolate one on a cone.  but when I went back the next day, they had a peanut butter one listed and I asked to try a sample.  It was basically a reese's peanut butter cup in frozen custard form."
"I love this place. \nI read about it here on Yelp and decided to give it a try. So much better than the mechanic I had previously gone to. Initially I had an electrical problem and they fixed it fast and at a reasonable price. \nAfter that experience I decided to bring it back for them to look at a problem  I had with a rattle in the under carriage of my '99 Camry. I had been told by the other mechanic that it was a problem with an engine mount and would cost $750 to fix - when I brought it to Precision I mentioned what the other mechanic thought it was, left it there and got a call later that after noon - it had been a bent muffler pipe and the work had been done for free. Now, I don't think that's going to happen again, but how many mechanics wouldn't at least charge for labor? In these tough economic times it's so refreshing to run in to that level of honesty. This is the only place in Las Vegas where I'll take my Toyota."
"Oh the awesome frozen goodness this place offers. I LOVE the fact that they make their ice creams rather than getting it shipped from somewhere. They have a great selection of flavors; I just wish they would offer all of them everyday rather than a couple of them on selected days. :P \n\nI could see myself get uberly fat off this place. I'm so glad this place is far from where I live or else I'd be in serious debt and/or suffer from diabetes, some kind of cardiovascular disease and just gain weight that I probably won't be able to burn off quickly. \n\nI usually get the Luv it special. It comes with a marachino cherry which I don't care too much for, a great balance of chopped up, semi-salty pecans and strawberries--all topped on the creamiest, smoothest vanilla custard...\n\nAlso, if you're not cool with sketchy places, you might feel uncomfortable here as this place is in a shadier part of town and it isn't well lit at night."
"Great pizza, probably some of the best I've ever had. They're specials are unbeatable. They're wings are good but the bone-ins had a couple deformities which I hate (broken bones, weird shapes, etc). The sauces are good so I usually just get boneless wings. All in all, not a bad place to catch Sunday night football."

"My wife and I , being tired of the normal chain restaurants for breakfast decided to try something new. \n\nMy wife ordered the blueberry pancakes which were GI NOR MOUS... and very tasty.  I ordered the 4 3's which was  3 eggs , 3 bacon , 3 sausage and 3 pancakes and everything was delicious. \n\nUp until the point we received our food our waiter was very attentive , but once we had our food , we saw the waiter once more , and he took my tea glass to refill it , vanished for 20 minutes and by that time i had finished eating and never even received the glass back. Once he came back he helped all the other tables around us and completely ignored us.   It then took 15 minutes for me to track him down to just get the bill to leave.  VERY unprofessional. \n\nThe food 4\\5\nService 2\\5 if that. \n\nWe will be trying it again , but if service suffers , we will have to cross it off our list."
"I've been in a thrifting mood lately and of course couldn't pass up this location.  It's not really bigger than other locations, but it's definitely a place to come and look around to see what is there.  They seem to pack as much stuff in here as humanly possible.\n\nI was on a mission to find an awful picture with a pretty good frame in order to do a project I have on my mind.  So I had stopped at several other local thrift shops and had no luck.  I should note here that I had no luck at this location as well.  But I didn't walk out of here empty handed.  \n\nI ended up purchasing a pretty awesome drop leaf table.  Fits perfectly in my apartment.  The staff here are super polite, they even helped me out to my car after my purchase.\n\nOf course like any other thrift store, steer clear on senior citizen day.  No one wants an old lady beat down."
"The word AMAZING comes to mind. Great place to go and eat until your heart is content. Or until it explodes, whichever comes first. An odd combo but who the heck cares when you are suffering from the blues?\nI recommend, therefore I am right."
"Found my new oil change home here.\nStraightforward work and no pushy overselling.  Not even a transmission flush was suggested..... :)\n\nWas pleased to overhear an employee explain to a customer that synthetic allows you to drive well over 3,000 miles- closer to 6,000.  I have never overheard this at a shop.  Thank you for your honesty.\n\nI made an appointment so I didn't anticipate my oil change and rotation to take over an hour with the shop not seemingly packed, but if quality work takes a little longer and I'm not paying for a 15 minute change I'm certainly not going to get in a huff."
"""I appreciate Lulu's Noodles for what it is - a cheap place for some grub that's not half bad!  Sure, it's not 5-star cuisine, but it's not trying to be.  It's cheap pan asian food and sometimes you just got a hankerin for it.  The Tom Kha soup is tasty and while I usually get the Spicy Basil Noodles, I actually think they should call them \""""Sweet, No Basil, Noodles\"""".  But for $6 something - I'm not going to complain.  They definitely cater to the demographic in the area, but if your around the area and looking for some inexpensive asian place rather than going to Subway's or Quiznos - then check it out.  It won't cost you much!"""
"The bf was so excited about all of the flavors he had seen on the website but was :( when we arrived and there were only about 5.  So his rating is about 3.5.  He said his coconut custard was really good.\n\nMy rating, on the other hand is a solid 4!  The Western is a sure fire winner.  Those salted pecans rule the school!!  I wish I had some right now!  I was worried it would be too much as we were still stuffed from dinner - but it was delicious.  Much lighter then ice cream...more like frozen yogurt but creamier.\n\nThe area is well lit so don't be too scared.  Those pecans are worth dodging a bullet for!"

"""This library is a whole different level. Right near the Carnegie Museum you can also take art classes and I assume drop off the rugrats at the library while you \""""get your art on\"""" next door. They have a very wide variety of books and a nice layout that lends to a feeling of privacy if you want it. Lively without feeling like a daycare center. I found it sort of odd that their feature book section that hits you when you walk in the doors is African American smutty books. I didn't see all of the books at this library but if their collection of A.A erotica is any indication of the breadth of their other genres it is a library of greater magnitude than I have ever seen in all of my nerd filled years."""
Jojo's has been stepping up their game lately...I figured with them u just have to be detailed ...I always get a large well done cheese with 20  sloppy wings ...well done and sloppy are key words here...also their customer service is pretty good.
"Very good food, just alittle on the expensive side. Atleast you get a decent amount of food for the money, service was kinda hit and miss but we were with a big party and were drinking alittle. LOL."
"This review is for the gas filling area in the southwest corner of the Costco.  I've never been on the property before, but when I came from an appointment yesterday, I decided to stop and get gas as there were no lines at all.  This would never be the case in the middle of the day in Summerlin.\n\nI drove in and pulled up to one of the pumps without any line.  The pumps are newer than the Summerlin Costco but the layout is much the same.  I was on my way in just a few minutes and it proved to be very convenient.\n\nConsidering the fact that I'm at the Smith Center so much and which is 1/2 mile away, when I need a quick gas stop, I'll be looking to this Costco more often in the future.  I am a fan for sure!!"
"Dear God, the coconut doughnuts. I love them. It's just doughnut, glaze, and coconut but when they come together the result is otherworldly. I feel certain that it melts in your mouth but, like the owl in those Tootsie Pop commercials, I cannot leave the doughnut in my mouth long enough to test my theory. I want to marry coconut doughnut."
"Dr. McCaffrey and his staff are amazing!  Everyone is very friendly.  I have had terrible experiences in the past so I am weary when it comes to the dentist, but Dr. McCaffrey has surpassed my expectations.  \n\nI chose his office based on online reviews and I am so glad I did.  He explains every procedure and takes the time to make sure you're feeling comfortable.  Keep up the good work guys!"
"La Bamba is a pretty good cheap, 'authentic' Mexican food joint.  It's the closest I've been able to find to the taco trucks I'm used to from back home in California.  Is it perfect?  No, but it's close.  The super burritos are huge, loaded with stuff, and pretty tasty.\n\nMy only real complaint is the cheese they use.  They use sliced cheese on the burritos and liquid cheese on the nachos.  They should shell our for shredded cheese to put them over the top.  And maybe black beans, in place of refried pinto beans\n\nI suggest the asada burrito, add rice.  Make sure you ask for extra hot sauce as it's really good."
"Luv there chicken tacos, as long as they don't fry them to long. My boyfriend luvs the carne asada burritos. We also tried the rolled tacos, they weren't to good reminded me a lot of the frozen taquitos you would buy at the store."
"Simply sandwiches, they may have other stuff on the menu but I would never know because I can't get past the super Sicilian & the turkey. AWESOME!"
"I have back problems (who doesn't, right?), but I found that this location is one of the better places I've ever gone to. They have high end technology that goes right along with a knowledgeable chiropractor and super friendly receptionists. Dr. Palamone is funny, doesn't sugar coat anything, and has a genuine desire to help."
"Some excellent sandwiches. The hot pastrami was sliced so thin that it was like butter. Not the biggest serving size, but one of the tastiest hot pastramis I ever had.\n\nI also had the classic Italian. Very nice!\n\nOnly downside is their chili is kind of like Wendy's. Before purchasing, I asked the order taker how it was and he said that it is real chili with beans and not hot dog chili. That should have sounded the alarm, everyone knows real chili has no beans!"
"I volunteered here with about 20 other co-workers and I full recommend donating or volunteering your time to assist them.  They are the 2nd largest food bank in the country and AZ statistics are not favorable in seniors, families and children not knowing where their next meal is going to come from.  They were extremely organized in getting us all together and I am very proud to have volunteered my time there.  Several of us are planning on going back once a month to give back even more."
"Dined in at Island Style the other day and felt it was worth a 1 star upgrade to a 4.   On my previous visit getting the Combo Plate take out was a bit underwhelming, but this time I got the Bibimbap which was the first time I've ever had the dish and am now currently cursing my previous 30+ years of existence as a result.   Rice, Veggies, Beef and Egg all in a hot stone bowl (I know, I know, you all know this already).   Pretty much everything I need in my culinary life save for whiskey, cheese, and mint n chip ice cream all in one bowl for your dining convenience.   Highly recommended."
"""I'd give this place an extra half star if I could, just because it used to be a Wendy's.\n\nI think this is probably as close to \""""authentic\"""" as you're going to find.  They have all the usual suspects of a Mexican joint: tacos, quesadillas, and of course the salsa bar (I think this was a remnant of when Wendy's had salad bars, remember that?  circa early 1990s).\n\nThe service is good, and the food is delicious.  I would suggest a giant (and they are giant) chicken quesadilla, with a bunch of guacamole on the side.  The cheese is melty and delicous!  I would avoid the steak as it is quite tough, but to be fair I've never had good steak from a good mexican restaurant.\n\nAnd they have Mexican Coke in glass bottles, which usually always makes me go back for more."""
"I was craving for some blueberry pancakes big time and the closest place that I knew was the OPH. We came here on a Sunday morning and we had to wait to be seated even though there was open tables, but the wait was only like 10-15 minutes. \n\nWe were seated in a cozy booth and I decided to get the ham and eggs and upgrade my pancakes to the blueberry cakes. My husband got the irish omelette. Everything came out fairly quickly and I just have to say that the blueberry pancakes fulfilled my craving.....they had this blueberry compote to put on top instead of syrup and it wasn't overly sweet. My husbands omelette was also really delicious! A HUGE omelette and very cheesy! I love cheese! We left full and satisfied and service was efficient minus the cashier which had a long line. \n\nI will be back for more pancakes for sure! =)"
Fun place to get masks for all my robberies.\n\nI joke. but really you can get good masks at Easley's.
"Staci is a true magician! I moved to Vegas two years ago and couldn't find a hair stylist that I liked... until today! I went into Globe Salon with mousy blonde, dry, frizzy hair with split ends everywhere. I left with a hydrated, beautiful beige blonde and a fabulous cut. Before we even started, Staci sat me down and we discussed every option and looked through photos until I felt comfortable. Not only is Staci just great to chat with while getting your hair done, but she even taught me hair tips and tricks while she was making magic happen. I have been to dozens of hair salons in my life and have never been more pleased with the cut, color AND blowout. I will absolutely be back to visit Staci! Thank you, Globe Salon!"
"Dirty, small, greasy, damn AWESOME.  The fish sandwich (i hear) is to die for.  Cheap prices, that's for shore.  Smoke filled divey bar.  I love it.  If and when I'm in the southside, it's always on my list to pop in.  Beware... when you leave you will leave there smelling like a greasy fry cook that chainsmokes."
"Ok so I give this a four out of five. I was trying so hard to give it a five, but nothing here really blew me out of the water. However this place has good thai food, great service, and a cool atmosphere. I will always come back here and enjoy some curry. This is definitely one of the better ones that I have found around town."
"It's Tiffany's. Nothing bad can happen to you there. Well you could possibly spend way too much money, but hey, who cares?"
They get a 5 because there's no 4.5. The service is awesome. Today we came in around 4:30 and the guy taking our order was super nice and genuine. Not fake at all. We had a difficult order because my daughter is allergic to everything and he still made everything seem like it was no big deal. When I gave him the wrong amour when paying he never gave me a stink face. When I asked for extra hot sauce the other attendant was polite also. Then when we were done he came around and asked about our meal. What fast food restaurant has nice service like this. This dude was genuinely nice and made us have a better day and we will g to this location even if it's far because of his exceptional service.\nManager please give this guy a raise! :)\nThe gyro was great. Onions weren't too strong. They actually were sweet. We always order extra meat and it really was overflowing.
"A bit of a wait, but because Of my personal product knowledge, I obtained a decent quote on the work I needed, and they got the job done. I'll go back :)"
"A gigantic reason why I do not frequent this establishment more often is that everyone does.  It's no secret that Michelangelos is a swell intimate coffee establishment with kick-ass coffee, sandwiches, and baked goods.   I adore the selection of board games to play when you and your study-friend need a break from staring at a screen/book.  The only bad is that it is regularly crowded, (at times) hard to get a table, and outlets tend to always be at a premium. (come early and bring a power strip!)"
"I grew up on this stuff... and now that I live in New England, Macayo's is one of the first stops I make when returning home to Las Vegas. My family keeps those ridiculous gigantic margarita glasses at my Grandmother's house, just so they can have one more (this could set me off on a tirade about how margaritas, and mexican food in general should be simple and cheap... but if you are reading this in Las Vegas, you already know that). \n\nThe chimichangas are amazing, the chili rellenos are outstanding... really, I think by now I have had everything on the menu, and I long for it from the other side of the country. \n\nEat in good health, and have a bite for me!"
"The Malai Kofta was delicious.  There are tons of vegetarian options.  Parking sucks in Oakland, especially at dinner time, but it was worth it to brave the hassle for such yummy food."
"""Hey, wait a second. Since when are pizza parlors this cool? Not only are they a sit down restaurant and delivery spot during the day, they turn into a dive bar at night. Can't say I've seen much of that! And the beers are as cheap as they get. $2 pints of Killian's Red? So awesome that my liver just flinched.\n\nThe pizza is just alright. Sweet sauces can be awesome, but only if you have the right crust and cheese to balance that out. On top of that, I know a meaty pizza can get greasy, but Pullano's is excessively so. In hindsight, the $13 for the 16\"""" really wasn't worth it, but maybe if you wait for some of the specials they have on Wednesday, you can sample a cheaper one for yourself. The menu is VERY expansive, too, which tells me you're pretty much gonna get more of the same as far as quality.\n\n3 as a pizza place, but a solid 5 as a dive."""
"ANYBODY CRAVING SPOTTED DICK?!!\n\nIf you've seen King Ralph with John Goodman, you know what I'm talking about.\n\nI stopped by this afternoon to use my $40 groupon. If you haven't heard of this place, you probably would never have found it. It's a hidden gem in a residential area.\n\nI picked up 3 Ribeye ($11.99/lb) and 2 lbs of Korean Style Ribs ($5.49/lb). You can have the steaks cut to the thickness of your liking. \n\nI had the Ribeye for dinner tonight and it was so much better than the Ribeye that Wal-mart sells for the same price.\n\nBoth ladies at the counter were very friendly. I will mos def come back to try some of the other meats."
I was recently scrabbling to find beautiful + tasty desserts after plan A (Cake Artist's Studio) failed.  I called Mirabelle to check their hours (everything shuts down in CU over the holidays) and availability of cool stuff.  They totally came through for me with boxes upon boxes of what looked like had just arrived from a French patisserie but had in fact been baked that morning in Urbana.  They pulled all of this together in less than an hour.  My guests were in heaven as we devoured it all.
I know I'm not supposed to eat there but it's just SO good. All the beef dishes are amazing.
"My wife has been coming here for years.  After a bunch of bad haircuts Misty took great care of me.  Quick, great cut, reasonably priced."
"Now 5 stars specifically for Blair at the Bobbi Brown counter - because she was just AWESOME!  Super nice to both me and my friend and totally helped us out.  Granted, she ended up making a huge sale, since my friend was specifically there to get some makeup from Bobbi Brown, but that's besides the point.  Because we could have easily walked away if she got ugly.  \n\nWe didn't really peruse the rest of the store though, sorry.  This is why I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5, since the 5 would really only be for Blair, and not really for the whole store."
How can u not give this place 5*'s cone on people. Can u say ice cream.....yummy\nSo thy just open the girl wanted on us was very nice and pretty fast. We got a HOT fudge sundae and truffle blizzard. Soooo good.
"""My former manager at work came across this place completely by accident one day, while delivering a document to the owner. She is a Southern Belle, to put it mildly, and had some of their fried catfish while she was there. Well, she enjoyed it to the point that she brought about six of us there for dinner the same night for an impromptu \""""staff meeting\"""".\n\nOur group tried several different dishes, from chicken to shrimp to the \ndifferent kinds of catfish on the menu. No one had a complaint about anything they tried and I thought my blackened catfish was quite good. The star of the show is the fried catfish, by far, as I later learned. \n\nI've been back a few times since, once for a sit down dinner and a couple of times for takeout. The place has a small-scale, \""""home cooking\"""" feel to it and don't be surprised/too disappointed if they are out of a few menu items. The location is sort of scary after dark, but the food and friendly staff are worth it."""

"Rose Tea does Taiwanese food very, very well.\n\nFYI, Taiwanese cuisine is different from typical Chinese cuisine in that it tends to be milder and lighter with some Japanese influence (there are exceptions, of course, such as beef noodle soup).  So Rose Tea is a perfect alternative if you're tired of greasy Chinese food drowning in sauce, but don't come in expecting classic Taiwanese dishes to be bursting with a gazillion different flavors and spices.  You may even find it bland or boring, but then you'd probably be the type who mixes all the flavors and toppings at Razzy Fresh and enjoys Panda Express.  For me, though, Rose Tea hits the spot.\n\nThe place is always cramped and service tends to be rushed and impersonal, but it doesn't really detract from enjoying a casual meal."
"Just got a haircut. Being on a chill NC vacation I decided to seek out a haircut to soothe my head in this hot weather. This place is located on central avenue in east Charlotte. While the outside isn't the nicest looking neighborhood, the inside is kept clean (much cleaner than your average Chinese barber in manhattan) and the staff is friendly and speaks fluent English.  They spent a good amount of time on my hair and lo and behold it came out gelled and spiky like a good sonic the hedgehog haircut should. I also saw an Asian guy coming in afterwards who they seemed to recognize as a regular rockin a long haired old school Asian haircut.  There were also pics of white people on the walls so it looks like they got the skills to cut all sorts of hair. Two spikes up!"
Update: One word... COCONUT COCONUT COCONUT.\nUpdate to the update: pass on Mango - just something off about it.
"My dining experiences here have been pretty solid, contrary to the other reviews.  I've only come here once for Mangia Mondays and several times for half price after 11 pm.  I think the food is better than Fuel and Fuddle (although I am the only person I know who hates F&F food), and the drinks are tasty, too.\n\nService is acceptable, and the decor is cheesy, but I come here for the food.  The only thing I dislike is the increasingly limited half price menu.  At least the prices are reasonable anyway."
"Crane Alley receives an admittedly very biased 5 stars from me.  This is partially because they're currently carrying two Bell's beers on tap (Amber--divine, and Hopslam 2X--10% abv and so magically sweet AND hoppy that Teej, my fiance and I decided that it must pour directly out of the Easter Bunny's anus...the most magically sweet and hoppy of all the rabbit anuses, as you know).\n\nBell's aside, Crane Alley is a place I want to be at all the time.  It's dim, but not dank.  Tasteful, and not over the top.  The waitress checked in an appropriate amount of the time, was friendly, and had mad non-spilling-the-water skills when pouring all the way to the top of the glass.  I had the falafel pita, which was only 'okay', but was later upgraded to 'good' when I added salt and pepper.  It came with quinoa tabbouleh that was the slightest bit creamy, and oh-so-plentiful.  Mmm....quinoa tabbouleh."

"""Good chinese food in vegas?  Yup, I was pleasantly suprised.  The food here is standard chinese restaurant food, good but not excellent.  It is better than what I like to call \""""Chinese Themed\"""" restaurants that you'll find in the casinos.  Trust me, it's better than the strip stuff."""
"I've been going here a lot(pretty much a regular you could say.) It's a good place to include in your bar hopping plans. Wandos too busy? Fooseball taken at Vintage? Swing by Red Shed. It's also one of the few bars you can actually have a conversation at some  nights. One of my minor complaints is the jukebox. If there is no songs playing..it's just that--quiet. And at certain points in the night, you can hear a pin drop. Lines for the bathroom is sometimes annoying and I've felt really bad for the ladies here who have sometimes waited 30 minutes before the line moved one person :P"
"VEGAN DONUTS OH MY FUCK\n\nis pretty much all that needs to be said. Day two of APP, my friend Lilly showed up with a few boxes full of vegan donuts and It was perfect for that morning.\n\nGranted, I'm usually semi health-conscious, so I totally felt unhealthy for eating vegan donuts like 6 times while I was in Vegas.\n\nSo worth it. Will be going back."
Super late night grub! Can't go wrong with Boston pizza! It's cheesy and full of flavor! We also ordered a 40 PC chicken wings w/ranch. Now that ranch is no joke! It's nice and thick but creamy tasty. Wings weren't that great. It seems that the later time you come they side foods are old and dry. Except (pizza) Don't know if anyone can relate? Last time my chicken wings were old like if they have been sitting under a heat lamp or something. I'm giving it 4 starts because of the disappointing wings
"Heaven in a box! This tiny little dump is amazing.\n\nI got a little nervous when I pulled up and I saw that the restaurant was more of a four walled building with an oven inside than an actual sit down place, but I was not disappointed. Big portions, great taste, and good value.\n\nOnly drawback is that the sitting area isn't air conditioned so in the summer it gets pretty toasty and there are a number of flies buzzing at your plate. Nevertheless, the food is awesome and I'll definitely be going back."
"I've heard a lot of people speculating on the authenticity of Aladdin's. I'm not that familiar with Middle Eastern food but everything I've eaten from Aladdin's has been delicious.\n\nThe service has always been great too. It's never been slow or inattentive. My only complaint is I wish they'd give you some complimentary hummus to go with that plain pita they serve every meal. I guess it's a way to get you to order hummus as a starter; you can't say no when there's pita in front of you!\n\nTheir fruit smoothie is smooth and sweet without being overbearing, the inclusion of honey is a nice touch, giving it a bit of added depth.\n\nWhile I cannot comment on the authenticity of their entrees I can say that their desserts are not authentic at all. At the entrance, behind a glass display, are a variety of yummy looking cakes. I'm not one to balk at cake but I wish the display was filled with baklava, jalibeh, and a bunch of other Middle Eastern desserts to fit with the restaurant better.\n\nAuthenticity aside, I can at least say they do better than most Chinese restaurants do when it comes to representing their country's cuisine."
"This is definitely our go-to place for Vietnamese food.  The owners and waitstaff are great, although like so many others have said, I hate the loud dish banging when they are clearing a table."
"One excellent way of following the Reduce and Reuse parts of the 3 Rs especially when you are on a budget is by getting replacement parts for your computer system for real cheap here.  For example, you can get optical drives or PC power supplies for 5 to 20 bucks. Want an extra PC system or laptop, or need but don't have one because of the cost? Browse the inventory here and you'll likely find what you need and not put a strain on your budget. It's obvious that Westech makes electronics easily available to those who normally can't afford it and those who just don't want to spend much; but also, their resales and donation to local charities and schools keep the electronic equipment out of landfills, thus helping tackle the problem of e-waste (electronic waste), one of the biggest categories of solid waste. Getting great bargains for electronics while helping the environment - who wouldn't feel good about that?"
"One thing that the strip is lacking is quality traditional breakfast food at a reasonable price. So if you're visiting Vegas put OPH in your gps and discover what the locals already know, it's one of the best breakfast restaurants in Vegas.\n\nNo, it's not unique, in fact it's a franchise, but that doesn't change the fact that it's good. Try the potato pancakes with apple sauce, or the banana pancakes with strawberries! There are a million pancake variations to tempt every palate. And if you don't feel like pancakes they have a variety of other great breakfast fare including omelettes, crepes, and waffles. \n\nBottom line: good service, great food, reasonable prices."
Just moved here and have several chronic illnesses to negotiate. Dr. Taylor has been very thorough and empathetic. Never have trouble getting an appointment.
"It's hard to get great thai food in vegas as we have a lot of good options. Komol however, stand out above the rest.

Many more vegetarian options can be found on page 23 and do not hesitate to ask questions!"

No, but pretty darn good, and you can see it cooking over the wood.As for the  complaint of soggy bread ask for your sauce on the side,they don't have a problem doing that for you. I do that all the time, long drive home and the bun will get soggy.The fries are always under cooked, you have to look at that as a good thing if you get it to go, you get home and finish them off and you get nice hot and crunchy fries.

"Ate lunch at Courier Cafe today. I had not been here for quite some time.\n\nWe had a short wait to get seated, which was understandable since we came just after noon.  I would probably prefer to come for breakfast, but that wasn't in the cards today.\n\nThe service was very good. Our waitress was polite, food came in a reasonable time, and drinks were refilled regularly. We were also brought our check in a speedy manner, which I always like.\n\nFood: I had a buffalo chicken wrap, my wife had a hamburger and my son had a reuben sandwich and fries. All the food was very good.\n\nThe only negative is the scrum at the front door/register when you are on the waiting list or paying your bill. Of course, part of the charm of Courier is the old time feeling the place gives, and a large waiting room would probably detract from that.\n\nNext trip: breakfast!"
My favorite pizza. There is something unique about the spicy sauce that's awesome. The crispy crust is nice as well. The downside is it is more pricey vs other chain's significantly and sometimes you wait on hold a long time when placing your order. I would eat this once a week if it weren't for the price/affordability vs Pizza Hut or Dominos as my kids could care less about the quality difference.
"How nice are the people at the Hyatt?\n\nSomehow our reservation got lost - and after traveling 8 hours it was wonderful to have a very friendly staff member take care of it in one breath. Oh, and for our trouble? A high room with a view.  The place was clean, all of the staff was friendly, and it was quite swank!  The bar and grill downstairs had nice couches to sneak away from the conference and grab a brew to watch football with.\n\nMy only recommendation would be to help the valet out with recommendations and directions -- or to have the concierge man the desk a bit more."
Friendly and accommodating. Dr Strickland was able to fit me in the same day since I was suffering from extreme back pain. My pain has been considerably reduced after one visit. He is also very knowledgeable and takes time to explain things to his patients.

Good beer selection and friendly wait staff. We were the first ones here before going on to a party. Apparently I blinked because the place was suddenly packed and loud. \n\nWe had a couple beers at the O next door waiting for this place to open.  They should open a little earlier on the weekend.
"I love Michaels! It is hard not to come out with nothing, unless you are broke.\n\n- have a smartphone handy, and look for a viewable coupon on their website to avoid the hassle of printing coupons. Show it to the cashier and get your deal of the week!\n\n- scrapbook paper selections are awesome!\n- bakery supplies for decorating a cake\n- lovely variety of Christmas ornaments\n- and the list goes on\n- a tad bit messy and cramped in the store\n\n- the minus, wish they had a better selection of floral decor. Also, even with the coupon deal, the savings are not great at all. Better off with Pier 1 for better selection that even they do not have for skinny tall vases."
"""I've been here for lunch several times. The soups are excellent and not what you'd expect from a \""""sports bar\"""""""
"""They didn't invent the chicken sandwich, they just made it better. Much better!\n\nThis location is right next to a McD's an Arby's and a couple of sub places, so it's always hopping busy. Never stressed, the crew here seems to do a solid job and they've yet to mess me up.\n\nI don't want to look under the covers and find out if Chik-Fil-A is any healthier than McDonald's. I'm just going to continue in my intentional bliss that it's chicken and therefore it has to be better than anything that Mickey D's has to offer. La la la la! Not listening!\n\nBest invention at the Fil-A? Waffle fries! OMG, perfection. I could eat these all day long.\n\nOne tip. I really can't stand that pickle on my chicken sandwich. Even if I take it off, the taste is still there. They'll make you a fresh one if you ask. I just always forget to ask. Argh!\n\nOther than seeing Dave Thomas in the Wendy's commercials, the Chik-Fil-A \""""Cows\"""" are the best fast food campain. Seeing them on billboards and in commercials with \""""Eat Mor Chikin\"""" is always funny. Nicely done, guys!"""
"Sorry, guy, everyone I know loves this place. Sure there are a few things I didn't like, but most are tasty, fresh and not at all as greasy or too saucy like lots of Chinese takeout. Highlights include the Lard Nar Pork, Hong Kong Chow Fun Beef, almost any noodle bowl, the Teriyaki Chicken Salad. And the gyoza appetizer, so yummy! As a group, me and my coworkers like to hit it once a month. For those who might peruse the menu, Yum Wok is the more mainstream Chinese menu, LuLu's Noodles being a collection of different Asian noodle dishes.\n\nupdate - When I wrote this there was only maybe one other review. I hear you guys. Yeah, don't get the stuff that's not Chinese. You are NOT going to get good or authentic pad thai, or teriyaki chicken, or udon.  You will usually get tasty, not overly greasy, Americanized Chinese food. Although the gyoza is very, very good."
"I've ordered take out a bunch of times, and they've always had my order ready by the time I got back from shopping at the 7eleven kitty corner to the location. The thin crust pizza is on par with all the other major chains. My only issue is with their pepperoni, which are fairly narrow slices that curl up and pool the grease as the pizza cooks. I usually do a pat down with a paper towel. The staff are friendly and seemingly efficient."
"Each Chinese fast food place is different and each has their own speciality. This place's speciality is their wings and their crab ragoon! We love it and order often. The owners are really nice, especially the wife! \n\nI gave this place four stars because I'm not a big fan of their rice. as a chinese place, rice is important to them. In the past, my rice was always hard/crunchy and dry. Cooked with the bbq pork makes it smells really bad. Thats just me though. I don't eat take out rice often so I don't mind not ordering rice with my dish."
"I know it's probably un-healthy, but I think their sandwiches are pretty delicious. The sandwich hits the spot quit well especially when you're starving for a late lunch around 2pm. What I love are the extra stuff they put on your order (of course they're optional, but I put everything on - I can't do without pickles and jalepeno pepper). I really enjoyed the veggie mushroom sandwich, but i got turned off just a bit when I realized how greasy it looked with the melted cheese .... . \n\nThe service is quick. The staff are very friendly. And as everyone mentions, the price is awesome (especially for students)."
"Came here while in Pittsburgh for work. Got the Pazzo Cheesesteak , very good. Ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza to go, it was excellent. Parking would be the worst part, but I'm sure the north east are is a lot different than Houston, not everything is in a strip center lol."
"I liked the atmosphere and staff a lot. Very nice and easy to communicate with. I didn't have a wait at all, and was in and out in less than an hour. \n\nI had a mani-pedi and felt relaxed and pampered. The scrub and hot towel treatment was Devine. \n\nNormally before I go for a pedicure, I always trim my own toenails because I always find, wherever I've gone, that the nail technician cuts them too short and I get an infected ingrown toenail. Well, this time I forgot to pre-trim and I allowed the nail tech to cut them for me. Sure enough, she went too short. It hurt the next day and when I was at Disneyland 4 days later, I had to wear flip flops so it wouldn't hurt more. But I blame myself more than I do the nail tech. \n\nOverall, I am pleased. I'll definitely return again!"
"I have to return to my review of Esquire and give them an additional star.  There's less of me since the time I bought my latest suit from them, so I took it back for alterations.  I was slightly worried, as such things don't always go well, but they did a fantastic job.  The suit looks better than ever!"
"A lot of people say this place isn't that amazing. I think it has really good food. It is one of my favorite places on State St. to get some quick chow. I usually get a burger there, but I have also gotten other sandwiches. Good fries too (spicy ones are the best). \n\nThe service is the only reason that it isn't five stars. You do have to go get your own food and order it at the counter, but that doesn't bother me that much. You also have to get your own water, which is annoying if you are at the outdoor seating. Overall though, the counter service and bussing service is really good.\n\nThe outdoor seating is really nice. There is usually somebody singing or making music outside, which adds the atmosphere. The indoor seating is pretty good too. There is artwork on the walls from local artists and it is usually decent.\n\nOverall, 4 stars for good food and good atmosphere."
"Live nearby and can't believe I haven't been sooner. Guess because it never seemed busy. \nIntimate place, great for couples or double date. \nVery good seafood at reasonable price for a higher end restaurant. \nGood wine list. \nG\nTry the most excellent creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e - one of the best in Madison as they add a little liquor to the sugar before carmelizing the top and it is outstanding. \nAlso, sides are very good and reasonably priced. \nService last Friday was excellent. We went in late, and they made us feel very welcome and not rushed at all, which is more than one can say for some of our other high end restaurants in town."
"I was very happy to find this decent local breakfast place. Does a good business on the weekends, but we've never a wait to be seated. Friendly service. Nothing fancy or trendy but made better by the absolute lack of other options in Waunakee. That said,my eggs are always perfectly done and my daughter makes happy sounds when she eats their biscuits. The only disappointment was the hashbrowns which are pretty dry and tasteless.  Easy to miss it tucked in a strip mall by the hardware store, but a safe bet for a good breakfast if you are in the area."
"""I was skeptical about this location thinking that it was a \""""We Proudly Brew\"""" kinda joint. However, I'm happy that a co-worker brought me here on Monday! I desperately needed some caffeine but didn't want to walk to Market Square to my typical Starbucks location. I ordered a Pumpkin Spice Latte, and it was perfect in taste and temperature. Plus, this location inside the Omni William Penn is positively gorgeous. I'll be back!"""
"If I need wings, I head to Wing King.  I live a block from a Wild Wing and I STILL drive miles to go to Wing King.  It's a little gritty on the inside, but that only guarantees great fried meat.  The service is friendly and fast, but the parking can be a pain since you're fighting a dozen other shops in this gas station/strip mall.  My favorite wing flavor is the salt and pepper.  Huge chunks of ground black pepper and tasty salt crystals flavor the wings perfectly.  Their house salad is huge.  It is a great item to split.  Top everything off with some of the best ranch dressing around.  I have never been disappointed in the King."
"The parking lot is tiny (but at night you can use the neighbor lot since the stores are closed). Once you walk in it looks like a sushi restaurant with a sushi bar. Then you walk through to the 2 grills and the more private oriental style tables. In the next room is regular tables. The 2 grills use 2 different chefs, facing opposite directions. While we were eating we were watching the other chef in action. Our chef was funny, both chefs had prank tricks, and the food was some of the freshest tasting japanese food I've ever tasted. The fried rice was amazing, the chicken and shrimp were perfectly seasoned, the salad dressing was perfect, BUT the miso soup was...eh. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."
"Shootz is more than a Pool Hall. They have Ping Pong, Dinner, Karaoke and other random specials. The tables were recently re-felted, so the greens are a little fast. A variety of people hang outh there, so, you're never sure who you will run into."
"Where the professional landscapers go and worth the drive to get there.  They have everything and lots of variety in potted plants, trees, shrubs and flowers.  Also a good selection of mulches, fertilizers and those smelly chemicals to kill pests and encourage growth.\n\nMost importantly, they have experts there to guide and advise you.  If they don't have it, they will tell you where to get it.  And they also have people who will help you load your car with those heavy bags and plants.\n\nI don't know quality, but our landscaper buys from Roundtree exclusively.  Our beds and yard plantings are full, fresh and healthy looking when he brings them in.  You just have to be impressed and once they take root, they grow well and full."
"""I was looking for a barber shop to get a standard old-school tapered cut. I vaguely knew of this place because I'd walked past it on my way into the Concourse, where my wife and I stayed during our wedding. I just assumed it was expensive and fancy because it was in the Concourse. \n\nWhat I found was a great, classy, old-school barber shop. George was a very skilled men's barber. He also has someone who cuts women's hair. He was very attentive to anything I wanted with my hair and continually touched up the fade even after it was \""""done\"""" and he had moved on to other parts of the cut. He used hot foam and a straight razor around the bottom (I wanted it REAL short there) and it was just fantastic. The price was pretty great too. I will definitely be going back here."""
"I am probably not the best person to be reviewing this as this was my first time ever at a driving range. It seemed really nice and it was easy to get a basket of balls and find a spot even on a beautiful day when it was packed.  While my golf skills were not what I had hoped, I will definately be going back."
"Baja Fresh is always good, clean, quick and reasonably priced. Not authentic? Who cares! Tastes great to me."
"The bread here is amazing. \n\nI guess they close the place down, clean out the ovens hardcore and bake all the gluten free goods once or twice a week.  Some stuff is sold fresh and other stuff is frozen and sold  all week. \n\nBesides bread, they offer fresh pasta, cookies/muffins, croutons, and pizza crust.\n\nTheir cakes look pretty terrible though, they bake em in a square tin pan and frost em like my kid brother frosts his brownies... they should get a cake decorator!"
"I'm in college, i eat a lot of burgers. this place has always had the best hands down. people say the owners changing ruined it but i've been going here since 1994 and its still F***ing epic. if you want the old people to 'chill' with visit the diamond but if you want awesome food, service, and atmosphere, go here."
I walked in to get what I figured was a two hundred dollar tire and to my surprise walked out with my tire fixed and back on the road for only a thank you . Just needed a valve stem.way to go Goodyear goodjob!
Wonderful atmosphere to study and meet with friends. Lots of seating and a great location with good drinks. I'm giving it 4 stars because I've had problems with the workers not greeting you up front and having to wait or going to find them.
"We've been patients here for 15 years. We started coming here when we bought our first puppy on a recommendation from that breeder. \n\nWe have lost our oldest dog, but still bring our other two dogs and we also brought our two litters of puppies here for care.\n\nWe now live on the other aide of town and still make the drive just because the drs here are so fantastic.\n\nThe staff is very helpful and friendly and always explains everything and gives us different treatment options.\n\nI wouldn't even think about trying anyone else."
"This state street whole in the wall offers a vast array of two kinds of dumplings-meat or potato.  I get half-and-half.  Spicy or not, free bread, drink and sour cream for five dollars.  One thing, done well."
"You can definitely get more for your money at Costco but do be prepared for the crowd and the lines.  We shop there at least twice per year and save big on fruits, vegitables, wine, and certain meats.  If you want higher grade meats, you'll still need to spend a bit more at a butcher, Fresh Market or Whole Foods.  I've purchased, in some cases, 75% more food for the same price as normal grocers.  We primarily eat by the Paleo lifestyle and this is the way it's affordable.  We steer clear of the massive tubs of ice cream, mayo, and all that stuff, but I will say Costco can also be just as great of savings for the unhealthy eater!  Lots of food for the money!    \n\nPick high travel times wisely!  I would recommend steering clear of Saturdays!"
"i was considering giving this place 5 stars, but after trying out multiple flavors i have come to the conclusion that only their birthday cake flavor is really good so no. 4 stars only. not a must-go to place but probably the best ice cream there is around pittsburgh"
"My boyfriend and I were escaping the hell known as Charlotte Restaurant Week from a well-known steakhouse chain after being shoved into a tiny table in a ridiculously loud restaurant, and decided to come to B&B for a good steak.  I'd never been, and it lived up to it's charming, old-school reputation.  The wait staff was terrific and friendly, they squeezed us in at 9pm, no questions asked, the petite filet was moist and delicious and perfectly cooked, and the stead fries were crispy and fantastic.  The prices were reasonable, and we had a wonderful (and quiet, and better lit) dinner.  Would recommend to anyone for the quality of their steaks (my boyfriend got the ribeye and said it was terrific).  And THANK YOU for not participating in Charlotte Restaurant week...very few do!"
"I called Presidential Limo in Vegas because they had the best price. Typically in life, things that are less expensive are less in quality but with Presidential Limo, that is simply not the case. I was so impressed by their prices and their service on the phone with the booking process was flawless and easy. I was lucky enough to have driver Ron and his beautiful stretch limo. He opened up the bottom of complimentary champagne for us when we got in and had roses ready for my girlfriend making our night even more romantic. It was so classy and impressive, definitely the only way to travel in style in vegas!"
"KJ KITCHEN, has reallllyyy yummy food! some dishes that my family loves to order are: deep pan fried noodles, fried chicken with duck sauce, wonton soup, salt pepper shrimp, fried shrimp tofu, &walnut shrimp. all taste delish! and their food comes out fast but their service aint all that. countless times we asked for more water and napkins, and it took forever! but i forgive them for that bc they were soo busy during mother's day dinner. the seating is very close to one another and wish i was able to push my chair back without hitting the other party that surrounded us."
"Interesting dessert tour in the pink Sherman tank style jeep things.  Well built. And very nice driver.  The drive was bumpy and it threw us around. But that was part of the deal we signed on to.  Just be ready for a rough and tumble drive.  \n\nMy wife was not thrilled, and there were some very uncomfortable moments, but worth it in the end, if you like being outside in 100 degree weather - and we do.\n\nWe took the tour of the dessert, the trip to Hoover dam was too long for our plans.  But the dessert was beautiful and the woman driving was very knowledgeable."
"""This is the S-bux I go to when our \""""Bored Meeting\"""" can't go to the Craig & Tenaya location.  That's because it is open until 11pm vs 7pm .\n\nThe staff here are very good & friendly.  Drive-thru is usually entertaining for those sitting out front. Strangely, inside is typically filled with laptopers, the result being, at night, there doesn't seem to be an empty seat.  Since it is at night, outside is usually quite pleasant.\n\nA few times I have been here at close, I got to experience a \""""free pastry pass out.\"""" I'll let you figure out what that means.\n\nGreat staff, pretty busy, lots of outside seating (insert into nutshell)."""
great place they help me almost everything that  i had to replace
"""As far as Americanized Chinese goes (neon sauces and gigantic portions of food and MSG), I think this place is excellent. Obviously it's not grade A in appearances or uniqueness but the flavor and quantity is there for a great price. Really, really fast service, and it is crave able.

"""This place was amazing! Great \""""street food\"""" and great price!  It was a very sad day when it closed for good....."""
"I was really craving some Middle Eastern food.  I moved to Pittsburgh from Brooklyn and was having a hard time adjusting to a lack of cultural cuisine until I found Khalil's.  It is a mom and pop place, kind of a hole in the wall, but has fun, if shabby, decor like Nights of Arabia, but the silly ambience makes it more fun in my opinion.  The food was really good, authentic tasting. I have spent significant time in Egypt and Jordan and can vouch for the authenticity of the flavors.  I had the Feast which is more than enough food for 2 people- pita, hummus, salad (with a ton of fresh feta), dolmas, lentil soup, shrimp, kofta, lamb and chicken kabobs over rice with roasted pine nuts, and a dessert (baklava).  The total bill with wine and beer was $48 and we had a to go bag.  The waitresses were also very friendly and the food came out quickly.   I can't wait to go back to this place"
"I love NTB. They didn't have any rims, but once we got a rim, they fixed up my car on New Year's Eve and got us back on the road earlier than they said they would. These guys were SO nice too! They along with Spitz Auto saved our weekend. If not for them, I would have not gotten to see my family. Thanks NTB!!!"
"In the past month, I've been here so often that the barista almost has my name down! Not my order though, but that's quite all right, especially since I like to switch it up.\n\nThe nice thing about this location is that they're open until 10 pm, unlike other nearby Starbucks. Their service is quick and friendly too. They'll even bring your drink to your table instead of calling out your name or order. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating for you to enjoy your drink.\n\nUsually, I wouldn't consider writing a review for a chain location, but this particular Starbucks is a welcome exception. Keep it up!"
"""We've used Warren several times now and most recently when our Furnace took a dive in the middle of the icy doldrums of February.  \n\nThey're fast and efficient.  The service techs are always polite, pleasant and knowledgeable.  Most importantly, the prices are always very affordable.  Even an emergency service call on a Sunday didn't burn my pocketbook.  We'll definitely continue using them as our \""""go-to\"""" heating and cooling company!"""
"Stayed here this past Saturday night for a Steelers game.  I was fearing the worst from the reviews, maybe setting low expectations improved the experience.\n\nThe hotel was great.  Clean, comfortable, decent price, friendly people, free shuttle to and from the game, and quiet at night.  No complaints, i'd stay here again if I was in town for a Steelers game."
"I miss Noodles! This was a weekly staple for me in my college days. It's nothing fancy but it is good, cheap, and fast. I wish they would open in Charleston!"
I want to live in the store. FOREVER.
Another successful service done by Colburn ent. Toilets were fixed. I no longer have to hear them running. Appointment was quick and easy to make. And service was inexpensive.
"I bought a hookah almost as a joke on vacation one time. Once I fell in love, I wondered where around here I could replenish my supply. The tobacco I bought before was a joke compared to this selection. They have all of the best products, excellent sales, and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The location and clientele may seem a bit foreboding, but ask an employee for any kind of help, suggestion, or product and you will not leave unhappy. Also, I usually consider trinkets as useless clutter but they have a wide selection to fit anyone's tastes, and I have surprised myself by leaving several times with a little buddha figurine or a porcelain origami crane that just called out to me as I walked by with my Starbuzz."
"107.5 is one of the radio stations I listen to regularly. I wouldn't exactly call it 'extreme rock' as they call themselves, rather it's more of an alternative rock station... Sometimes they can overplay certain bands, usually when those bands are about to play a concert in Vegas \n\nDave and Mahoney are the morning DJs now, while I miss hearing Adam Carolla, these guys are pretty fun as well. \n\nI'll be honest, one of the main reasons I love this station is because I have won LOTS of cool shit from them. Tickets to all sorts of events like midget wrestling, Strikeforce and even a sold out UFC fight! I also won free window tinting for my car from them a few years back.\n\nIf you like alternative rock, 107.5 is really your only option is Vegas these days..."
"What it lacks in hipness and personality,  it makes up for with kick ass coffee. Never been disappointed here."
"""An ode to my neighborhood pizza place....\n\nDear Fox's Pizza Den:\n\nYou are two blocks away from my house, yet sometimes I am too lazy to come get your delectable food offerings.  You don't judge me.  You just bring your delicious treats right to my door.  \n\nI love you for your regular pizza with my favorite doughy crust, real mushrooms and enough tomato sauce for all my saucy needs.  I also love you for your specialty white pizza.  I enjoy your white pizza for its mozzarella, tomato and spinach winning combination.  Sometimes I'll even throw in our friend chicken to add in some much needed protein.  But most of all (and surprisingly) I love you for your \""""healthy\"""" option, the Taco Salad.  Fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, tortilla pieces, SOUR CREAM, taco flavored beef and salsa.  Who am I kidding, you're not healthy at all....but I love you anyway!  \n\nYou make me feel good inside and that's what's most important!  \n\nLove Always,\n\nRachel"""
"This place is delicious,  I haven't been here in years and visited last week. The food was as good as I remembered but the chick peas were way under cooked. I showed up at 2 pm (not knowing that they closed at 3) and felt rushed. Just go at an appropriate time so your food isn't under cooked and to where you feel you must gulp your food down. Still delicious - just go at a good time."
"It is not often that I give a place a second chance, but it does happen and I am glad that it happened with Landis. After my rather scathing review I received a message from them, the contents of which shall remain between me and them. I thought it was so above and beyond to personally respond to my review that with a little nervous trepidation I took a bike I needed the bottom bracket removed from in. Well they just lived up to every positive review on here about them. The mechanics were friendly to me, pulled the bottom bracket and hooked me up with a bike box that I needed to ship a frame. It was a great experience and they can definitely expect me in there again and soon."
"""Great food, great service. I realize it was mid week but I was one of three tables. We need to support local gems like this or we will be stuck earing at chains and being told how to eat a \""""happy meal\"""""""
"""Never been there but I do order bulk pipe tobacco on the phone. If your ever looking for a good tobacco that can beat \""""early morning pipe\"""" by Dunhill, than order-up a pound or two of Daybreak.

"My first try using yelp. We where at North Las Vegas, and saw this restaurant on yelp. We gave it a try. I'm not a fan of spicy food, but the owner makes you choose your spiciness (on a scale from 1 to 10) first time I took the duck curry, it was delicious, the size of the meals are enirmous! (especially for the price you pay) The second time I got the Bamboo Spooce salad, which I didn't like, but it was the first time I tried bamboo, so it's just probably my taste. Oh, and the owner gives 10% if you check-in!"
"Excellent food most of the time.  I would come here fairly often during undergrad, once I realized LuLu's was not that great.  \n\nReally, you should go here for the bubble tea which is quite tasty. I am a fan of the dumpling, pan fried noodles, and braised pork.  The other reviewers are correct in saying it is not as good as it was, but it is still decent."
The people here in the morning are great. Very friendly and helpful.  The building is really old and the parking lot is very small. Those were my only complaints.  The food was made correctly and hot.  The manager in the morning is very nice. They were actually getting a safety audit during my visit and scored a 98.5.  So the food was safe as well.
"""Soup, sandwich and chips. 8 bucks. Pretty damn good for Charlotte. Soup is always great. Except that one he put grits in that time. He's like the \""""Soup Nazi\"""". I imagine he's nicer though. All kinds of different flavors you'd never think of. I loved the French Onion Barley. Fabulous. Had the New York Reuben soup today. Wonderful. The sandwiches always fill you up. I've only had the Chicken Bacon Cheddar and the Corned Beef and Swiss but I order them again and again. The waitresses are very friendly and attentive too."""
"I recently became a bird mom to my grumpy 24 year old Amazon, Kermit. He has been living with my Grandparents since I moved away from home 13 years ago.  When my Grandmother passed away, he finally came to my house.\nThe owner, Angie, is very knowledgeable,  and you can tell is very passionate about birds. She is full of great advice about your bird.\nShe has an entire wall of toys of every shape and size, and another wall full of food and treats.\nOn top of offering items for exotic birds you can normally only find online, she also offers grooming services.  She trimmed Kermits beak and wings with no stress to him,which is super important to me. In the past, vets have said he needs sedation for trims and she was able to do it without any restraint. \n Will be back when his beak and toes are ready to be trimmed."
"Rich, thick and creamy.  Who knew that custard can taste so good.  I was expecting something eggy and flan-ish.  My buddy told me about this place but I went in blind not reading any reviews.  They've got multiple flavors and frozen custard has such a thick consistency.  Definitely worth a try especially on those hot summer days in Vegas.  This place is not in the most savory of neighborhoods so don't try to walk there, Take your car and be safe."
"I first took my border collie mix to Alta Vista to be spayed. They took such good care of her. The staff was friendly, timely, and informative. There was an issue with the price of the medication and they worked to find me alternatives that would help bring the price down. \n\nI then brought her back for updates on all her shots and some light grooming. I received phone calls from the doctors asking me questions and giving me information. \n\nBut Alta Vista has been great even after I moved out of town. They were kind enough to contact another kennel and provide confirmation of her vaccinations, when I was unable to locate a copy. \n\nI highly recommend you give them a try."
"Great timing, forgot my oil change last time, and in 35 mins was done."
"""I've been here several times, and about 75% of the time, the food has been fantastic. Other times is has been average, which always to turn out to be slightly more disappointing when you are expecting something great. The menu changes around occasionally. I've had two different chicken dishes that involve cinnamon.. Both great. Pasta dishes tend to be average, and meat dishes are a 50/50 on how well they are prepared. The fried zucchini planks appetizer is almost always perfectly made, but the portion is large, so I recommend sharing it with at least two people... Otherwise the taste of \""""fried\"""" just gets too be too much and may ruin appetites.\n\nThere is probably something here that virtually everyone would like, so it's a good crowd-pleasing/first date place. The desserts are indeed delicious, but the dinner portions might leave you very full and with a doggie bag.\n\nI would not suggest going here too late/close to kitchen-closing time. The food tends to be not as hot, since they probably make it quickly and leave it warming until you are ready for it."""
"Your standard Jimmy Johns.  They made your subs fast, empty your wallets even faster.  This place was great since last year I lived in PAR (worst dorm ever at the time) so it just was a quick walk/bike ride away.  I don't order much from here anymore with so many other options around, since I live pretty far away from Lincoln now, but if you're in the area and looking for some quick food, definitely the place to stop at."
"Dude, how can you complain about a place that let's you in FOR FREE?! I had a lot of time to explore downtown one day because I was a lonely tourist with a whole afternoon to waste so I visited almost every museum in Madison that day! This one was by far my favorite! It was clean and quiet, had lots of open spaces with a beautiful glass stairwell. The artworks on display were cool, there were some 3-D pieces along the floor and one that had broken TVs playing that annoying white noise, but as you got closer there was a giant waterfall projected on the wall, and you realize that the sound is the same and suddenly it's so relaxing! Stuff like that. The gallery itself is not that big but I liked that it was manageable. Some museums have too much to take in and you don't really get to enjoy it. This one was a good size. Not too crowded either."
"Okay...so I'm liking the Boston Store. I've NEVER really taken the time to shop here, mostly because 75% of the items here are overpriced. However, I've gotten good at shopping the clearance racks. You can find some great deals if you're willing to take the time to browse. Also, I broke down and got the card, so I get coupons ALL the time. All. The. Time. Like, once a day...maybe it's a bit stalkerish. BUT, the $50 off $100 coupon I got the other day makes the flooded inbox worth it. \n\nBottom line: If you're willing to dig through the racks, and come in with a coupon, you can get great merch for decent prices!"
"I could describe each delicious morsel of each of the donuts that I tried but I would hate to deprive you of the experience yourself. Here is what you need to know- amazing selection (almost too much to choose from, you'll want to but a lot), fantastically tasty donuts and so affordable! We thought that we had been charged incorrectly because our total was so low considering everything that our group purchased. Not so, Ronald just makes super donuts at gear prices. If I lived in Vegas, I would be a regular!"
"""The Rose Tea Cafe is probably the most \""""Chinese\"""" Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, offering authentic food that most nearby delivery Chinese joints wouldn't even know how to cook.\n\nWhat does that mean?  If you've grown up eating Chinese food from American restaurants, some of Rose Tea's more eclectic fare may take some getting used to and some of the standard dishes (you know, the Sesame Chicken, the General Tso's) may taste a bit different.\n\nMy advice?  Be adventurous.  Try something that sounds weird.  If you like it, yay!  Otherwise...uh...try something else next time.\n\nThe lunch specials (that cover the front of the menu) are an excellent deal - especially if you enjoy their egg and vegetables or order a bubble tea to go along with it - and the dishes aren't too weird.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is also nice.  It's small and cozy, with the tables far enough apart that eating doesn't feel cramped.  It can get quite loud inside, but that just another way Rose Tea makes it feel like a little piece of Chinatown in Pittsburgh."""
"5stars only because our waiter was flipping awesome!!! His name was john and he's in school for business great great great! Sadly I dnt like hot food lol I'm not a spicy food eater at all. I tried it though, our appetizers were fried crawfish tails oh they were soooo good && fried shrimp!!!!"
"""For sure the best brewery in all of Las Vegas. They brew some great craft beer here, really great beer!\n\nFor as big of a city Vegas is, I was always disappointed in their offerings. I'd been burned by some of the bigger and more advertised breweries in town, but Tenaya made up for all of them.\n\nI'm a hop head, so my favorite offerings are the Hop Ride IPA and the Double Tandem Double IPA. Both are solid and have everything you could want from a west coast IPA. If you're not into the big hop flavor, give the Red Ryder a go, it's an excellent balanced beer. And I've never been a huge brown ale fan, but their Calico Brown is damn tasty. And the Pilsner is a very approachable, easy drinking beer that I would recommend to anyone that says \""""I don't like beer\"""". \n\nI like how they both sell bomber bottles on site, as well as fill growlers here. If you find a beer you love, getting a full growler for enjoying at home is the way to go."""
"The food is as elegantly presented as the bright naturally-lit space, and despite what you might expect from a room with floor-to-ceiling windows, the daytime ambiance transitions nicely into an equally intimate and romantic evening. There is so much attention to detail here that makes dining at L'Etoile a very special experience, including the special filtered water they serve which has a barely noticeable and very pleasant effervescence to it. \n\nMy dining companions had great luck with their dishes, but unfortunately my quail was a bit dry and definitely over salted for my tastes. The desserts were beautifully presented, but did not match the sophistication or delicacy of other parts of the meal. For example, the gelato we ordered was swimming in a sticky sweet fudge sauce and the three of us were unable to finish it. I would not recommend coming here for dessert. \n\nDefinitely take advantage of the suggested wine pairings if you plan on having any wine with your food - they know what they're doing here. Overall, I had a great experience and I am glad I tried this place."
"""I know my way around a car store like I know my way around a vag...er, um, wait. Have I used this line before? Anyhoo, YAY for Firestone and for keeping track of my battery purchase. My mechanic misplaced the receipt but it doesn't matter cuz I\""""m in the system! I'm somebody! I get my free under warranty battery today and a chiseled, tattooed person to install it for me. No money outta my wallet. And no grease on my delicate skin."""
"I was glad to see the management response to my Yelp review, and I recently needed some new furniture so I decided to give Walker another shot. This time was much better. The sales people didn't stalk me like predators, and the salesman we did have was actually very knowledgable and understood our wants and needs instead of trying to push whatever he wanted to sell on us. The check out process with the customer service desk did seem a little better this time. It didn't make me outraged, and the staff was okay, they just seem a little apathetic toward their job. All in all it was a MUCH better experience. Looks like that employee training paid off!"
"My go to place if I need something in the kitchen. They have tons of pans, utensils, plates, and front of the house service equipment. A lot of equipment here are professional grade meaning they use them in restaurant kitchens. It is open to the public so anyone can come in and buy an item. If you're looking for what the chef's use, this is the place to go. The prices are reasonable here, compared to a lot of restaurant supply stores that overcharge for their items. Service is friendly and knowledgeable. Plus, if you are looking for a particular item, they will go out of their way to either order it, or find a suitable replacement."
"Here tonight to try dinner. What caught my eye was the nachos and bratzel with fries. Should have just had the nachos as that was a meal in itself. If you have ever had Big Dogs' nachos you know what I am talking about. The order is so big, it would easily feed four or so. We asked them for a half order and still it was a huge portion. They layer the cheese in between the chips and pile on the sour cream, jalapenos, black olives, tomatoes and guacamole. You can add meat like chicken, taco seasoned beef, or shredded beef for just a little bit more. \n\nOnce they have it all together under the salamander it goes and it's heated all the way through. So the chips on the bottom are just as warm, crunchy and smothered in cheese as the ones in the middle and on top. \n\nMy bratzel is a hamburger with bacon, bratwurst sausage, crispy thin rings of onion, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and of course the pretzel roll. Cut this baby up into four's it's enormous. I enjoy Big Dog's its always fun to dine in or late night, eat at the bar."
"""This is the thing I miss the most about Pittsburgh. Salim's has the best gyros I have ever had. their cheese pies and meat pies are also delicious. They make everything in house. We ate at Salim's at least once a week and never had bad food or bad service. We were always greeted with a \""""hello my friends' and left with a grateful \""""thank you\"""". You are doing yoru self a disservice by not eating here."""
"When I'm evaluating a vet, I rate them on their (1) trustworthiness, (2) prices, (3) hours.  This place does well in all three categories.\n\nI found them trustworthy because I came in just for a general checkup and to get my dog current on her vaccinations and they didn't try to recommend a lot of additional services or treatments. In fact, when I asked about whether my dog needed her teeth cleaned the vet was honest and told me that my dog could probably go for 1-2 more years without needing a teeth cleaning. She also recommended a good toothpaste with enzymes in it (sold for $8 at the front desk, which I felt was a reasonable price for a large tube that will last me a long time).\n\nPrices are very fair. I don't remember exactly how much the office visit was, but certainly less than I've paid at other places.\n\nTheir hours are awesome. They are open late on weekdays and open on both Saturday and Sunday. great for when something happens to your dog on a weekend, you don't have to wait until Monday to bring them in for treatment."
"Good grub, simple surroundings.\n\nSoups were awesome, portions large. Fish and chips very good.\n\nFried seitan was disappointing, chunks too big and no batter. They need lots of work. Double wide makes superior seitan wings.\n\nCourtney was a perfect waitress. \n\nFood is well prepared and tasty. We left stuffed.\nCheesecake was awesome. \n\nThis was not just heated up frozen foods, but crafted food.\n\nService was excellent. She knew what we needed and delivered"
"Nice facility. Had doctor JAcks. Friendly and informative. They took my blood onsite and I didn't even pass out! They do take you into an office to give you a book and go over financial paperwork. I was just there for some bloodwork on a routine issue so going over financial stuff seemed overboard. Lots of people here though are obviously there for radiation, Etc. I saw the treatment room and it looked comfortable with lounge chairs, books and blankets. Nice place. No complaints."
"Johan is Cuban. Cuban is good. Johan in a white navy uniform? Very, VERY good!  \n\nHe took care of our bachelorette party and especially the bride to be. He was amazing, nice and definitely sexy as hell. \n\nOG as a whole...cheesy. However, when you must, you must! I didn't like when the men horded our table upon arrival.  That was a little pushy. They are kind of in your face at first about lap dances. The drink service was also very slow. Get tanked ahead of time and take the free limo. Save money for g-string stuffing :P\n\nIt was a ton of fun and if you just go with the cheesy flow you'll have a blast!"
"""Great atmosphere.  Old church and high school (St. John the Batist) in the Bloomfield section of Pittsburgh, which now smells like a brewery.  Decent food and decent draft beer, but they were our of (real) IPA both times we visited.  They peddled something they called \""""Belgian IPA,\"""" but it didn't have enough hops to taste.  They were out of their real IPA both on tap and in bottles both times we visited, about a week apart.   \nThe atmosphere, food, and beer are all better than average, and that's a strong triad.  They also have sweet potato fries.  Despite the deceptive (deficit) IPA availability, we still ended up going twice during a 2 week visit to the \""""burgh.  MEL"""
"Caliban Book Shop has to be the most remarkable bookstore in the 'Burgh.  It isn't quite a used bookstore.  You don't go here expecting to find used paperbacks of Steinbeck or Dickens.  No, this is really much more of an antique and collector's bookstore.  As a reviewer on another site says, the first thing you notice upon entering the place is the sweet scent of old books.  I found an old book on pop music once as a gift for my dad.  He really loved it.\n\nThey do get used textbooks and not-so-rare paperbacks too.  So if you want to escape the look-alike world of the major chains (Barnes & Noble or Borders, not that there's anything wrong with those places) then by all means, drop in here!"
"Solid Thai restaurant.  In the same rundown strip mall as Lotus of Siam, so it often gets overshadowed.  But, the food here is really good, and it's a lot easier to just walk-in to get a table or get a reservation for a time you want.  \n\nThe first time I went here, I was ready to give it 5 stars.  The food we ordered was excellent.  Tom Khar Gai soup with chicken, herbal salad, papaya pad thai.  But, when we ordered delivery from this place, we found that the food we ordered the second time around was meh.  The regular pad thai and pad knee mow are very good as well.  \n\nI will definitely be back again at some point, but I'll make sure to stick with the dishes above that I know are excellent."
"Dr Teng completed Para esophageal Hiatal Hernia surgery on me in September 2014. I chose Him because he has extensive experience as a General Surgeon. He lived up to His positive surgical reputation. With any surgery there are risks and not everything is always perfect. With that said, I have had minimal side effects to this point, 2 months later."
"Several reviews stated that patrons will actually gorge themselves on boxes of donuts...while dining inside.\n\nI had to see it for myself.\n\nSure as s**t, squeezed into the corner booth were four people, each with a large pink box, and each eating out of those boxes.  The legend is true!\n\nSpectacular fruit rolls and chocolate cinnamon twists.  The owner was as pleasant as could be.  I supposed I would be, too, if my humble donut shop had such a cult following.  Well done."
"Pros:\nOLD SCHOOL, I've been going to this place ever since I was a kid.\nIntroduced me to that wondrous thing called the gyro.\nThe meat is always juicy and filled with spice.\nThey offer hot sauce, which tastes amazing on a gyro if you ask me. \n\nCons:\nA tad steep.\nI've always been a bit off put by how it's trying to be like McDonald's Greek Style. :/\n\nI've been going to Gyro Time for as long as I can remember. I don't go as often as I like seeing the prices but man is this some good comfort food. Don't forget to try the baklava."
"I love BF. They have the best burger deal in town. Burger, Fries and Drink super cheap. Their burgers and fries are one of the best in Phx! What is really wonderful too and extremely, outstandlishly ( Is that a word?) delicious here is their Breakfast Burro. Who knew? Huge, cheap, tasty-YUMMY!  It is actually one of the best ones I have ever had. They use real sausage too. Check it out.The place is a dive though but you know what they say about divey places having good food.  If you go through drive in be careful it has a strange scary curve. They say a lot of accidents happen in their drive through so no drunk or hung over food runs, OK?"
"Best BUBBLE TEA in town.  They're a bit inconsistent about the bubbles - I think they may let batches get pretty old before pitching them and making more--as bubble tea fans know, it's ALL in the bubbles.  So while not every bubble tea I have ever had here is awesome, they are still the best in town."
"Came in on the Sunday before Labor Day and only one sole waiter was working the place with the help of one sole bus boy.  Although it took awhile for him to get our order and clear our plates, he did it all with a smile on his face and, most importantly, he brought the food out right when it was ready.  \n\nI had the cambodian fried rice, which was phenomenal.  BYOB."
"I have been searching for a proper chicken pot pie since the weather got colder & saw here on Yelp that the Roasting Co had chicken pot pies on Wednesdays.  Clearly, I had to check it out.  I did get it to go, so I can't say much on the restaurant itself, other than it's surprisingly roomy inside.  \n\nTheir chicken pot pies don't mess around.  The thing is massive!   It's chock full of veggies & perfectly moist chicken with a thin golden crust.  My only complaint is there's not as much crust as I would like, but it's still a great pot pie.  Can't wait to go back & check out what else they have to offer!\n\nAlso, they have Uncle Scott's Root Beer from Mooresville.  Best Root Beer I've tasted."
"This place is like an upscale Homegoods. They sell everything from jewelry to wall decor to beer/wine to glass and tableware. A lot of the items are priced a bit steep... but they are of good quality. However... as others have commented, you can find a lot of this stuff next door at the Bed Bath and Beyond.\nFun to walk around in... but usually a bit outside of my price range."
"Met Hubby here today for one of our last lunches together for the summer. It's the place he (and just about every other state employee, it seems) eats most often. It's a tiny little shop with a few tables crammed in and a mistered patio out back. The walls are lined with AZ memorabilia, license plates, and old timey signs. But for once, they're for real, not the fake old timey stuff that's on the walls of most chain restaurants. I'm lookin' at you, Cracker Barrel....\n\nThey have a great variety of subs, plus soups, salads, fruit bowls, a veritable wall o'chips, and baskets of sweet snax. Get the Rice Krispie treat. You know you wanna. The subs were quite good- and huge. Had I known how big, I would absolutely have ordered a half. Tons of fresh veggies, lite on the mayo, a tad heavy on the dressing. Dallas is right- the ice is awesome. It's the perfect crush, so that, according to my husband, he can keep on chewing it long after he gets back to his desk and NOT annoy the crap out of his fellow cubies."
"Ian's is a Madison staple - and I enjoy my $3 slice whether I'm eating it as my dinner at 6 p.m. or just a booze-sponge around 2 a.m.\n\nThose looking for an authentic Neapolitan pizza might be disappointed. I mean, my last order at Ian's was for a slice of Mac and Cheese and a slice of Chicken Bacon Ranch. Enjoy the biz for what it is: a buffet of affordable, bizarre pizza slices that actually taste pretty great. \n\nMy one complaint is that Ian's doesn't label its pizzas - so I have to try my best to listen while the guy behind the counter rattles the names off like an auctioneer. Invest in some paper and a sharpie, Ian's."
"A nice place that serves great beer. It does not have food. After a couple of beers, you need to leave to get food at another place and finish the day/night there. Bartenders are friendly and decor is pleasant."
"What else is better than sitting in a pit inside a bar that looks like you're inside a volcano??? NOTHING!  (Do be careful though getting into the pit, you don't need to fall)  The decor is amazing, they did an outstanding job to make it feel like you really are experiencing an inside of a volcano, not that I personally have been inside a volcano to be able to compare.\n\nDrinks are amazing, everything you can think of and more.  DJs are excellent when spinning their sounds.  The crowd is always lively.  If  you are in a bad mood entering the place you definitely will leave out of there in a better mood.  \n\nI love being able to just sit and collect my thoughts in the pit.  But seriously, watch your step.  It's great to get down there faster, but not worth the pain."
"Seedy, walk-up window serving up frozen custard!\n\nIt's just off the strip, but the location is pretty ghetto.  What's worse is we couldn't find it at first and drove around even more ghetto neighbourhoods before we found it.  We were almost too afraid to get out of a car until we saw a 6-year old walk up to the window :)  Then we got out.\n\nIt's not terribly different from a soft-serve sundae from Dairy Queen.  The custard is just a lot more dense.  Their junior sizes are still bigger than anything I can finish though."
"Oh how I love thee Urban Outfitters.  This one on State Street is good, a little smaller than most but still good.  I'm just annoyed out of the 2 necklaces I purchased 1 is already broke but it was so cute....  love their stuff but wait for it to go on sale!"
"""I took my daughter (2.5) to Edward's Salon for her first haircut, despite being very unsure about cutting her hair at all! The staff were wonderful and calmed all my fears right away. The hairdresser (who specializes in children's cuts) knew exactly what to do to keep my daughter interested and cooperative - I just sat back and she took care of everything. She even saved the \""""first lock\"""" in a little baggie without me asking. \nI was expecting some distress or even a tantrum, but my daughter was so intrigued that she sat perfectly in the little \""""fire engine\"""" and smiled even when having the tangles brushed out!\n\nMy only complaint about this salon is that their credit card machine does not allow you to add a tip - and you will want to tip generously because they do such a great job. Bring some cash or stop at the ATM in Sentry Hilldale beforehand."""
"Great place to get help for any pain issues.  I have bulging discs and sciatica.  I was bed-ridden for 6 weeks and they got me the ability to move again with no pain.\n\nThey have great things to help between visits, from stretches to ice packs and bands.  The pillow really helps.\n\nI have had Acupuncture, Chiropractic and Medical Massage.  Very helpful when combined and managed.  The Doctors stay connected and shared notes, so it was easy to work with them.  Awesome group.\n\nThey also provide text reminders for appointments and between visit reminders."
"Lately, nights at the Bikini seem to end with the craziest stuff imaginable. I swear, it gets more absurd every time. I'm on a self-imposed sabbatical. \n\nNow it gets five stars."
"This place is pretty special...although, it's in a sketchier part of town.  And since it's in an old house, it's a little intimidating to approach...and even when you walk in, you are smack-dab in the middle of the very small kitchen.  But...oh the smells that come from that kitchen!  Pure Hungarian Heaven!!  The dining room is a little on the crammed side and if you have a large group, expect to be bumping elbows...but, since it's all family-style, you are getting cozy anyway.  \n\nThe food is extremely authentic and Alex makes you feel like you are just part of the family.  I love that the menu changes with the season and that he just cooks what he wants and you eat it or you don't...but trust me...you will want to eat it!!!!  \n\nIf you are expecting a romantic fine-dining experience here...you will be disappointed. There is no sliverware (plastic is what you get)..but, you will likely become fast friends with people at other tables since everyone is in such a happy place whiel they are there.  \n\nGo with an open mind...you will enjoy it!"
"Awesome Italian spot, been coming for lunch for a few months. Staff always friendly. Missing my chicken Asiago melt they franchise took out tho :("
"The wash was quick and fairly inexpensive-- $10. Yes they missed a few spots on the dash but the rest of the car was vacuumed nicely and the outside looks great. Perhaps my expectations were low given the other reviews, but I'd go again."
"Wow, these guys do NOT lie with the name Jiffy Lube! I've been putting off my oil change for a few weeks and wasn't looking forward to going on a beautiful Saturday but it was the most pleasant experience. I went to Jiffy Lube solely because they had a coupon for a $19.95 oil change in the Val Pak that was expiring soon.\n\n I pulled right in, they were very friendly and not one other customer was there so my car got it's oil change right away. Plus they actually had fresh coffee and magazines geared towards women along with a seating area inside and outside so you can watch the cars go by on South Blvd. I was sitting there enjoying the day and kidd you not, not even 15 minutes later they were done. And to make the experience even better, I got a $10 off coupon for my next oil change-boo yah!!"
"Wow, what a really good burger.  Went here on the recommendation of someone local, and i was really impressed.  The condiment bar was great and i like the old style tables.  \n\nThe only negative things i could say is that the wait was a little bit longer than i expected, and the place is a little dark.  they should throw up some more lights, imo."
"""When a personally revered reviewer like Julia S was diggin' this place, I knew I had to go.  Add the backing of Tonya P, Chad E, Faith D, and I knew I was already late to the dance.  So....armed with my strategically purchased (80% off) restaurant.com coupon, it was time to try some papusas.\n\nWanting to taste the broadest swath of offerings. we started with a sampler plate (El Tapatio?).  Holy gluttony, Batman!  There was an ungodly amount of shrimp, beef, chicken, etc. on that plate!  All for a whopping $12.99!  Before we were done, we tasted all manor of papusas and tamales.\n\nIf I had just one dollar for every time I found myself saying, \""""This stuff is just silly good!\"""", the meal would have been free!  When the check finally came, thanks to the aforementioned coupon, I was embarrassed to pay it.  I almost felt like a thief.\n\nGluttony may indeed be one of the seven deadly sins, but I will return to sin some more!!"""
Went here by accident because we couldn't locate the Japanese Restaurant we were planning on visiting.  Alas! This is one of the best I've been to.  My husband ordered the rib eye and this was excellent and juicy!  I ordered a couple of sushi with lobster and spicy tuna.  Also ordered their plum wine which was awesome!  I'll definitely come here again.
"Update- just went there this week and they seem to have upgraded/fixed their furniture. Maybe I'm wrong, but the place looks a little better and the heavy plastic-like tablecloths help, as they look new and give the small room a more uniform (and therefore organized) appearance. If the table cloths are just for Halloween, I hope they replace them with something else afterwards."
"I don't know why other places in town even put fish tacos on their menus. Cabo Fish Taco can not be beat! I've been a fan for years and there is no better meal than chips and freshly prepared salsa before an order of their signature fish tacos (nix the cabbage) and side of baja rice. All washed down with one of their inexpensive, yet effective, margaritas, the el cheapo. All for less than $15! It's a meal that satisfies and transports you miles away, to a place with sand between your toes and worries washed away to sea."
PROS: good ice cream and decent prices\n\nCONS: very busy on Saturday (had to wait almost 10mins) and one of the staff was standing right in front of me texting... that's rude and unacceptable for any business
This place is pretty decent if you want to just hang out in a relaxed atmosphere.  I don't know why the previous reviewers dislike the clientele so much because I've never really had a problem in here and everyone is super nice.  The nachos are definitely excellent so try those.  It's not going to be the same experience as going to a P.T.'s or Timbers but if you want something a little less corparate as far as hole in he wall bars go then try this place.
"Fleet Feet is nothing short of wonderful. I don't go to the South Hills (ughh) for much of anything, but this place is worth the hassle. The staff is super knowledgeable and really listens to what you are looking for. They watch you run and make suggestions based on what shoes will work best for your feet. Do you have flat feet? Do you over pronate? Do your knees bother you when you run? They will pick the best possible shoe for you. And in my experience they've always been right. I've run quite a few marathons in the first pair of Brooks I bought from them (I never would have bought them without their guidance, as they weren't neon pink or something). I've been fitted there a few times and have been impressed with the customer service and care. These people know their stuff!\nI will continue to buy from and recommend Fleet Feet!"
Ishi is a UNCC staple.  \n\nI honestly never ate the Sushi their.  When I went their I either got the Hibachi steak/chicken or the Teriyaki Steak/Chicken.  For a 6 dollar meal it was great and has great portions.  I give it 4 stars for being affordable and I love meat and rice.
"I have been a fan of Hops since my wife was a hostess almost 10 years ago.  The chain has had some financial trouble in the past causing them to close every other Hops in NC.  However the wife and I still make the trip about once a month from Denver, NC to go eat there. Great beer and good prices on quality steaks. I'm picky about buying steak at a restaurant because most place either charge twice what the cuts worth or don't cook it to my standards and Hops is about perfect. They also have a great selection of house brews. You can also take their beer home home by the keg or 64oz bottle."
"I like to eat here for lunch. Their brunch is hugely popular but I don't have the patience for that. The staff is friendly, the food is excellent and there are good choices for vegetarians. I had them cater a lunch for a small group and that was excellent as well."
"I love this place. It is down the road from the main drag of Carson Street- so thankfully, it's a lil off the beaten path for all the student bar hoppers. \n\nWhen you walk in you will notice the horror theme and the drink list is crazy scary like jager and oj. ew. There is always some idoit playing the Uncle Fester Electric Shock treatment game.. complete with shock handles and a smoking lightbulb- haha! There is one pool table and a decent jukebox with guest dj nites.\n\nThe 'special' scary drinks are adorned with lil skeletons or other strange trinkets. The beer selection is top notch - they carry many specialty beers in the cooler.\n\nOne day when we were in town here, like 30 pirates showed up, and no.. it was NOT even Halloween. Good Times!"
"The Wing King cafe does not mess around. As others mentioned, it isn't much of a restaurant. Its somewhat of an eyesore actually, but that kinda adds to the charm. No frills about it. They mean business and it vaguely reminds me of the coop. This is a great find, great hole in the wall. \n\nWings. This place has some of the best wing's I've ever had. 10 bazillion times better then wild wing cafe. In fact I think wild wing sucks. Here, wings are perfectly fried, and juicy. Without sauce they also taste great. They have a multitude, I mean multitude of sauces. As Julie R mentioned, go with the sampler. \n\nThe only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don't frequent it too often and it's out in the boonies in comparison to my location. I also haven't tried anything else on the menu. \n\nBTW: if you go searching for this place, there is a Chinese restaurant across the street called the Wang King Cafe. Wrong spot, don't go there!"
"Got the gyro time sandwich with lamb n beef shwarma, tender tasty meat, good tzaziki sauce, haven't had a gyro in years, this one holds up to most, but one time at band camp..... Oops\nNext time gonna gnosh on the falafel (is that the spelling)? \nFree drink refills, u get fries w the combo for 3bux more....\n\nGyro you later!\n\nCali"
"There are only a few things one needs to know. Ahem...\n\nThey make a lot of bread, so they're good at it. Yet despite fancy names, the bread will taste like most good bread you've ever had.\n\nThe sandwiches are all around $10. They're pretty filling, and if you choose the right one, it can be split.\n\nThere are free samples at the register!\n\nIt's totally not at all creepy to longingly stare through the windows in the back at the bakers plying their trade. Not creepy at all."
"""The 3lb pound mucho matadore burrito is a legit contender for anyone with an abnormal appetite or just really loves their burritos like me. I got this thing on a Thursday night which is also half price Margarita night and yet around 545 the place was not really all that busy. I ordered and was served within 10 minutes. For 11 bucks this thing is a steal as it could feed 2 full grown men easy. I however have an inferno like metabolism with nothing normal about it so lets move on. This thing has everything inside it. Choice of pork, steak, beef or chicken (I got chicken) corn, black beans, lettuce, cheese, rice, bit of sour creme and then topped with mole sauce and sprinkled with cheese. The smell and the taste were genuine and delicious! Scary part is that despite \""""pacing myself\"""" I still finished solo in under 12 minutes and felt pretty content afterwords."""
Unenthusiastic barista but the other patrons were on a first name basis with him so maybe it was b/c I'm a newbie :) Also the manager of the TCBY next door came over and they were all laughing up a storm....I can handle chit chat (I've worked retail before so I'm not too harsh) but when there is a customer right there in front of you sometimes it's better to postpone the conversation a few minutes until they walk away. \n\nAnyways; I got a hazelnut coffee and the beans were ground up right there and brewed on the spot. I don't know if this is normal (I have never had a cup of coffee brewed especially for me before) but I felt special and made up for what was experienced in the above paragraph :) The coffee was a bit weak. That in combo with the lack luster barista I had to knock off a star. \n\nThey also had a long list of italian sodas that they offer and I will have to come back and try one of those out as well!
"We were in dire need of Haribo.  I did a little research before we headed to Madison and was directed to Bavaria Sausage Kitchen.  Sausage and Haribo - yes please!  The shop is small, but well stocked.  Plenty of German and a few Dutch delights.  Due to the fact that they're a pretty small shop, their prices definitely reflect that.  Their prices were a bit on the high side and much of the stuff could be ordered much cheaper online.  HOWEVER, it's always nice to browse in person,  We walked out of there with about $50 in Haribo alone - so obviously, they had a very nice selection!  Tried some sausage as well, the deli sliced Alps salami was ok and their summer sausage very good.  They're closed on Sundays, otherwise, we might have stocked up on a variety of their sausages and other freezer items on our way home.  Overall, nice little place and I imagine we'll be back the next time we're in Madison!"
"Wow.  The food is DIVINE.  I haven't experienced flavors that intense in years.  I would've given it 5 stars, except the atmosphere is way too stuffy for me.  Really expensive great food doesn't mean it can't have a more fun atmosphere..."
"I haven't been here in a while - it is such a drab part of town.  BUT, even with all the time that has passed it is still fantastic.  The neighborhood may be super-sketchy, but after taking out of town visitors to the Mob Museum, this was a perfect afternoon snack.  The custard is truly delicious and I love all of their sundae choices.  I had cheesecake custard, butterscotch sauce, banana slices and chocolate jimmies.  \nEveryone loved their own sundaes and my nephews were happy to see all of the tacky wedding chapels they had heard about."
"A friend told me to come here and try there sandwiches.  Went there to give it a taste test to see what the rave was about. Didn't know there were a chain of this store in Vegas until we got there.  \n\nI asked the guy what's the best sandwich there and he suggested the Bobbie.  At first I was reluctant to order that over the Capristami but ended up with the Bobbie since he suggested it.  \n\nWho knew that thanksgiving left overs would taste so good in a roll the next day? \n\nThe Bobbie is filled with turkey, mayo, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  It's a cold sandwich and it tasted really delightful.  I really enjoye this sandwich so we came back the next day before leaving to get a sandwich for the road.\n\nWe got the cheesesteak with mushroom.  It was slighty spicy because of the chillis but it was really good as well.  Tried two sandwiches from this place and enjoyed both.  Will be back to try the capristrami."
"If you are looking for a Brew Pub with character, then you definitely want to come to Penn Brewery (Hofbrauhaus feels corporate and like it is trying way too hard).  Penn Brewery IS OPEN despite rumors that it might have to move. (I was there last weekend).  The beer is tremendous and the food is actually quite nice (I had ribs that were melt in my mouth yummy).  I definitely recommend this for dinner, especially when they have musicians."
"Because I only come here when I am passing through the Madison area, I cannot comment on the produce. \n\nBut!\nYay for alternative diets and local foods and bulk options and community and Just Coffee! Sometimes the prices are on par with Whole Foods, sometimes they are lower. \n\nAll in all, I love you, Willy St. Co-op!"
"The salt and pepper shrimp was fantastic. I didn't have the opportunity to try the calamari but if its anything like the shrimp, it's probably just as fantastic. My husband had the chicken chow fun with black bean sauce and that was ok. He said he would not order it again because it lacked the smoky flavor that other Chinese restaurants have in their chow fun. The Chinese broccoli was a little aged so some of it was stringy and towards the end there were a few pieces that were gritty.  I would definitely come back here for the salt and pepper anything."
"""Not sure why the rating on this place is so low, but I LOVED this place!  I got a special that isn't on their current menu - tilapia fillet with some type of berry sauce.  DELICIOUS.  The mac and cheese was awesome too - your typical southern mac and cheese.  The chocolate pecan pie was awesome too.  Left the place in that happy-food-coma state.... would recommend to anyone who is looking for a hearty, \""""home-cooked\"""" meal."""
I go here when I don't go to the Square for the other Indian places. Always my favorites are the chicken tikka masala and carrot halwa. The mango ice cream is always good. The chutneys are varied but mango chutney is extra. The naan could be better. The only other negative is the restroom. Its unpleasant.
"the best sauce ever!\n\nrib meat scares me, but the sauce MMMMmmmmmMMMM!!!"
"Food was great!  Service not so great...  When you're paying that much for a meal, the service should be just as good as the food.  Get the bananas foster for dessert, you won't be disappointed!"
"We LOVED the malai kofta here. Really amazing. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes. We were dissapointed in the appetizers though, they use a sort of fluffy batter that is a bit strange. We've noticed this at a few Charlotte Indian restaurants. Seems like a cheap Cisco brand of batter or something. Anyway, would give 5 stars if they improve on that. Skip fried apps, go right for the main meal here and you won't be disappointed."
"So if someone blind folded you and dropped you off at the Yellow Rose...   You would swear that you were in Shelby, NC on the set of East Bound and Down waiting for Kenny Powers to walk in!  \n\nI love this place!  It reminds me of a bar I would see back in my hometown or something you would find out in the middle of South Carolina somewhere, not in the middle of Charlotte.  \n\nPretty much ditto on everything that Tiffany says about this place in her review.  The little bit of food that I've had there has been really good and the waitresses and staff are very friendly.  Seems like everytime I've ever been there they are singing karaoke and they have lots of pool tables that are always taken.\n\nI have to give this place an easy 4-stars on character alone.  And the drink/beer prices are dirt cheap.  Oh yeah, and there is always free popcorn, and it's good!  \n\nA great place to people watch as well!"
"Ok, I think we all know that phat burrito is not authentic mexican but neither is taco bell.Lol But their food is pretty good and the people are awsome. The ingredences are very fresh and  the food is tastie. The atmospher is really chill, and you have a choice of eating in or out which both are great. I would tell anyone to go there"
"The Lake Mead/Rainbow location is the best. The staff is always friendly even when they are slammed. I can't think of a thing I've tried and didn't like. My husband likes really spicy food but me, not so much. I love that we can customize how spicy our dishes are with a number 1-10. He always gets 7 spice and I get 2. \n\nFavorites when dining in are the silver noodle soup, shrimp and cream cheese tempura, pad see ew, pad woon sen, and black bean scallop. \n\nWe've ordered the silver noodle soup to go a few times and each time it was mostly broth so we don't bother doing that any more."
"I mean seriously?!?!?\nThis food is so perfect! The price, the quantity and well..... Locations could be better but I get it.... It's a demographic thing. \nCarne asada tacos are super. \nGo there.The end."
"Honestly, second favorite burger in all of charlotte area. \n\nFirst favorite is Zacks, as it will always hold a place in my heart. But Mr. K's is the mistress. And a damn beautiful one at that. \n\n\nThere's just something so breathtaking about the way a single establishment can stay successful even when there is a Chipotle right beside it, and a Bar in front of it. \n\nAnd let's not forget the Double Big K cheeseburger, with a side of cheese fries and a good ass banana blueberry milkshake. We all know why you came here. And it's calling your name. So do like I did, and follow the sounds of your stomach over to Mr. K's on South BLVD."
"At first I was a little concerned about the location. But the restaurant was very clean both in & out, had a fun atmosphere & was a gem of a find through Groupon \n\nThe table side guac is super delicious.  And Aaron makes a helluva margarita. The service was outstanding & extremely personable at all levels."
I used to go to this place with an ex-boyfriend who lived in Charlotte and I miss it so much! I'm amazed no one has mentioned the Penguin Fingers... They are the best chicken fingers ever! The hush puppies are to die for... I just wish this place had more seating...
Can I just say I absolutely love this place!  I was actually a waitress here back in 2005. I left because I moved back to los Angeles California and yet I have not found a place that is as good as kabutos. They have benihanas out here yet still not up to kabutos level. I would really love to see a kabutos out here! I think I might just take a flight to north Carolina to have some kabutos.  Great owners and staff. Try the shrimp sauce on your rice. The best!!
"The best car wash I've found in town.  Granted, this isn't saying all that much, but for the price you pay, it is a significant upgrade to Terrible Herbst's.  I've tried the Green Valley and Seven Hills car washes and I will drive across town for this one.  It does look a bit run down, but judge it by the quality of work."
"It may look shabby from the outside, but inside is some of the best Dim Sum I've had in the Charlotte area - at the Dragon Court Restaurant. The staff is very acommodating and patient with those of us who have questions. Also don't miss the Banh Mi at the Vietnamese sandwich shop inside the mall. (Forget the $5 footlong at Subway...get one twice as good for half the price here!)\n\nI agree with Tony that the parking lot could use some serious work. It's like the surface of the moon! However, I've never been panhandled there, except for one time a guy asked to bum a cigarette. No worries here about security during the day, but I would be cautious after dark, like in any city this size."
"The largest imitation floral shop in Nevada I think. Very unique place. Many local celebs have been going there for years to deck-out their weird Vegas homes. Its a silk flower super store. They have everything from fake trees, to fake single stems of flowers. I have shopped there for twelve years so far. They are wholesalers to most interior designers around town. They sell fake plants/flowers, not real. Also have the best/cheapest selection of pottery and unusual decor items too. Their pottery is mostly sandstone, which requires a plastic under-liner or dish for real plants."
"This is one of those special bookstores staffed by real live writers and that fact, rather than membership in any particular trade or professional association, is what lends a bookstore credibility."
"You will be pleasantly surprised at the wonderful service from the return call to the end of your appointment. \nI had a horrible time figuring out what was wrong and Steve came over and he knew what to look for and where to go and low and behold our issue was fixed. \nGreat customer service with a highly experienced professional is something that is hard to find here in Vegas but Deke's has it all.\nCall now and you will not be sorry, I promise!\nThank you Steve and Jenny!\nI am relieved that that my house is not broken :)"
"Painkiller. Go. Drink it. It will fix what ails you.\n\nGreat cocktail menu. I have yet to eat here, but the drinks are great. Patio outside is neat as well. Perfect place to go to when you want to forget you're in central Wisconsin for a few hours."
"It is pricey but worth the money! I went with the 4 course meal and I left super satisfied. A note to any jews or muslims, they cook with wine so it may not be an option for yous."
As usual I had very good service at the Starbucks this time. Actually a little better due to the fact that their system is down they were giving everybody free drinks because they could not charge them for a drink.
"Fixed my locks, was on time and reasonably priced. I was pleased with the service and the tech did not try to sell me on unnecessary extras."
Nice flowers at a decent price!  Not sure how they can sell dozen roses for $10.
"I came here last night with Donald for Taco Tuesday ($1.50 fish tacos after 2pm). There were quite a bit of people dining inside since they had the special going on, but there wasn't any line at all, so we got our food right away. We ordered 3 fish tacos each, which was more than enough since they were pretty big, and a small fountain drink for only $12.26. Now that was a cheap dinner! The fish was cooked well and the cabbage was fresh. The only thing I didn't really like was the corn tortillas because they were pretty thick and broke easily, but that wasn't a big deal. i just wish there was a Rubios closer to my side of town!"
"I've been a local to this spot for several years now and I've also recently started making reviews. I actually ordered this for delivery and it usually takes 30-45 minutes. The location is a little bit meh, but the food and taste will definitely hit the spot. The price is fair for the portions they serve. The wait is a little long, but your mouth will water once your number is called."
"UBS is key to college survival; they pretty much have everything you would need in the way of textbooks, school/office supplies, badger gear, and probably stuff you didn't know you needed but upon sight, know that it should be yours.\n\nSome textbooks can be found for cheaper at other local places, and of course online shopping is always cheaper, but UBS typically has course lists of materials which you can have sent to you, put on reserve in store, or simply show up and grab what you need.\n\nI've always found the staff to be really helpful during the rush at the start of the semester, which makes everyone's lives a lot easier.\n\nLocated in Library Mall, UBS is definitely convenient, and is great to shop for gifts for anyone really. \n\nThe prices aren't as low as they could be, but that is to be expected by a local store who pretty much owns the college population."
"What can I say about this place? The crowd was very friendly, they had a good jukebox, there was karaoke and pool tables. Did I mention that it's open 24 hours? It's one of the older bars in Vegas and that is highly appealing in the era of floofy cocktail bars. It was dark, dirty and reeked of yesteryear. We bopped in to have one drink and ended up staying all night. We witnessed a biker and a mexican fighting and rolling like a tumbleweed across the floor - four stars."
"Excellent experience!!!  Thad and Polly took great care of me!  I set up my appointment and ordered my tires, oil change and new wipers online.  What I didn't realize is that I ordered the wrong tires, Thad let me know right away and had the tires I needed in stock so it was no big deal, except for my ego, I felt like a moron.  I was there approximately 1.5-2 hours and had new tires, oil change, new wipers, and an alignment.  Excellent customer care!!!  I would highly recommend!"
"48 hours before they were to close their doors after 60 years, a long time patron has purchased MCs!\n\nThey will be shutting down for a couple of weeks for a much needed redo, but he will be back in business before the end of June 2011.  : )\n\nLavender Blue Dilly Dilly lives on!!!"
"If you want good authentic Chinese food at very reasonable prices, look no further.  Is this place shiny and fancy?  No, but I've been to many a hole in the wall where they serve terrific food.  This place is no exception.\n\nI don't know if I've had a bad dish here.  The selection is large if you know what to order.  Many items are not on the American menu.  The live seafood is awesome and it is cooked to perfection however way you please.  We have also ordered a whole roasted sucking pig here on several occasions for the holidays."
Sometimes I just walk in here for no apparent reason. The store just calls to me and says I have something you want. The product quality is good and if you ever have any problems there is no hassle with returns. The prices are good and there are always coupons in the mail. \n\nOne of my favorite sections in this store is the checkout counter with all its neat little gadgets and bag fillers. So many fun things I never knew I needed lol. \n\nConvenient location with a lot of parking and other attractive stores. I can't skip this place whenever i stop by the Best in the West shopping center.
Great Restaurant. My friend had his wedding reception in the garden area out back. The food is the bomb. It's a nice euro style cafe that has a chef that knows what he's good at and delivers. Small tables but never crowded and a polite staff. It's a shame there aren't more like this in the burgh. I've been there 3-4 times and it's always a pleasure. \nThe owner/chef has everything under control and exudes confidence in what he has created. And he should the place rocks. \n\nMy only complaint is it can get a little smokey if there busy. They should take some cash and invest in a better air vent for the cooking area. I hate smelling like I just left working in a kitchen. \n\nMake a reservation because it's not easy to get in on weekends. And bring cash. No Credit.
All I can even say is Dr. Askew is gentle and I was seen right at the time of my appointment with out having to wait like most offices. \nI left feeling relieved and wondering why I was so nervous in the first place.
"Lets be clear, this is a DIVE Bar.  It's small, low lit, the prices are cheap, the drinks are strong, the burgers are big, and the people are friendly.  If you are looking for a place to relax after work and get something good to eat, this is the place.  The Bacon Cheeseburger is actually smothered with real bacon (and only $5), and they offer fresh homemade onion rings.  Thursday mornings they offer the $2 special - 2 eggs, toast, bacon, and hash browns.  Don't go here if you are expecting a high-end bar or college hangout, it's a working man's (or woman's) bar.   \n\nP.S.  They offer Smut and Eggs on the weekends, so I would avoid bringing the children."
"So I went back and I don't like it quite as much. It's still good, but not as good. I think they might have stopped serving their lentil side dish with every meal, which makes me sad, cause that was yummy. It's a little bland-er than I remember, but still a cute place with good food."
"Not much more to say about the place, it's great!  Only problem is that you can spend a lot of money here really fast because they carry so much cool random stuff."
"""Diamonds has awesome traditional cantonese food that I cannot find anywhere else locally.  Great portions, cheap price, amazing flavors!  For years I couldnt figure out what the special flavor in the lo mein was..simply awesome!  Finally took my \""""asian chef\"""" pal and realized it was an extremely hot wok that they were cooking in, giving a smoky flavor to my \""""fried\"""" noodles...go figure!\n\n\nNow that bad...this place is not for the faint of heart...it smells and is old and has the occasional cock roach you'll see...but its very real chinese food so its all good!  \n\nJust dont look at the geoduck in the fish tanks...if youve been there, you know what I mean - LOL!  If you have not been there...google geoduck, again - LOL!\n\nI love this place..."""
"So I played all three of the Summerlin city golf courses and already left a review on the other 2. This course was a good experience for me and it was all because of the customer service. This course has no drinking water anywhere on the course and of course i never saw a marshall anywhere giving water but thankfully the proshop guy gave me 2 waters before i went out and made sure the cart guy put an ice chest in my cart to keep them cold. The other 2 courses didn't give a rats ass about me out in 110 degree heat without any water. There weren't really any people on the course so that part was nice. The conditions were fine, decent greens, decent fairways (a lot of unfilled divots though), good t boxes, pretty terrible sand...but no biggie. \nWould i suggest people to play here? sure, it's cheap and fun, but with the experience i had at the other 2 courses, i would like nothing more than for this whole chain to go bankrupt."
"I have heard that it takes great bread to make an excellent sandwich. With places like this around Pittsburgh there is no reason for Subway visits for this guy. Subway has $5 footlongs well this joint has $5 dollar square foot subs. I swear this is one of the largest and tastiest sandwiches I have had from a deli. I felt like I was playing where's waldo upon entering this small supermarket because it was packed with food and people. I really enjoyed the roasted peppers that they put on this sandwich. There is no room in here to eat so to complete the experience I pulled up a milk crate out front and ate my lunch there. You have to come and try a sandwich here I think you will be happy with something about it, if not the huge size, than the experience alone is worth the $5 dollars."
"Very very good. Me and my group of 3 got two 20 inch subs. One was sausage and the other was the Italian. I preferred the sausage but both were very good.  I picked them up and then walked back to my hotel, so they werent piping hot, but that is hardly their fault. The staff was friendly my group got there right before they closed and they still made our food and didnt make you feel bad about it. I would have liked to tried the meatball sub, but they were out of meatballs. There are a few other things i would have liked to try but i live out of state."
"Chicken and waffles, hot sauce, red beans and rice and a huge Iced tea. I cant eat like this all the time, but when I do, I'm going to Lo-Lo's. \n\nMy friend took me there before a Suns game and wow, what a great way to start the evening. I had 3 pieces of chicken and 1 waffle. My friend doubled that and he added the LARGEST GLASS OF RED KOOLAID I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!! \n\nIt was a classy move....good show ole bean... \n\nAnyways, check it out, its badass.."
"""You know the part in Showgirls when Nomi Malone pronounces Versace \""""Ver-sais\""""? This hotel will give you the opportunity to feel just like that, only without any of the mockery, nudity, or Kyle MacLachlan's potato-head. \n\nGreat hotel, phenomenal lobby, accommodating staff, good food, near transportation and walking distance from an awesome Turkish restaurant. There was a women's college soccer team giggling and roaming around the hotel in uniform while I was there. Really, you don't need much more than that. Pittsburgh rules."""
"It seems this is the spot if you are looking for home decor as the majority of the store is furniture, decorations, paintings, lamps, etc. Some of it is overpriced for used, but some were actually a good price. I saw some cool accent chairs and comfy looking recliners for $50.  \n\nThis thrift store also has a solid selection of books! Lots of good titles and paper backs were 75cents and hardbacks were $1.50 which is much lower than almost all the other thrift shops. \n\nI was looking for decor, vases, bottles and the like for my wedding and I unfortunately striked out on that aspect, but the quality of stuff to dig through is there so I definitely will be returning."
"Upon moving to Charlotte 3 years ago, we brought our 12 year old Shepard/Chow Stella for medical care and boarding. Although we saw a several different vets over our time, we were always pleased with the care our girl received. Unfortunately, we had to let her go this year. When the time came, Dr. Yasin and the staff were very kind and supportive and made our difficult time as easy as it could be. If you are looking for caring folks that can provide support in all phases of your pet's life, give Long a try."
"Brixx is good - not really a super huge fan of the thin crust thing, but I can justify stuffing my face with an entire pizza. It somehow seems...healthier*. \n\nDeadly combination: super cheap draft beer on Monday nights. Price of a soda cheap. \n\nI hadn't been inside since the remodel and it's a huge improvement. Servers are attentive and quick. \n\nThe jerk chicken = love. \n\nOverall = delicious.\n\n* feel free to ask my waist line how I feel about this in a month or so."
"Had everything I wanted, but the service is described as SLOW! 4 employees standing around and only one cash register was open! I can only imagine the quality of service during the holiday season!"
"I was going to eat half my order and save the rest for later but that didn't happen. I found myself eyeing my other diner's plates. The food is amazing. The chicken was tender and delicious. I tried each of the sauces and they were all delicious. Our favorite was the mixed (not hot, not mild). We had NO leftovers."
Mike W. As a life resident of Pittsburgh I grew up eating South Side pretzels outside of Mt. Oliver pool being sold out of a wicker basket.Now I can not go thru South Side without stoping.Not only did I bring my kids there I now enjoy brining my grandson.The pretzel Shop is a must visit frequently.8
"If you're looking for decent Pho at a place that's consistent this is the place for you. I Always get the white chicken Pho with spring rolls or the fried rolls. I'm sure they use MSG, but haven't found a place yet that doesn't. Good overall and close to the strip for you tourists."
"I'd have to say this place wasn't bad at all. \n\nPros:\n* nice lobby\n* staff we encountered were friendly\n* mini starbucks on the first floor\n* clean room, comfortable beds, nice bathroom\n* relatively strong and free wifi\n* flat panel TVs with a few HD channels\nCons:\n* nothing special restaurant wise"
"Thanks Yelp for reminding me that I added a photo for Cabo forever ago and need to get my butt in gear with writing a review! \n\nI went here quite a few times my time in Charlotte and always enjoyed it. You got superb people watching, cold beers, a decent patio area (albeit more mosquitoes than I care to have around me at one time) and reliable food. As for the inside, I have no clue about it and really don't remember it that much. Hmmmm....that can't be a good sign. But I blame it either on beer or the fact that I always sat outside (even in the fall, again, big hmmmm). The first thing I ever ordered there was the BBQ Mahi Tacos and I never strayed from it because I loved it so much. But I think more of that was due to the tortillas than anything, you could put an old dirty show in one of their tortillas and I would eat because I'm nasty like that. And now I'm in FL craving Cabo, anyone want to overnight it? Thanks!"
"Having just moved here, I had a lot of home improvement needs, and Home Depot has been a reliable source. Although the prices at Lowe's are sometimes better (sometimes not), I've found the employees at Home Depot to be much more helpful and knowledgeable."
"Honest and fair. I tried a wide array of mechanics around town and as soon as I took my car here, I have stuck with the place ever since and have never been disappointed."
"Ok - this place is what it is.  It's a hotel/casino version of the restaurant chain. It's low class, it trends just toward the wrong side of red neck (although if you're looking for your fill of mullets this is your place!) and it's a lot of fun. They don't try to pretend to be anything they're not. And that's what makes this place perfect.\n\nThe casino is tiny. The limits are very low. The dealers (generally) are a lot of fun. The cocktail waitresses are always on their game - I don't think I've ever gone more than 20 minutes in this place without being offered a(nother) drink. The rooms are cheap and clean - not overly comfortable, but when you're collapsing into bed at 4a (or later) who really cares?\n\nWhen it's a boys trip to Vegas we always stay here. And even if we're staying somewhere else, chances are we're spending the bulk of our time here."
I really liked Kiva Han as it was my concentration hideout for a couple of years.. the food and drinks quality are way better than what is being offered in the craig street area.. the staff there are friendly..and most importantly it opens till LATE. I'm taking one star off due to the slowness in preparing the food + the tables aren't always clean.
I had a pretty good chicken sandwich and the waffle fries were tasty too!\n\nThe kids got fun toys in their meals. My brother-in-law got some grilled chicken that looked pretty pathetic and he said it didn't taste good either.\n\nOverall it was a good experience and the place seemed pretty clean which I appreciate that!!
Friendly staff. Clean rooms. I'd stay again. Much better than sleeping on a dorm room floor.
"I use to work here. I love the products they sell, so with that being said even though I don't work there anymore I still shop here. You won't find better quality cleaning supplies in the valley. And all their staff is trained to sell you the right product you need to get your cleaning done right."
I find it inconceivable that anyone could give this eatery anything less than a 5-star review. It's a phenomenal place to eat eggs and potatoes and drink coffee. It's all I want in a restaurant.
The french toast with roasted hazelnuts is delicious! A shame it's not served with pure maple syrup.
The most authentic mexican food around.  The carne asada is amazing and their guacamole is always fresh.  I do feel completely gross and unhealthy after leaving but that's why Los Tacos is an occasional treat.\n \nThe staff is bilingual so you don't have to speak spanish to order with confidence like some places around town.. *cough* Robertos *cough*.\n \nLove this place!
"""Now this is a doughnut shop!  So many to choose from that I could have ordered 100 of them.  After a disappointing trip to Dunkin' Donuts the other day, got a box of mixed varieties (jelly filled, frosted with sprinkles, orange glazed, boston creme and more...) for $7.50.  The person running the place was very friendly.  Even though it's in downtown, I'd rather drive the 15 or so miles from Centennial Hills than the 2 minutes to Dunkin' \""""Donuts\""""."""
"I really love trader joe's! I am giving them 4 stars and not 5 for this location because of the size of the store, and its hit and miss depending on what time and day you go.... Employees are constantly stocking the shelves, but sometimes you can't get what it is you are looking for.\nI love the quality of their organic products, and the prices are fabulous!! Especially compared to Whole foods prices.\nAnother thing I love about Trader Joe's... their fresh flowers... so beautiful and look beautiful for a week or more!\nQuality and Price!!!\nYay!!!"
"Generally speaking, the service is good -- I've had some bad ones.  The food is pretty good, but the reason to go is for the brunch.  It can get crowded, but worth the wait.  They make their desserts on site, and make omlettes and waffles while you wait.  The meats can be overcooked, but it's still all quite tasty."
"As we were excited that we adopted our dog Mister from the animal shelter, this animal hospital was close to our house. When they said he was healthy and had no problems,  we were surprised to hear that wasn't the case. As we were upset with all the problems Mister had,  they have been very nice and caring toward all his needs. We are happy we brought Mister home and very happy with the way this hospital has been taking care of our dog. Thanks for everything guys!"
"Yeah its a chain, but it has an independently owned quality to it.  Friendly staff."
"I called Colburn Enterprises over 10 years ago to install a water softner for me.  Since then, I have been a loyal customer and have never ONCE thought I was over charged or taken advantage of.  They provide quality plumbing services and always leave the area they are working on in a very clean order.  I appreciate the honesty and top notch workmenship that Colburn has always provided.  If you need a plumber, this is a great choice."
I like Gennaros. Standard pizza hole in the wall kind of place. They're never busy and the staff is always grumpy but the pizza taste good so I keep going back. Prices are middle of the road and the same as pizza Sola and sals. If your looking for a local pizza place that serves decent food go here.
"Im a believer, no offering required. I had Jersey Mike's  Original Italian. Great flavor good size. I have not tried any hot subs yet but my guess is cold subs is their specialty. If you eat a giant sub be prepared to dvr all the sports games and reality shows you lie about not watching."
"Ok , I finally made it out to Squirrel Hill , I had to pay Mineo's a visit. \nMan , I missed This Pizza !\n It is still one of my all time favorites. I ordered a large cheese pizza to go , and they told me 20 min. Well after 45 min , My Pie was finally done. Seems like a really long time to make a pizza , but honestly , after getting home and taking my first bite , all was forgiven.\nI did get to see a few other places on Murray & Forbes that I gotta try soon. \nI wanted to go to Jerry's records & a electronic repair shop , but they were closed at 8:00. Maybe next time I order a Pizza from Mineos , I'll use the 45 min. to buy some old records. ( If I can find my old record player.)"
"""This is the perfect spot for brunch if you are looking for a standard, greasy spoon type diner. The food was good, there was a lot of it, and it was incredibly inexpensive. Another reviewer said try to order straight off the menu because they will not accommodate you, but I will say the exact opposite of this. I was with three family members who all wanted their food made very precisely, and the waitress was super nice and understanding and the food was made exactly as requested. We also had a child with us who wanted something not on the menu and the waitress said, \""""just tell us what you want, we'll figure out a way to make it.\"""" Ok, it sounds like we were an awful table but I don't think it was that bad lol. Anyway, GREAT place!"""
"You really can't go wrong here. The food itself isn't so outstanding, but the buffet style makes up for it. I always eat too much, but I don't feel TOO guilty, since it's mostly veggies I'm eating. The pizzas are alright as well, and who can resist pizza with a side of ranch for dipping? I also am a great fan of soft serve, so the ice cream bar is a nice touch.\n\nIt's a great place for families, and especially families with kids, as there's a lot of options to satisfy picky eaters and adventurous gourmands alike."
"Every major city needs a community center like this for the LGBQT population: whether or not you utilize the services or are part of the community it's intended to help, it's an asset to the area. And not just for the free condoms.\n\nExterior d\u00e9cor is modern and interior is welcoming and comfortable, like a bookstore or library- the main lobby area actually IS part library, complete with a bank of computers for internet access and personal use, and the Bronze Caf\u00e9.\n\nFront desk is staffed by friendly peeps who don't mind pointing out the different services offered here and the information pamphlets available. What's especially valuable is the television-screen daily information page showing all of the events and services taking place at the center that day, on a loop with ads and info for local support groups and relevant community statistics. \n\nBonus points: look over the TV screen at the main desk at all of the local businesses and major companies that contributed to and supported the founding of this center and continue to support it's ongoing role in the community."
"Reupholstering your sofa? Need to freshen up your outdoor cushions?  H&R has everything.  \n\nI just looked this place up again cause I need some upholstery fabric.  Five years ago we reupholstered most of the stuff in our house, and we really price shopped then.  H&R had the selection and a good price.\n\nThis year I bought some chaises on Craigslist but the cushions were sunfaded.  H&R not only has tons of Sunbrella fabric, they have tons of Sunbrella remnants and discontinued colors - much cheaper.  Excellent.\n\nAnyway - off to H&R!"
"They ran out of their combo glassware and I was really looking forward to getting one with my chicken wrap combo!  Regardless, I appreciate the history behind this hole-in-the wall joint and even with the management change, I think the crowd of people waiting for a seat speak for itself.\n\nThe food was greasy and delicious, just as I remembered it from my previous visits years ago.  Kids running galore and a full house definitely brings a family vibe to the place. \n\nPenguin, you are one star away from perfection.  Clean up the place a little bit and give my my combo mug- then you'd be perfect."
"Everyone I talked with was friendly and helpful. The wait was short. The care was kind and caring. The process was easy. The parking lot was pretty full so make sure to leave enough time to possibly wait for a spot. Lovely facility.\n\n*note for OB/GYN care at this facility: midwives are not allowed. I hear this is not the place to go for a natural childbirth. Although as far as OB/GYNs go, I've found one of the kindest physicians I can imagine here."
"Still wonderful, but just a tip -- you can't put tips on a credit card, so be sure to bring cash or a check."
"""We love donuts, and yes, we would marry them if we could. My family is vegan and have abstained from the sweet treat for six years because we suck at homemade donuts(thats another story). When we heard about this place, we flatlined. Not only are they serving Vegan-friendly donuts, they also happen to be a headquarters for deliciousness. The cream-filled donuts are positively decadent! We recently created a \""""birthday cake\"""" with a one dozen variety for a special someone's special day. Better than traditional birthday cake. I'll post a pic :) Don't miss this place if you are in town, vegan or not, you will be an instant addict..."""
"Baked Brie. It was amazing. Yes, I said amazing which is not a word I'm a fan of because I think it is kind of ordinary but it really was. I have never had brie that was so good. It came with these great home-made crackers. I think I've only had crackers out of a Nabisco box. Freaking awesome.\n\nWe also started with the calamari which was good and I believe the bread was fantastic too.\n\nThis review is of course written much later than it should have been so I can't remember everything that clearly.\n\nOur entrees were great as was the dessert. I got the Coconut Cream Cake which was from a local bakery. Delicious. The waitress was awesome and said that if I didn't like it, she'd just get me something else. She didn't have the chance to because I ate it so fast!\n\nI want to mention the waitress again. She was very sweet and I felt almost like I was in someone's home which was a nice feeling.\n\nI recommend this place but you must promise to order the Brie. Be careful because they mean it when they say the plate is hot!"
"As good as it gets outside of Cambodia or Midtown Manhattan.  a gem for Pittsburgh.\n\nThese folks used to own Phnom Penh downtown.  I have yet to taste a better Pad Thai.  \n\nTheir red and green curry is to die for.  \n\nThis isn't your corner chinese place, folks, be very careful when ordering the spiciness.  I usually go for an eight at local places.  But this place is authentic, and has authentic cooks.  A seven in the curry made me sweat and tear up.  But oh, so good!\n\nTake-out is prompt, and the place is busy at times, but after seven you have the place to yourself."
"I was here one night for a couple hours without a single person in the place except the bartender who seemed to be confused about why I would be in there to begin with.  He looked as if I was about to rob the joint when I walked in.  If you're looking for a b.s.-free dive in Vegas for a beer & whiskey, don't go here because I prefer to have it empty for myself.  Stay away."
"I would definitely go here again.  \n\nI am not a fan of the website, and booking the apt prior to arriving but they were very helpful when you call the number.  It was very easy to explain what I was looking for and get an appointment the next day.  My husband and I got  couples message and he had a foot scrub at the end of his.  This was a fantastic experience.  \n\nFirst, the place was clean and the therapists were very friendly.  I got a 60 min message w/ Rebecca who was amazing. She asked me a few questions at the beginning and was dead on with the whole message.  My husband also got a message, he didn't catch his woman's name but he said it was amazing too. \n\nThe prices are very good too! Definitely not what you'd expect for a Vegas place. I'll definitely be going here again."
"The food is plentiful and the atmosphere is shabby chic thailand.  A little pricey for the decor but not for the neighborhood as it's tucked in Dilworth on East Blvd.  All in all, a good place to get a large sized portion of Thai food."
"Not from the area. We found this place from Yelp. When we were in parking lot we were kinna wondering if this was really Vietnamese restaurant. Looks like hole in the wall. Food was amazing. Big portion and the servuce was very good. Next time I visit, for sure I'll be here again.   Bun Bo Hue I ordered was good but it tasted a little to much MSG. Still was good tho."
"Rad, chrome and red, amazing prehistoric fish-tanked Oriental dining hall aesthetic. Large lazy susan full to overflowing with condiments (fish sauce! oil based chili that isn't as hot as it looks! etc) and utensils sitting in the middle of your table. \n\nDecent selection of tofu entrees and apps, but the veggie pho is where it's at. Ever since our Viet-training-wheel event, I've been \nsemi-obsessed with vegetarian pho and have had it at a number of queen city mainstays - but Saigon's is best, has all the correct additions, and is almost the cheapest. So that's awesome.\n\nOther than that, the menu is ok but less extravagant than BT's or LV's. Those guys set a high bar, and there it is. But as they do not have a vegetarian pho option, I will drive out here to order Saigon's. Happily."
"Small, but had the basics with good quality"
"Oh Gooski's.  How I love you.  I am married to the Park House, but I would cheat on it with you more often if only you weren't in Polish Hill.  I love your rank smoky dive-bar stench, your incredibly strong mixed drinks at garage-sale prices, your penchant for punk rock... You might be the best dive bar in the history of the universe."
"""I have been with Pair Networks since 2002 and there is a reason for that, they are great at what they do. \n\nCorrespondence with the Pair team is quick (receive a response typically within 30min to an hour with the support team - sometimes even less) and usually within one email everything I need is addressed entirely. Their staff are also friendly, professional and knowledgeable which is helpful when you have to talk with them (have dealt with other hosting companies and the customer service was lacking). \n\nOut of the time I have been with Pair, I have only had my website down \""""ONCE\"""" due to server problems in March 2012 (which they helped me with by transferring me to a new server). \n\nThough the price you pay for hosting is a bit on the pricey side, you sometimes get what you pay for and what I am getting is worth every penny! As long as Pair keeps doing what they are doing, I will be with them for life!"""
"Ahh Dino's...If you can't win at Dino's, Don't play!\n\nThe other reviews pretty much sum it up.  Cheap drinks ($2.50 beers that increase to $3 during karaoke), fun karaoke and great people watching.  Oh and you're also right across the street from the OG so if Dino's isn't cutting the mustard you can run across the street for your pole dance fix.\n\nIf you are into the karaoke on the weekends be sure to show up around 10, it get's pretty crowded and unless you get your ticket in soon, and tip Danny G, you'll be waiting a while to get on stage.  The play list is extensive and carries some tunes I've never seen at other bars.  Some of the talent here is fabulous.\n\nUgh, hack, it's hella smokey in this place."
Sure - it looks like its better days are behind it.  But the work is great!\n\nThey care a lot and spend quite a bit of time getting it right.  I am quite particular.  \n\nEverything gets wiped down.  It's the third time I've been here. \n\nI'll definitely be back.
"You lucky SOBs... If the Blue Moon was in my hometown they would great me by name when I strolled in. \n\nThe other reviewers are spot on great burgers, nice beer selection, drinks are heavy pours, and the service is efficient and friendly.. Oh and the prices are more than reasonable... My client said that the Friday fish diners are awesome...\n\n I stopped by with a colleague for a nightcap and we were quickly wishing we went here for dinner... So we decided to stop by for lunch the following day...\n\nMy pepper jack cheeseburger with fried onions was cooked perfectly Med. Fries were old style and not greasy at all. Our server made sure our ice teas were always topped. Checking out the piles of food being delivered to other diners and the empty plates being returned confirmed that the Moon has got it going on..  A definite return visit when I return in May...."
This is Vegas. Nothing else is more Vegas than this mainstay. It has been here for years and if you have not been here then you are missing out. Nothing here is bad. The lines get a little crazy on the weekends in summer but that is a good sign. Stop procrastinating and get your butt down to this Vegas classic.
"I wanted a spa day for my birthday and didn't want to pay at the overpriced casino spas. I had read positive reviews on Yelp, and I was not disappointed. I did a 3-part package: facial, wrap, and massage - for $180. I've only had 2 or 3 facials before and had never done a wrap. All were fantastic, and I actually fell asleep during the massage because I was so relaxed. The therapists, whose names I've totally forgotten (sorry!) were fantastic and super friendly. Very patient with a million questions about the wrap and a concern given previous facials. I went on a Monday and got an additional discount. (Not sure if that was a special or a regular thing.)\nMy own wish is that it felt a little less like a standard massage place/dr's office and a little bit more like a day spa. There's a spot to sit and overlook the lake, but it was a little chilly.\nI definitely recommend this place and look forward to going back in a few months."
Great local beer i love that they have redoak on draft. The chicken ceasar salad has a unique taste and the chicken fried steak is normaly good. Only one time did i get a bad waitress and she just kind of ruined the night but the food is not to blame. Not authentic cajun but all and all good tasting food
"This was a really good experience. Despite the fact that it kinda smelled like cigarettes, we (me, gf, kids) had a nice lunch. \n\nThe prices are insanely cheap for what you get. The kids meals, bean burritos with beans and rice, were only four bucks, and they couldn't finish them. The adults got avocado tostada and veggie burrito. She couldn't finish hers. I finished the burrito but I never give up (when it comes to eating).\n\nIf this place weren't three states away I bet it would be a regular spot for dinner. Next time I'm in East Suburban Charlotte I'll probably come back."
"For the cool, trendy crowd and the weird crowd, which is cool too! Ugly Christmas sweaters anyone?\n\nYou don't go to Ragstock to pick up your staple white socks. You go for the experience! There's nothing like shuffling through and finding hidden gems for way cheaper than a chain biz. Fleece lined leggings...comfy.\n\nReserve some time in your day to come down here and get your nose in some stellar deals. You won't have to worry about running into your co-worker with the same cardigan!\n\nThere's an outfit for EVERY personality.\n\nQuality is hit or miss, but you can't beat the deals."
"I like Ronald's because they are one of few places that does anything vegan. I'm not a vegan - but I am lactose intolerant. So this is great! I will say, though, in the end, a donut is a donut is a donut. These are just vegan, and buying them is cheap and supports local business. This is good."
"Came here due to the 4.5 star ratings on yelp and ordered 3 combos to go. The inside is plain as a small asian restaurant should be (you won't get that unless you're asian sorry). The staff were very courteous and gave us complimentary peanuts and tea as we waited for our orders. They even came around to check on us and refill our drinks (remember we're a to-go order there really is no obligation to serve us).\n\nThe food was good. Meat jun was eggy and delicious, the meat was pretty tender and flavorful, and the kimchi was strong and funky. There was plenty of rice and for the price and location this was a good cheap lunch. I'd definitely recommend this place for those who are looking for a relatively inexpensive lunch option."
"My father recently passed away and a family member wanted to send a sort of tranquility garden as opposed to traditional cut flowers.  Stephanie put together a beautiful, lush arrangement that was perfect and had it ready immediately.  I called her again this morning and asked her to do a Christmas centerpiece that was more outdoorsy and rustic as opposed to fussy and embellished.  Not only is it beautiful, but when I asked if it could be delivered this afternoon, she said if the truck wasn't back she'd deliver it herself.  It was there by the afternoon.  And she worked to make sure everything was within my price range!  I will continue to use this florist and highly recommend them!!"
"Unlike the Costcos I've been to in the Bay Area, this Costco sells Mexican Coke, Jarritos, and Sangr\u00eda Se\u00f1orial by the case.\n\nThe friendly folks at the cash registers also offer to help you pack your goodies into boxes for ease of transport.\n\nPlus, a gas station for your drive to SoCal.. or wherever home is."
"I absolutely love Kabob Grill. Their chicken is fresh and juicy. I was a little intimated by the amount of rice they give with their kabob plates, but the rice is SO good, you won't be able to stop eating it. \n\nThey are also super fast. I called, placed my order and they said my food would be ready in 15 minutes. I came 5 minutes earlier and my food was handed to me immediately. \n\nMy plate came with a side, so I asked for hummus. I don't know if it was a goof up, but the hummus did not come with pita.  Make sure you ask for pita with the hummus. \n\nI definitely recommend this place if you're looking for fast, healthy Mediterranean food."
I would rather go here for coffee over Starbucks. \nTry the coconut latte.. :) yum
"From its exterior, the bakery looks like just another old-fashioned neighborhood store, but first impressions can be deceiving. Despite its dowdy appearance, Jean-Marc Chatellier's is a kick-ass bakery, possibly the only proper patisserie in Pittsburgh.\n\nThey make well-proportioned croissants that are pure buttery goodness. The exterior is flaky, and the inside is soft and airy, not too bread-y. In addition to the traditional plain, they also offer ones stuffed with apples, cherries, raisins, or chocolate. I was also impressed by their variety of pastries. The apple strudel was awesome. Of the brioches, I liked the ones with the almond paste the best.  \n\nThe one drawback: the shop is difficult to get to without a car, and the good stuff may be sold out already if you show up in the afternoon. \n\n4.5 stars"
"This place is great.  I showed up, without a reservation, looking for a very specific bike.  They had one and started to prep it for me.  Unfortunately, they found some mechanical issues with the bike, and rather than have me waiting around, they upgraded me for free.  I will definitely use them the next time I'm in Vegas and will recommend them to my friends."
"After paying a little too much for valet parking, my second favourite ginger and I (I put myself first), messily dragged our weekend bags behind us through the revolving doors into this hotel. \n\nHello, Gorgeous! \n\nHuge white marble arches, columns and gold touches decorated to the nines for Christmas. This might sound gaudy, but this place is all class. Fancy like Reba circa 1992. Divine like Bette Midler circa always. \n\nThe rooms are beautiful with all the extras you would expect, including starchy white robes, movies and 24 hour room service. We didn't have much of a view, but who cares, we had a king size bed and a bubble bath. \n\nPEPPER POINTS to hotwire.com for getting us a cheap deal at this glorious abode. It'd a bit too rich for my blood without the deal."
"Those who know me know how much I love bread (I've been known to eat a whole plain baguette as a snack!), and, as a result, what a bread snob I can be. I guess growing up in France does that to you...\n\nOne of my coworkers recommended Mirabelle, claiming that their bread and croissants are the best she's had outside of France... Needless to say I did not believe her, but I decided to check it out nonetheless. \n\nThe verdict: their baked goods are pretty damn good! I got a baguette and a couple of croissants, and was very pleasantly surprised. The croissants were great (and I wolfed them down in no time), and the baguette was very decent. My only complaints (hence the missing star): their selection is fairly limited, and the prices are a bit steep ($2.25 for a baguette, same for a croissant... when I'm used to paying no more than a dollar in France). But I suppose I really can't complain, and I'll definitely be back."
"After dealing with a disaster from a 1-800 Flowers store, I went to The Blossom Shop and they were great! The flowers were top quality, and the service was what you should expect. I will definitely use them every time now!"
"Although I didn't try the grilled stuff as it was lunch and I didn't want to need a nap in the afternoon.. I did love my sandwich! \n\nService was friendly although spotty if that makes sense. No complaints/raves here. Atmosphere is non-existant.. \n\nSandwiches were reasonably priced and very tasty ($8ish). I had the steak rancho.. steak with red sauce and cheese.. mmmm. Fries were just ok. Fiance had  the cuban and enjoyed his as well. Portion sizes were generous, we both had trouble finishing our sandwiches. They are perfect for a big eater. \n\nWe also started the meal with an empanada. This was freaking awesome. Highly recommend trying one ($1.95) while you're there. Beef, chicken, ham and cheese.. you can't go wrong.\n\nFree bread with chimchurri sauce was a diet killer, but a nice surprise from such a value priced casual type joint."
"I went with the idea of trying everything I could and trying not to compare it with Sylvia's in Harlem or any place on New Orleans. Well imagine my surprise when Lolo's in Phoenix, AZ wins BY A HUGE MARGIN!!! \nNo comparison!! Food, quick service, friendliness of staff, and CLEAN! My OCD didn't kick in at all? Don't let the outside appearance or area scare you off. It is beautiful and rustic inside and just an overall great place to eat!!! I WILL be back!"
"I'm hesitant to mention the great hair cuts Yaty gives because I prefer not to wait for an opening. (Appointments recommended.)\nShe's awesome. I had two people mention how cool my hair cut looked. I enjoy the decor of the shop and the local banter. The fee is reasonable ($15) and I appreciate how detailed oriented Yaty is. I look forward to my next visit in about 2 weeks knowing it'll look great, again."
"easy, fast, and cheap"
"I had to try this chicken! It was good! I got the 1/4 white dinner.\nThe wing was ok, but the breast was really good! Not too greasy, not overcooked, seasoned well.\nI picked at the potato rounds, cole slaw and hushpuppies; they were not bad.\n\nI should have brought cash with me, but since there was an ATM inside, I figured it would be ok....BUT...the ATM inside failed for me; it did not read my card. I went to a BofA ATM and came back.\n\nI did not have a long wait since the dinner was already prepared and boxed.\n\nPrice's is worth trying again...just bring cash...don't let the ATM inside fail you as it did for me!"
"So this was my first trip in a long time to the university location mostly due to poor service as of late.  To my surprise it was delicious.  The waitress was polite, helpful, and attentive.  I had the black and blue Caesar salad.  I highly recommend it."
"""A few weeks ago after bowling I ventured to the Bunkhouse with one of my teammates for a quick nightcap.  It was about 9:30 p.m. on a Friday night and it was fairly busy but not packed.  I had not been there in years, literally lived in an apartment complex behind the bar back when I was younger and was definitely a \""""regular\"""" in the day.  \n\nWe only stayed for one cocktail, the bar is kinda divey but a pleasant environment.  The large patio is a nice feature that most bars don't have.  If I still lived in Central Phx and not Tempe I would be there more often."""
"A lot of places claim to be the 'best breakfast in town', so I passed this one too many times. This is perfect home cooking on the run, with fresh bread, farm fresh eggs, and ingredients. It's not the fancy bunch spot with the fancy price tag, but it is affordable real food. Daily soups (3) are also very good. Chowder is very creamy and less clamy."
"Outstanding patient care is given here, everyone is very professional in how they interact with you. Although at times the wait is long I am reminded that this is also for complicated eye diseases, some of the best doctors in Carolina work here, appointments are hard to come by so call way ahead if you can!"
"Nice and knowledgeable guys running this place and a great selection.  If they don't carry what you're looking for, they'll find it and order it for you.  And, if they can't get it through their distributors, they'll tell you where you can find it.  Not very fancy, but a really great place."
"Fun place to go.  Consistent food, friendly service, and cheap prices.  Huge selection as well for a restaurant of this size.\n\nI am hesitant to write reviews of my favorite spots as I fear they will 'blow up,' become too crowded and in turn the quality will go down.  But this place has already been discovered on the internet so I feel there is no harm done.\n\nPlease be polite, quiet, and tip well to keep this place as good as it has been."
"Good store, good service. I'm a bit biased since I live right around the corner, but I still think its a great shop. Very mom n'pop esque, with shelves shoved full of everything you can imagine-- would be very difficult to navigate were it not for the helpful staff who can show you around. Selection isnt quite home depot sized in terms of the multiplicity of brands of the same item, but you can typically find what you need. Hours are good too-- I find myself in the middle of a motorcycle project needing something urgently fairly often and can always find it here."
"Caribou is my preferred coffee chain (yes, I know, chains are evil, but sometimes you like to know what to expect), and this particular store, being within walking distance of my abode, is my most frequently-visited location.  \n\nThe staff is friendly and the coffee is good.  This store is a little smaller than some of its brethren.  This makes it pretty cozy, but also means it can get rather crowded in the evenings and on the weekends.  During peak hours, you might not get one of the comfy leather chairs.  This can be a disappointment if you are wanting to settle in with a cuppa and a novel.  During the afternoons, however, you can usually camp out for an hour or so without annoyance.  There is a distinct group of regulars at this Caribou, and they are an interesting and colorful bunch.\n\nSo yeah, this is my regular haunt for close-to-home coffee, though I have been known to go to the larger facility on North Sardis when I suspect this one might be overflowing with people."
"(from a Pitt Student)\n\nPROS:\nGreat Profs;\nLocated in our hometown (and has several other campuses);\nNot *THE* most expensive tuition (but certainly not the cheapest either);\nGreat campus\nCool buildings (The Cathedral--need i say more?!?);\nlots of cool places to visit around the campus (both food & cultural)\nHillman Library is the best!\nShuttles (Free shuttles to help ya get around campus with your ID)\nThe city is a plus on its own :)\n\nCONS:  \nParking sucks everywhere that you go--its unavoidable.\nLet's not forget that it *is* a school, after all   ;P"
"Was visiting Pitt a while back and everyone said Big Jims was the place to eat. They couldnt have been more right. Big Jims is a place you wouldnt even notice as a restaurant on the outside and I cant even recall any businesses surrounding it. The food is where this place really shines.  I settled on the Veal Parmesan and couldnt believe my eyes when it came to the table, the veal was bigger than my platter!  I couldnt even finish my meal and ended up taking half of it home, great value for the money.     They also make homemade wedding soup thats outta this world!    We woulda dined at Big Jim's our entire time in Pitt but Diners Drive Inn's and Dives happened to be filming while we were there and we couldnt get near the place again, bummer!"
"This past weekend, my wife and I, had the difficult decision to put one of our beloved family members, Lou to sleep.  First off, having a vet office open 7 days a week was very convenient and comforting especially when an emergency occurs during the weekend.  Second, the vet was very affordable especially when they are providing care during what I would consider off-hours (6p on a Saturday).  Third, the staff was very empathetic and easy going during this tough time.  I had such a good experience at Alta Vista I will now begin bringing my other dog's here for their veterinary care."
"Quick friendly service.  These guys actually want you to get the cheapest price with the best coverage.  Imagine that, from an insurance person?"
Went in not open to going to a new dealership but had no other choice.  Scott was great with everything! I couldn't have asked for any better customer service than this and I'm quite picky! I would recommend this place to anyone! Go to Steve he will make sure everything gets done right!
"I am so beside myself ALL THE TIME that I can't find anything that can compare to a Piper's boxty in Wisconsin or Ohio. Every single morsel of food I've EVER put into my mouth at Piper's has been pure heaven. We're only in town for occasional family visits, but we make it an absolute point to stop in to Piper's. Even if we have to fight the throngs of soccer fans during a match.\nThe craft beer! The scotch!! THE BOOOOXXXTYYY.\n\nSee y'all on Christmas eve."
"This is THE Dairy Queen in the Madison metro.  Notice how the Sun Prairie location has no reviews....because nobody goes there.  Anyway, they have a very strong selection of on hand ice cream cakes, if you are looking to pick up a surprise for your special lady on the way home from work.  They are generally pretty busy probably due to their south Fish Hatch location, so its not the FASTEST place on earth to get a cone if that's what you want.  They have all of the standard DQ delicacies.  The prices are standard.  I gave it four stars because I give a regular Brazier three, and this is the best one in the Madison area, as stated."
Thad did a really good job on my heart tattoo.  The place is kind of old and dingy but the work area environment was sterile.\nI would defiantly let Thad do another tattoo for me.
"I'm pretty sure Brewski's is my favorite dive bar.  Definitely in the South Side, possibly in the whole city.  I spent so many Friday nights there when I was younger that part of my love could be just because I have such fond memories.  Even when it's packed, it's still a good time.  I'll be gone for years and the bartenders still remember me when I return.  And you can't beat the prices.  \n\nDon't go if you hate crowds, though.  This place will get packed.  But if you think you can handle it, don't be afraid to go to the back.  There are tables with more space to move around that people either forget about or don't know are there.  Standing around the bar can get annoying with people walking back and forth so I'd recommend working your way to the back and setting up camp there.  You can still get the bartender's attention from the far end of the bar.  An added bonus: you'll be closer to the awesome jukebox."
Bars like this are why Pittsburgh is a neat town.
Ronald's donuts are AMAZING but buyer be warned:  they only take cash.  But soooo worth it!
"""Lately I've noticed two things.\n\nFirst, the friendliness of the staff at Chick-Fil-A has gone up exponentially.  I don't think it's just one store in particular, because it seems to be at all locations (or at least all of them we visit).  Second, the fries are tasting better.  It's not that the fries themselves are different, because they look or even really taste new, but they seem to be letting them cook longer, which leads to crispier fries, instead of those nasty limp waffle things that they used to put out.\n\nNow I just need to make sure to remember to ask for \""""well done\"""" fries just in case, and I think I can actually grow to like these Chick-Fil-A fries... I still don't really care for the spicy chicken, however.  I can let them slide on that as long as they offer hot sauce on the condiment bar and free chicken once a year, however."""
"I'm not a big sweets person, and most cake/dessert is just horrifyingly sweet, but my friend ordered a cake from Suarez for her birthday (vanilla with a pink almond-y buttercream icing) and it was both gorgeous AND tasty. The buttercream icing was creamy designed Into gorgeous florettes, and not stiff or frosting-like (for me, a VERY good thing). The cake itself was moist, and the entire presentation was lovely. I'd definitely recommend Suarez in the future."
"SO RANDOM. SO GOOD. Came close to running scared when I saw this place. Don't run. The food is Fantastic.  Service was casual and comfortable. This is Clearly a family-run spot with everyone doing what they are good at.  No frills, but random enough to be entertaining.  A few pseudo-sophisticated dishes (very well prepared) such as the orange marmalade/cream cheese stuffed French toast and the overall yum factor of the classics, keeps this from being a typical diner.  Did I mention how random....?"
"Quick service, good sandwiches, and best salad bar.  The salad bar is behind the counter and the staff are great. The owner is a bit annoying hitting on all the girls like he thinks he's cool, but he's okay."
"""Let's see... I need a birthday card, some Beanie Babies, a bumper sticker, a bouquet of flowers, some balloons and a keychain that turns into a flyable kite. You'll find all these items... and many you've never even imagined existed at the Green Woodpecker. \n\nThis store is crammed to the gills with... \""""stuff\"""". T-shirts, board games, gigantic Pez dispensers. I can't even begin to list the assortment of strange accoutrement you'll find at this little shop. It's the place you need to go to find the gift for that person that has it all. You can even pick up a candy bar, a bag of chips or other assorted snacks if you have a case of the munchies. \n\nThe Green Woodpecker will also deliver flower arrangements for those extra special occasions. A fun little shop to browse, even if you don't need to buy Magnetic Cat Poetry or a gun that catapults miniature plastic ninjas. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind: The minimum purchase amount if you are using a credit card is $5.00 but if you have a penchant for the unusual, that shouldn't be a problem."""
"This place is always spot on. It can certainly be a little on the greasy side, but on the rare occasions that I actually order pizza, I want to indulge. The price is great in comparison to the proportion and the staff is always friendly (even when really busy)."
"I have to say I am incredibly impressed with how quickly the staff at the hotel wrote back about my review. It goes to show my first impression on the staff was correct. It's hard to not be a fan of them. I would go back again for a second try, maybe I went on an off weekend. Definitely be sure to ask for a golf view though."
"Wandered across this place by accident while looking for a Mobil gas station. The food was at least a notch above bar food, and not terribly expensive at all. I didn't go there during a game, so service was quick and friendly. It's WAAAAY off the strip, which is why I think the prices were, well, normal. I will definitely try to go there again next time I'm in Vegas."
"Eat N' Park is the place you go when you find yourself out with friends late at night and you're looking for a place to hang. I've found myself here after many such events - proms, weddings, birthday parties, you name it. The food is not that great at all, but it's cheap, predictable, and since I've moved from Pittsburgh, it always feels a bit like home. It's definitely an integrated part of what Pittsburgh feels like to me. I've always had good service when I've gone here, and as others have said, it is the home of the Smiley cookie. What more could you want?"
"I have been staying in the Embassy Suites on business for a little over two weeks now and I've dined at the Omaha at least 5 times for both lunch and dinner. Upon my arrival at the Embassy it was raining and miserable outside, so not being familiar with the area I just decided to eat at the Omaha for convience. Going  there has proven to be one of the best dining decisions I've ever made. My waitress was so genuinely friendly and helpful when it came to choosing menu items (I don't eat much red meat). Every time I go back she greets me by name and welcomes me again, even when she isn't my server. I have yet to eat anything on their menu that wasn't delicious and have almost tried everything, the crab cakes being my favorite. This place is definatly worth a try and seems to have something for everyone. If you're in the area, it's worth it."
"Went for dinner- decent crowd but didn't have to wait. Husband had the French Dip sandwich, I had the Pesto Chicken Wrap. Both meals were awesome, except the pickles were left on the side... If you hate pickles you understand the horror. Great service, nice place to watch a game."
i love this place..\nI model a bit in Vegas and they get so excited when I come in..they recognize me..\nThere is awful karaoke on the big screens and the atmosphere is not so hot..but its young..old..and warm.\nTheir hot pots of tom yum is outstanding and reasonably priced..\ntheir papaya salad is fantastic..\nI am a fish eater only..so im not the best reviewer of meaty meals..\nthey are quick..open late (till 2 i think) and will accommodate your dietary desires..
$5 for cup of boba tea is a bit pricy but it's pretty good. Quality over quantity.
"Excellent service from the front and back of the house. When I asked for a change up from one type of noodle to the other, no problem. When I asked for a half portion vs full, no problem. The wait staff was excellent. They were friendly, quick to deliver drinks, extra bread etc... And lets not forget the food, it was delicious."
"In the area visiting and wanted Mexican food.  Reviews were good therefore gave it a try.  At first, the place was not what I expected.  Instead of being seated and served, you order at a counter and wait for a number to be called.  \n\nWe ordered cheese crisps - a baked flour tortilla with melted cheese - essentially an open face quesadilla.  It was very good.\n\nWe ordered tamale, enchiladas (red chile), carne asada and green chile tamales. All were good except the asada was a little dry.\n\nWe finished with sopapillas with honey.  These were very good as well.  I wish we could find these in California.\n\nOverall,  the food was good to very good. Four stars due to the dry carne asada.\n\nLarge portions of food and fairly priced."
"Based on other Yelp reviews, I chose Homer's for our car inspection.  They were able to get us in within 2 days and were very courteous.  The let me know that everything passed, but we would be needing brakes soon.  I discussed a trip we would be taking to Alabama and they felt that they breaks would hold up fine for the trip.  I appreciate their honesty.  I will be bringing my car back for the work later on."
"I couldn't stand the Casino inside the MGM where I was staying because I couldn't get a drink to save my life and the dealers were not friendly and rude.I walked across the street to play blackjack at Hooters. The dealers were friendly and drink service was adequate. The first night I tripled my money and the second night I lost it all, plus some. It's Vegas baby. Although I would say the Pit Boss was a dweeb. A guy at my table had a handful of $100 chips. He asked for a $500.00 chip and was told to go to a better table and he'd get what he wanted. If your seat is hot, why move. Why make this guy hold a handful of chips. Dummy."
"I wanted to love this place, but in the end - I loved the service and the food was ok.   Basically I gave the food 3 starts, but my server Jamie got 5 stars so I compromised with a 4 star review.  My steak was good - I ordered it medium rare and it was a lot closer to rare - but hey, I am adventurous.  My garlic mashed potatoes were over salted - not to the point of inedible - but definitely noticeable.  The appetizer was a bacon wrapped scallop - the scallop was well cooked, but completely overpowered by the bacon.  Maybe just ill conceived?  Bacon should be used to wrap things otherwise devoid of flavor.  I got the soup of the day - which I would rate just OK...sort of one note.  On the positive side - the drinks were great - and the service was excellent."
"I literally walked and biked by this place everyday for 2 years before restaurant boredom brought me in here on a warm April Friday evening. I got the fish fry special on a whim, even though the woman at the front recommended a 3-piece sampler of some sort.\n\nIt was amazing. 2 long and lean pieces of fried fish. No fishy off flavor - fresh and delicious. It was topped with some sort of butter pecan glaze including fresh pecans. To top it off I also got a cup of New England clam chowder which was also totally legit.\n\nHaving lived in the deep south for 10 years, I was very surprised to find this sort of quality in a place I'd passed over so many times. You truly can't judge a book by its cover. I'll be back here very soon, now I want to try to po boy!."
"Last night, a few friends and I came to Mulligan's to enjoy some beers, shots and food.  I've never been to Mulligan's, however, once I heard that this place was right down the road from me, I was totally on board.  \n\nThe place is super dark and has a section for dining and a section for the bar.  There are signs all over and pub style decor.  Remember when you come here, you are NOT allowed to say the F bomb.  If you continue saying that word, you will get kicked out.  I don't know why, but it's a rule they have.\n\nLast night we got the chicken nachos, chicken quesadilla and the spinach and artichoke dip.  The food overall is pub food and good when you had a few drinks down.  Isn't really something I would choose to eat all the time, but it works.  I think I had an overall great experience with the staff and my friends, which made me give a higher than normal rating.  I wouldn't mind coming back if my friends ever chose this place again."
"fast, cheap, and good"
I love Roberto's and this happens to be right by my house so I come here all the time. The food always comes out fast and they always get my order right.\n\nThis location is old and the decor is dumpy ...but I don't go to Robertos for the ambiance.
"It's been a while since I was in this store, so I was surprised to find it much nicer than I remembered.  They've really spiffed up the store, and have vastly increased the electronics selection.\n\nWe came in here to buy a cheap HDMI cable, because a friend told us they had 'em.  We didn't want to have to shell out $35 bucks at Radio Shack or wait for online delivery.  Well, they had all that and a lot more.  Our $7 HDMI cable set us back $89!\n\nI'll be more likely to return to this store, rather than driving further to get to those that have seemed better, until no."
Very good - not great.  Service was good and the resturant and bathrooms were clean
"I find myself coming here more often than the far closer Scottsdale Fashion Park simply because it is a more manageble size. For people that don't want to make shopping a many hour activity, this shopping center is far less daunting.\n\nI enjoy the Macy's at Biltmore because their sales racks are usually bursting at the seams and when you combine the sales with the discount coupons you can really fill your shopping bags with bargains. I find myself having better luck getting the assistance I need at the Biltmore Apple store versus other locations and the new Jonathan Adler store is one of my go-to's for giftware. \n\nThe covered parking is very much appreciated and I personally never seem to have much of a problem finding a spot. The fashion park has a nice ambiance, a nice selection of stores and good options to grab a bite to eat so it is a winner in my book."
"This J&J is located right next to the Gold's Gym I frequent in my neighborhood and I usually come here specifically for Quest bars when I run out, which seems to be a lot.  I normally get my supps at a different nutrition shop, but J&J is just convenient when I need some item immediately.  Have you ever had a Quest bar?  I rely on them when I need portable protein without a lot of carbs, calories, or fat.  Plus, they come in tasty flavors, my favorites being Coconut Cashew, Cinnamon Roll, and Mixed Berry.  They just released Cookies n Cream today, so I'll be heading over to get a couple of bars.  They are always friendly here and will price match, but I haven't used that service as of yet.  If you're in the market for vitamins, protein, supplements, or Quest bars, give J&J a try."
"The staff here was so nice! After being turned down at 2 other nail places for 4 walk in pedicures, LV nails were happy to accommodate us right away even though the salon was fairly busy and they were about to close for the night.  It was such excellent customer service that we will definitely be back again!"
"Laredo's is a simple little Mexican restaurant hidden away in a sad little strip mall. I admit I was hesitant upon walking in, but my brother picked it so I wasn't going to complain. I'm glad I didn't either because I was actually pretty impressed. \n\nThe prices were really reasonable and the menu had plenty of variety to choose from. I had tacos, my bro had an enchilada, and my mother a taco salad. Everyone enjoyed their meals and they came out quick.\n\nI certainly would not hesitate to eat at Laredo's again."
"Thank heavens for the GPS or we never would have found the place! It is off the beaten path but definitely worth the trip! The food was incredible. Appetizer special tonight was crab legs. We went with the waiter's suggestion to have them warm and that was the right call. They were nice and sweet. Even my father-in-law, who claims not to like any meat that comes from a body of water, polished off a bunch and said they were good. Three of us had steaks and they were just as good as leftovers when we couldn't finish. The twice baked potatoes were super tasty. My only regret is not saving room for dessert. The reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the place was absolutely freezing-not just a little chilly. I put my winter coat back on for the entire meal. I think I actually saw my breath!"
"The great thing about Noodles & Company is that no matter which one you go to, it's always consistently good. The portions are a little small for my eating habits, but I'm  pretty sure they're the size we should be eating. \n\nThe qualities having now been listed, I need to point out that, while the regular bowl is listed as $5.25, once you add protein ($2.25), a small drink, and tax, the meal costs over $10 - certainly not an economical lunch option."
"OMg.  The Capastrami.  Just typing it makes my mouth water.\n\nThe Capastrami IS SO GOOD!  My friends were TOTALLY RAVING about it, and usually when my friends overhype things it will ruin the experience for me.  But no.  This is ONE OF THE FEW times that I could not even begin to understand how awesome it would be.  \n\nColeslaw in a pastrami sandwich?? I know, I know, it sounds strange.  But it truly is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  The coleslaw is most delicious sandwich surprise EVER.  \n\nI don't know what else to say, except that I really think that everyone should try it.  It's THAT good."
This place is SUPER delicious. I just love the Singapore Rice Noodles. Highly recommended. The only downside is that it can get a little busy during dinner time and parking is hard to come by. It's worth the wait though!
"They changed from 'resort' to hotel no matter what the name is the is a nice place to stay. The rooms are top notch, I've never had a bad meal in the gallery restaurant. There are several bars on the property one right off the main lobby which has a balcony overlooking the 18th green. The other bar has a nice feel with a big screen to watch a game, etc. \n\nThey added a new pool last year which makes the property more attractive. I've never used the spa so I really do not know much about it. \n\nI ha e played the course and used the range. It is playable for the average golfer but the width of the fairways is gonna be a challenge if you can not keep it at least a little straight. The greens are somewhat forgiving but in the middle of the summer they get fast.\n\nI think they have a golf school there but not sure. The pro shop has all you need high end. They have club rental also."
"We just left here and I can barely move. It's a giant buffet with all the right things on it. Now understand that it is a massive quantity, high volume buffet, so the quality of the food isn't perfect but it is so very good that I am giving this buffer 5 stars."
Great for the price. Nice and cozy. Was expecting much less. Cheap and not too far from anything
"Been to this restaurant location several times since I moved to Las Vegas, and I too think that ownership has changed a few times since my first visit 3+ years ago.\n\nAnyway, the sushi chef works hard to create the rolls and nigiri orders from customers in a timely manner.  He even gives update, such as the Fish and Chips Roll is being deep fried and will be ready in x minutes.  Although I was in no rush, I do appreciate being kept in the loop.  In business, just like in life, it is the little things that matters.\n\nAs far as the food.  I have no complaint, except that uni is always out when I decided to go.  It could just me my poor timing plus it is not a deal breaker for me. I definitely don't think that it is a top AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas, but it is fairly close by. On my latest visit, everyone there was in a good mood and enjoying the meal.  Service was good.  And I would definitely be back again.\n\n3.5 stars!"
"Everyone in the place were very nice and welcoming. The wait was pretty long, but I expected it since I just walked-in, didn't make an appointment. I was surprised on how much less I paid than I expected. The service was great, it was cheap. Overall, it's a great place to get glasses, or eye exams."
"Great, inexpensive food. The only downside is the limited seating, but I suppose that's part of its charm."
"I'd never had Nepalese food before coming here.  Now I visit Chautara several times a month.  The food is somewhat similar to Indian, but feels much lighter.  Nothing I've ever ordered here was oily or greasy, and I never feel weighed down after a meal.  There are lots of veggies in most of the dishes, and everything has a lot of flavor, so it's a good place for vegetarians.  As an omnivore, I really appreciate that the veggie dishes are not the least bit bland or boring.  They have two choices of salad dressing: both are great, both are on the sweet side.  The vinaigrette is tangier.  Their house soup is like dal and is fantastic.  i've never had anything here that wasn't absolutely delicious.  If you are on a budget their lunches are quite affordable.  My only wish is that they had a bigger variety of (non-booze) drinks."
"At first glance this is just another 50's retro diner,but the food is much better than you'd think. Burgers rate about 8,fries and shakes 7. Service is about what you would expect. I was surprised to find something this good at the Stratosphere."
"""Small, dark, lots of weird decorations, cash only, no shots, free popcorn, no swearing, 50's and 60's music playing, drinks priced right. This is a first class dive bar!!! The men's room was built for midgets. It's a bar you will either love or hate. I love it, mixed crowd and it's a fun time. Don't expect any food other than the popcorn. The owner told me one night, \""""this is a saloon for drinking not swearing\""""!!  WTF!!!"""
"Roses you say? This place has the most beautiful ones I've EVER seen in Madison. Every time I order from them, I'm not disappointed.Yes, I'm picky. I'm picky about what goes in the vase. No RED roses, leather leaf, babies breath, or carnations for this girl. When I called George's to place my order, they let me speak directly to a designer. The recipient of the flowers was thrilled and I was thrilled with the excellent customer service, and product. If it's Roses you want, in the most intersting, elegant, lovely, arrangement, or just by themselves, call George's. And please, no carnations, leather leaf, babies breath or RED roses. There is so much more out there if you just ask."
"Good coffee, mediocre muffins.  Service is always very friendly and they get my picky order right even without me watching like a hawk.  They have Coke and Diet Coke if you're not in a coffee mood.  Wifi is free, not $10 a pop like at Starbucks if you're not on T-mobile.  \n\nThey are literally right next to Brueggers Bagels and it's easy to walk in the wrong door.  Five stars because... well just because..."
I came to Dr. moxley's office after I was referred from another dentist. Every single person I came in contact with at his office was extremely nice! Dr. Moxley explained everything that needed to be done and he and his staff took car of me quickly and efficiently. The previous doctor I had seen told me I would have to have an incision in my gum to remove to tooth but it wasn't necessary at all. Kudos to Jeff Moxley for not putting me through unnecessary pain and a costly procedure. I will definitely recommend to anyone.
"Very good and cheap but crappy service. The staff is slow, rude and inefficient."
"I love nostalgia and Renfrow's has it in spades.  Places like this are dying all around the country never to return so get your fill of this classic hardware store while you can.  I like to stop in and grab a soda out of their cooler because for some reason, everything tastes better from a real glass bottle from an old cooler.  \n\nThey also have baby chicks...my son digs the baby chicks.  \n\nThey have more than chicks and soda and in fact, they have a surprising amount of stuff and a friendly knowledgeable staff to back it up."
"If you have a thousand bucks in disposable income, there's nowhere better to be than South Park Mall. This place is teeming with WASPs (and maybe a few WASCs buzzing in there as well). \n\nStandard food court with a recent addition of a Chipotle - the family restroom is a lifesaver if you have a pile of tiny kids with you.\n\nThe stores are more upscale than most area malls and coupled with a generally sparkly clean aesthetic, it's easy to feel out of place without a perfectly coiffed hairstyle, plastic surgery, and a new wardrobe.\n\nBut you don't have to feel substandard for long - there's an Aveda salon and a plethora of clothing and shoe stores to peruse for the latest fashions...straight from....Raleigh? \n\nAnd as for the plastic surgery, just chalk it up to a deviated septum and get a nose job already!!\n\nComparable to Lenox Mall in Atlanta, I appreciate this mall for its variety in stores, both boutique-y and department. While I don't choose to spend all my hard-earned dollars here, I can see how easily a person could."
"Clean, nice hotel in the Pitt area.  Has happy hour during the middle of the week, which is nice in a state with odd liquor laws which prevent you from buying beer in small amounts.  Staff was friendly, the the beds were comfortable.  Decent outdoor pool and a nice workout room."
"""When you look for this place, you're looking for the sign that says \""""Golden Metropole\"""" in the little shopping strip next to Dim Sum on Central Ave.  I used to trek over to Lang Van all the time to get my dose of pho, but I'm starting to think that this place may be better.  The broth has a more interesting flavor, and my perception, at least lately, has been that the quality of meat used in the pho is better.  Pho Hoa is a franchise chain, but each one is a little different and this one seems to have a few specials and items that are not part of the standard franchise menu.  Their menu is no more unusual than any other Charlotte Vietnamese restaurant, but they do it right and they open at 9:00 a.m. so that you can have pho for breakfast traditional stylee."""
"I can walk out the front door and wander in any given direction; eventually I'll hit a Lowes store. This one is the oldest in my area. You can tell it's an older store, but it's hardly busted by any means. \n\nThe service here is better than Concord Mills or Northlake; the cashiers are friendly and the floor staff puts out the extra effort to find what you are looking for. They're always around when you need them. \n\nBest time to go for plant selection seems to be mid week; everything has been picked over by the weekend.\n\nThe lighting in the store is better than Home Depot; could be why I prefer it more."
"Pamela's is incredibly delicious. Those crepe style pancakes melt on your tongue and despite them being so thin, they are very filling. If you eat a Pamela's breakfast, be prepared not to eat anything else that day. The potatoes are crazy good, made with onions and magic and who knows what else, but they taste like heaven. Wish I had that recipe! If you are from Pittsburgh, I'm guessing you could sing Pamela's praises. If you are visiting Pittsburgh, this is THE place to have breakfast/brunch. Yes, they have a lunch menu. But why order a sandwich at a breakfast place? If a place is known to be one of the best at something, why fight it? I'm judging you.\nThis location is not my favorite. It's unique in that it's inside a functional old timey drug store. There isn't a ton of seating and the line backs up and winds around the store, which is awkward. The Pamela's in the strip is superior as far as expedited seating and service. But if you are in Millvale and don't mind waiting near the NyQuil, grab some pancakes and potatoes. Cash only!"
I love this place. Friendly people and great service. I usually get their $21.99 deal and that is where my problem is. I wish it was a little cheaper but my truck does come out looking really good. They gloss all my black moldings and pieces on my truck and they do it well. Another set back is the speed of it all. It seems like there aren't as many people working so the service is a little longer than usual. Still highly recommended.
Ordered 1/4 white box for lunch.  Also ordered gizzards to share with my party (not the most popular party gift).  \n\nFive stars for chicken- delicious and moist. Possibly the best fried chicken I have ever had.\n\nFive stars for tots- great texture and taste.\n\nFive stars for the price. One of many good and economical lunches in Charlotte. In Phoenix (home) it seems like chain fast food is the only way to eat lunch under $10.\n\nFour stars for the slaw\n\nThree stars for hush puppies. Dry and not much taste.\n\nThree stars for gizzards- too light on the breading for my taste.\n\nI will be back but stay clear of gizzards.
"Great burgers, fries, sandwiches and just about everything else. $5 pitchers of yeungling is a hell of a plus. The wait can get kind of ridiculous for a burger, but so worth it, especially if you grab a beer while you wait. The only thing I've had from the Penguin that wasn't good were the onion rings - they're thin and super greasy. I know lots of people that love them, they're just not for me."
"Busy lunch, on a sunday afternoon or otherwise, pho saigon 8 never disappoints. Today im having chicken pho with bean thread noodles. They are super accomodating with requests!  Love that. \n\nEverybody's hustling through the busy lunch and noone skips a beat. My only beef with the hustle and bustle today is the lack of napkins. Wow. Dont get me wtong, Im a fan of using my pants , but not even one when my food came. 2 servers said they bting some asap... Still waiting... Doesnt ruin my pho experience, this place is still the best in town. Mental note, Bring napkins next time."
Very professional and efficient! The final cost was less than the original estimate (I sold some items prior to the move and I also had all my items boxed and labeled). This is definitely a reputable company and I would use them again for my moving needs. The only issue I noticed was that they propped the washer and dryer up to the connection and did NOT secure the connections. I would advise/suggest you check the connections before they leave or before you attempt to do laundry.
"This place is good for what it is. Cheap Chinese take out. I've eaten here several times and have good good each time. The only weird one that I had was the chow mein, not what I was expecting. \n\nOne thing that I do like this place for is the egg rolls. \n\nDining in area is small and a little weird for me but they have seats."
So we found this spot by the house. Came first for dine in. Small restaurant but that is why we like it. I dislike crowded restaurants.  I like to be able to enjoy my meal. \n\nLooks like a lot of the business is take out too. We have now ordered here twice in the last week.  Still miss my Chinese food style from Hawaii but these guys are good!  This has become my go to place.
"Great work and very honest.  They will tell you when you need  to take your car to a dealer, but can do most work themselves.  They have kept my  newish Prius and my 13 year old Honda going and are helpful in anticipating and solving problems in advance.  I have gone there for 17 years and referred many people, all of whom have been very happy too."
"The food is undoubtedly delicious, but they are very pushy. The service was pretty awful; the waiter kept on pushing us to pair our wines even though we said we didnt want to. Just be careful if you go with a specific budget in mind to not get sucked into more by pressure."
"I actually like coming here,you feel comfortable and their workers are friendly (: when you call to make appointments or fix any sort of problem they're not rude at all (:."
This the area you bring a friend with you and be sure both of you have a gun. But the food is more than worth it
"LOVE Snicks! I usually roll in here when I am not feeling like sucking in my gut. Nick the bartender was the first person in Vegas to be nice to me. I was here the other night just chillin and palying the Juke box. \n\nAtmosphere? Well, it sorta smells like Popcorn and Disability checks."
"Awesome service!  They let my Korean friends have a taste of almost everything (I was full from that!)\n\nThe food was fresh and tasty.  The only disappointing part was my garlic rice: it could've been more garlicy (is that a word?) and there were sections that were hard, like 5 day old rice.  Yuck.\n\nMy non-Filipino friends really enjoyed the experience.  Thanks!"
"I haven't spent as much time in Artist and Craftsman as I should and I have always known that, however today really made me see that I need to go in there more often! Not only was the service great, I was escorted directly to what I was looking for but when I was a dollar short Greg fronted me the dollar out of his own pocket using the honor system! I will be going back tomorrow with his dollar and to pick up a few more things! \n\nMy great experience today aside, they have always had everything that I have ever needed and for really good prices for a nice quality art shop!"
"Pretty good place to workout. Price is decent. Also the old guy upfront is really friendly and humble. Always taking care of everyone. Always reminding everyone to put their weight back after they use it. Always trying to keep everyone rolling. I hate when people use the weight and never put them back. Unorganized people. But hey, I like how he always manage to keep everything so that the gym looks great everytime I workout."
"""I'm going to piggy back off what another user said: Yes, this place is a dive, but a classy dive. \n\nAs far as the cleanliness, this place is immaculate. Tables and chairs and floors are always spotless. And I've never seen cleaner bathrooms in a \""""dive\"""" bar before. It really puts all other bathrooms to shame. Can't speak for the men's room though. \n\nBartenders are quick, attentive, and not bad to look at! Plenty of seating in the bar and outside. You'll never be left look for a place to set your drink down. Always lots of events going on here: car shows, bike nights, live music, football, and last night the whole bar even watched Sons of Anarchy together. \n\nI adore this bar. It attracts people of all kinds and ages and everyone always has a really good time. Great place to go on any night of the week."""
"Oh Skinny Dugan's.  Back in the day it was my underage drinking establishment of choice.  It's still not a bad place to go if you're in the neighborhood to grab a drink or even some food.  (As far as bar food goes, Skinny's pretty much can't be beat.)  The clientele ranges from the older, video poker playin' crowd to corporate sports teams having after-game drinks to families from down the street just trying to get some grub.  The bartenders, owners and waitresses are very friendly and attentive as well.  Not a lot of character, but lots of heart."
"I can't speak much on their overall security services, but the customer service I've experienced here has been great so far. We've been meaning to copy a key at a locksmith (Home Depot can't do this particular key), when lo and behold, as we were pulling out of Orchid Gardens on the way to Meadows Mall, we see the locksmith sign. I can't remember the name of the gentleman who helped us, but he copied our key swiftly and for a relatively cheap price. We also inquired about changing the locks of our home and he broke down pricing, possible lock options, and provided us the phone # of the people who handle the planning of the services. He didn't make us feel stupid for asking very basic questions about locks. There were also plenty of other people in the store looking at their large safes. Looks like folks in Vegas have a lot of stuff to lock up ;)"
"If you can get past the sometimes not too great service, the food is awesome. Drinks are great too. Especially the frozen daiquiris. Could definitely have better drink specials throughout the week. I really love the taco salads. \n\nOnly complaint of all of my multiple visits: Rushed us out on my birthday. Made us feel like we had overstayed our welcome. I'm a bartender and always tip based on time spent as well so I didn't appreciate feeling like I was being pushed out of the door."
"solid, quick, and cheap. long lines during lunch."
"As a person who has lived in Utah her whole life, Lees liquor was an alcoholic HEAVEN.\n\nThe selection at Lees is absolutely amazing. I spent about an hour just walking up and down the aisles, in pure awe that alcohol in that many different flavors and styles existed. It was truly mind blowing to compare a Vegas liquor store to a Utah liquor store. I probably don't have to say this, but I'll never be happy with Utah's liquor selection again.\n\nI ended up stocking up on a bunch of alcohol that I couldn't get at home, and went to check out. The cashier was friendly, and we ended up having a discussion about I how we both have Misfits tattoos. He was knowledgable and helpful. \n\nFor how much liquor I bought, the prices weren't too bad either. It was a great trip, and I had a ton of fun sampling everything that I had bought.\n\nI do agree with the previous review stating that it's easy to knock over bottles. I personally didn't knock any over, but I came close once or twice. Be careful."
"From the outside this place looks like a neighborhood dive bar.  Step through the feng shui red door, and things take on a different feel.\n\nI've lunched at CC's at least 10 times, but only once for dinner.  Go with a friend for lunch, and split these two items:  the ahi tuna sandwich, and the butternut squash ravioli.  The soup is also quite tasty.\n\nCost:  Cheap, amazing food for lunch...not cheap (3X more) for dinner."
"I didn't even know that real bookstores still existed! I was in Phoenix for work and had some time to kill so I walked in! I got a coffee, actually flipped through some magazines and even picked up a real live book. I haven't touched a new book in years as I generally only read e-books now. \n\nHad fun. Store is well kept and has a good selection of magazines and of course books. DVDs and music selection wasn't too bad either.\n\nMakes me kinda wish there were big bookstores near my house in Chicago. I miss some of the brick and mortar stores of years gone by..."
"Our server, Betelehem, was fast, efficient, and very nice, although she was really busy on a Sunday morning. We had two people plus an order to go. It took a while to get our food-maybe 15 mins - not bad considering how busy they were. Get the hash browns - they are really nicely done with real potatoes, skins and all. Pancakes are amazing too. Dense and flavorful. I got the veggie omelet and it was good but way too big so I took half home. Coffee is strong with a bitter aftertaste. I like it that way but may not be for everyone. We were prepared to wait for a table as the parking lot was jammed and people were streaming in from all over but they seated us in about 2 minutes. The hostess could have been more friendly when checking us in. The building has an open ceiling so all the sounds reverberate making the atmosphere rather noisy during busy times. Next time I might try the Dutch Baby. I remember those being pretty tasty from past visits to the locations in Las Vegas."
"I had the steak burger ($9) and it was quite good. They actually made it medium rare (I've had trouble getting anything rarer than medium in Pittsburgh when I order medium rare). It comes on a long soft, roll- it's definitely different, but palatable nonetheless. The burger had a nice char on the outside and was still juicy on the inside. It came with a mix of regular fries and sweet potato and those were a nice touch. I had a brown ale of sorts ($4.50) and it was not too malty and not too heavy. Service was quick and the staff was helpful."
"The staff is very knowledgeable about every question I have had with their products.  When I did have a question they didn't know the answer to, they pulled out some of the product and experimented with me until we were both satisfied with the answer.  \n\nThey have tons of costumes as well.  If by some small chance they don't have what you want, they will order it in.\n\nI highly recommend this shop!!!"
"added the lengua taco to the tried list today -- wow -- so delicious...\n\ndon't know what Gabriel is talking about fried fish -- their fish is only served as cocktails or on the half shell (oysters) -- no fish tacos -- nothing fried.  And the cashier always speaks english -- she has to since she runs the drive thru, too -- \n\nYes, there aren't that many white folk -- but that's fine with me -- Took my 72 year old white mother for tongue and pastor tacos -- and to share a shrimp cocktail, with watermelon juice --   tears, people, tears, it was so good...   I keep looking for flaws, but there just aren't any."
"I know they're a chain, but I gotta admit that I like Panera.  They serve good food and coffee and have free Wi-Fi, but their ambiance is pretty low key and welcoming.  I like the local feel of Murray Avenue, but lots of the places here aren't exactly welcoming, clean, or up-to-date.  Hopefully, places like Panera and Starbucks will put a little pressure on the locals to shape up or ship out.  Until then, I'm glad Panera's here.\n\nI don't think I've ever eaten anything here that I wasn't completely satisfied with, and the chipotle chicken sandwich is outstanding."
Staff is nice and the price is fair. Car condition is superior.
"The movers were very careful, fast, and efficient. Although the quotation was higher than many of the movers I had researched, the prudent and meticulous handling they exhibited for all of my move items was worth every penny.  I have moved over a dozen times across the US and this was the very time that movers did NOT make ANY dings, stray marks, or scratches anywhere in my brand new home. THe condition  of the home was exactly the same as it was prior to several hours of moving. Outstanding job by this crew who arrived at the scheduled time and finished slightly ahead of the projected time which included careful wrapping off all my furniture items including sofas, love seat, piano keyboard,  a couple of queen sized bedroom suites and exercise equipment....BEST move ever!!!! Defintely recommend and would use them again in a heartbeat!"
"This is where I learned that fried cheese curds taste surprisingly just like mozzarella sticks. Maybe that's not so surprising after all.\n\nIf you too want to learn this, head to the bar for the late night menu. Here you'll be treated to good eats at affordable prices. Take, for example, the steak sandwich. A steal of a deal, and not half bad. The burger also looked atrociously large and delicious.\n\nIt's small and cramped, but why worry about that when there's well-priced grub to be had?"
"""SALVATION FROM VEGAS BUFFETS AND OVERPRICED EATERIES!!!!\n\nAfter a hard day of riding (scooters), we dialed up this place on the Yelp app and decided to give it a go.\n\nI ordered the Thai beef jerky (awesome!) and the beef Pad Kee Mao (not on the menu, but most true Thai places know how to make it...plus it was hilarious to hear the cook yell, \""""PAD KEE MAO!!!!!\"""" in the kitchen).    As to why such a fantastic dish as the Pad Kee Mao was and still wasn't on the menu (as far as I could see), I'll never understand.\n\nAnyway, huge portions, great food, good prices, def worth the short cab (or scooter) ride up the strip for when your looking for something more than fancy microwaved dishes with some Food Network chef's name attached to them or feeding troth buffet that litter the Vegas strip.\n\nThe good:\n+ friendly, attentive staff\n+ took special orders (PAD KEE MAO!)\n+ great quantity and taste for the money\n\nThe not-so-good:\n- a little ways north of most of the major casinos on the LVS\n- sign is hard to see at night, as it is lost against the barrage of other signs it must compete with"""
"good variety on their menu. southern food, but not EVERYTHING on their menu feels greasy, like other places around here. very affordable, which is a plus. The staff is always pleasant, too."
"I have never been to an Applebee's before. I try to avoid chain restaurants as a whole, but I had to meet a group there. Surprisingly, the food was good. I had the quesadilla burger, and although it was different, it was good. I also tried the artichoke dip and deep fried green bans, which I loved! The others with me also enjoyed their food. The waitress was very friendly and provided great service. This is one chain that I will return to, especially for the deep fried green beans!"
"I used to get all my routine car care here and they always did a good job and charged very reasonable rates.  The work always completed on time.  I only had them do oil changes, tires, flush and fills, etc.  The guys were nice enough, but it was the overall experience that brought me back."
"Great rates on all services.  As one who hats ironing, it's worth $1.50 per shirt for my work clothes to have them laundered and pressed here.  Friendly owners and always ready when they say they will be.\n\nOnly downside is sometimes due to the pressing machines, pleats and collars are pressed crooked or away from the fold, but when going fast and using machinery, that's bound to happen and I can live with it."
"The best pizza, period.  Mineo's is fine.  Nothing wrong with it.   But Aiello's is not only better, but the place is much cleaner and staff much nicer.  No atmosphere to speak of.  No delivery.  No parking.  Cash only.  Just good f'in' pizza.  It is the first place friends who have moved away eat at when the come home to visit."
"Best cat Dr I have ever had. She knows & remembers their personalities, much love at this hospital. None lIke it I have ever seen, home to the unwanted cats. GREAT"
"This is probably the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh for what it is.  There are others which seem more authentic and popular with people who are Chinese (e.g., Tasty restaurant on S. Highland), and others yet which are super upscale (Richard Chen's in Eastside --also off of S. Highland).   This place has a great chicken with green chili peppers and a number of other dishes.  The bubble teas are also wonderful.   A couple of dishes are kind of goofy, like a chinese version of chicken fried chicken steak.  I am not sure if this is actually a modified authentic recipe or a pander to American palates in the worst possible way.  In any case the chili chicken makes up for most transgressions."
"""I have been going to Pin Kaow for many years and they always have impeccable service and food. The egg rolls are awesome, the satay with peanut butter sauce will make your eyes roll back in your head and the cucumber salad is perfect.

For all you ladies you may not want to pick 10, Ha Ha. I only have one small complaint and that's the iced tea. They serve Nestea.  Very nasty tea!!"""
"This is seriously the nicest Kmart that I have ever been in my life so I decided that it warrants a Yelp review.  The store looked new and was fully stocked.  I don't know about you but the local Kmart  in Seattle look like crap with half empty shelves, especially the one in North Seattle off 135th and Aurora.  What sets this place apart is that it included an area that had video poker and slot machines for all you gamblers that need a fix but can't afford to get to the strip or old town Vegas.  We came in here at noon on a Wednesday to buy some pain relievers after hiking the Grand Canyon the previous day and there was seriously like 5 people in here gambling away their life savings. \n\nNow that's cool!!!!"
Kyle and team did a great job! I stopped in with a transmission that had been overfilled by another Jiffy Lube in IL. Kyle and the team got me in and out at no charge. This is why I continue to be a Jiffy Lube customer for well over 10 years.
"When you go to a place, and its named after a dish, for the love of everything, order that!\n\nThe omelets here are super huge and super filling.  The height of the omelet alone is just shy of an inch! They super fill the omlet as well, I don't think this meal is made for a normal person.\nI also love how they do the potatoes!\n\nI wanted sausage and biscuits and regret not ordering an omelet.  The gravy was pretty weak and lacked in flavor. (-1 star)\n\nThe staff were super nice and welcoming.  The place is pretty packed with regulars and not many tourists (like our group).\n\nIf you drove to LV, or willing to cab it, I'd say its more than worth it!"
"The best fast food sandwich place evah! EVAH! Puts Subway, Quizno's, Schlotsky's and even the cutesy mom and pop ones to shame! \n\nOh the bread. The crusty and delicious bread. The shredded lettuce. The perfectly round and red slices of tomato...Damn it I can't get to Vegas quick enough now! \n\nI would give a limb  to have a JJ's in Los Angeles. The #1 Pepe is the best ham and cheese I have ever had!\n\nAnd to top it all off this place is CHEAP!"
"""I ate here last night for the first time for dinner. I was craving Mexican and decided I would venture away from my typical Azteca and try something new. Monterrey is tucked back in an unassuming strip mall. The inside is completely different than what you would expect on the outside. It is really nicely decorated and very \""""Mexican restaurant\"""". We were promptly greeted with warm chips and salsa. I got the enchiladas verdes and they were pretty good. My boyfriend got the chicken and cheese (queso con pollo) and it was okay. I have definitely had better Mexican food, but this is a solid place for cheap, American-Mexican cuisine. I was disappointed that they only had chicken or ground beef tacos. I like shredded pork or beef tacos and would like to see that added to the options."""
"this is my go to once a week thai binge spot. i basically get the exact same order ever (DAMN) time and im never disappointed. For reference, thats the 42, spicy level 3 (so i can add my own sriracha) and some assortment of chicken, beef and or shrimp, although ive largely stopped ordering the beef here because its just a little on the chewy side. The thai salad is also awesome. I would however stay away from their duck, as its just not that awesome, kudos for putting it on, but unfortunately it just doesnt deliver (for me at least). The order guy is super cool, hes a white dude who speaks thai, and all the servers there are just salt of the earth nice people, so its really quite nice to eat here be it dine in or take out!"
"""A very pretty natural food establishment.  I'm not crazy about the kind of cramped layout, which really is inconvenient, considering how many people are always there.  Still, it's usually a nice experience.\n\nThey have some of the best produce available in Madison (and also the most expensive).  When I made Beef Wellington one day, they were the only place that had truly gorgeous-looking cuts of Fillet Mignon (again, expensive).  \n\nThe really nice thing about Whole Foods is the \""""Whole Foods brand.\""""  This allows you to buy things at a reasonable price.  :)  I also am a big fan of their take-out/deli foods.

"I hired Easy Movers to unload a 28' ABF U-Pack trailer that was filled to the brim. Scheduling the move was easy, and the employee in their main office was very helpful and professional. On moving day, the crew arrived approximately 30 minutes after the arrival window, which is the only reason why I took off one star. \n\nOnce Marcus and his crew arrived, Marcus walked me through some basic paperwork. I really appreciated how Easy Movers document the start and stop times and have the customer initial to confirm their accuracy. Once this was done, the crew got right to work. \n\nThere were four guys on the crew, and they were all very friendly, careful with my belongings, and efficient. If they had a question about where something went, they were sure to ask. They are very capable movers as well, and they handled my larger furniture with ease. It took them just two hours to unload the trailer. Impressive!\n\nIf I ever need help moving in the Charlotte area again, I won't hesitate to hire Easy Movers. They are a great alternative to the larger, non-local moving companies in the area."
"The first time I've regretted my bariatric surgery. Seriously the food was amazing, the staff polite, and the new restaurant was gorgeous. I only wish I could have enjoyed more food there."
"This is my absolute favourite place to get food in the food court at the West Towne Mall. The food is perfect and amazing. You will not regret choosing Sarku. You might see someone giving out samples, make sure you give it a try, you will love it. Their is commonly a long line, which sucks but what are you going to do about it. And im not going to lie, its sometimes hard to understand the employees, but they do a good job. But when i have only a few bucks on me i cant grab sarku, since it will run you around $7-9 for a meal."
Deep-fried pickles?  Check.\nUltra cheap beers?  Check.\nEverything too sloppy to eat by hand?  Check.\nWait-staff that looks like a bunch of myopic Jr. Varsity Hell's Angels?   Check.\n\nAll systems go!  Blast off into the greasy heavens!
"""Our first visit to Lombardino's, three or four years ago, was so-so, and I was a little nervous about going back. But something's changed, because our experience last night was phenomenal. Luckily it's still tomato season, and because Lombardino's changes their offerings throughout the year to use seasonal ingredients, we were able to enjoy the \""""tomato menu\"""". The tomato/onion/basil salad was the best thing I'd eaten all summer. For dinner, I ordered the roasted red pepper cannelloni -- as a vegetarian, this was very close to the best dish I've ordered in Madison yet. The wine was perfect, and the service was prompt -- though not too prompt; we wanted to linger over our meal, and not be rushed through it. It won't take us three more years to come back!"""
"Every time I get a loaf of their bread, I come home, cut a slice, and eat it right at the counter. And then I cut another slice, and another. Until I realize that I'm standing in the middle of the kitchen just eating bread. \n\nTheir bread is amazing, and look at ingredients - my kalamata olive loaf had 5 total and I knew them all (water, flour, etc) I don't get the bread sliced at the store and haven't had the moldy problem yet. If I know I won't eat it quickly, I put the bread in a fridge. But it does taste best on the day it's baked.\n\nI haven't tried their pastries but I noticed Turner's milk products in a small fridge and some cheeses in a cooler. Giant Eagle across the street doesn't carry Turner's and East End Coop is a bit far to go for just milk. This place might save you some driving if you need just the basics."
Oh and get the weird maple candy waffles!

I had been looking for a bike shop closer to the Steel Creek area for my Trek Domane 4.5.  I visited Bicycle Sport  and a couple other shops but this place made me feel more comfortabe.

Really Good should food here. Cooked just right. The fried Seafood is the BEST IN TOWN!!! I've been to other so-called Soul Food but none taste like this one! I've order there several times. Price is reasonable.  Only reason it get 4 stars and not 5 is because the decor needs some much needed improvement and a good scrubbing too!
"ok so this is just a lab and as most people have come to expect being branded with a bar code and shuffled through the system .I must say i am really impressed with this lab.The people their were clearly happy and were helpful and actually resembled human beings who have understanding,logic and feelings.So i guess the moral of the story is don't be too quick to judge a process .Sometimes along the way you meet nice caring people who do their jobs with relative happiness in the service of their customers."
"Yes, this is cheap buffet food but it's great for lunches and Friday night dinners. Why? For the selection of food for lunch, where else can the best bang for your buck? There is a great selection of sushi, beef, shrimp, frog legs, and ox tail soup. For me, that's all good enough for something under $10. As for Friday night dinner, there is lobster and crab legs and crawfish here. Now, the lobster is pretty good. The crab legs and crawfish is mediocore. This place is always packed and seats a lot of people. It has the main room and 3 other separate rooms. Why does it get such low reviews from some people, I'm not sure. Did you expect to pay under $10 and get Bellgio or Wynn buffet quality?"
"""The food is truly good here and a mix of authentic Hawaiin and Korean is interesting!  Most people sitting in the crowded restaurant were Korean (that's a first good sign).  They give out free peanuts when you sit down.  Only 2 things I will say about this place is 1) food is pretty salty both with the peanuts, panchan (bean sprouts) and meat.  I tongue was parched and salted like jerky by the end.  2) the prices have gone up!  I was looking at the pictures of the menu on here and the prices have all gone up like $2-$4 each (hence you see a new menu and scratched prices).\n\nOtherwise, the female waitress were a bit sour and unfriendly but the guys were super friendly and awesome.  The one we had was Hawaiian (had the accent and swagger) but looked Korean - there goes that \""""Island fusion style. \"""""""

"Two words: Super Burrito. It may not be as big as your head, but its as big as your late night appetite.  I suggest the steak version without beans.  However, they're very accommodating, so have them throw in some chorizo if you're feeling wiley."

"Great service, clean, dependable, and quick. I had a stripped screw in my air filter housing and I went here with a new filter in hand. Zimbrick Honda quickly removed the screw, installed my filter and had me out the door in 5 minutes with no charge. I'll be using them as my regular oil change location, rather than the quick lube joint that stripped my screw and didn't inform me."
The location is kind of shady but the food is great.  I often get the pierna de puerco asada @ 12.95 I hardly think that the prices are unreasonable.  The chef-owner is Cuban and moved to Las Vegas from Cuba in 1992.   This food is authentic and it is delicious.
"I have been eating El Burrito since it was on Decatur, when we were all super young. That soup is soooo good. The macaroni soup. I used to ask the lady in the old restaurant for the recipe EVERY time. She was so nice, but not nice enough to hand it over. I found that several friends and family have tried to replicate, and fail. Myself, included. I also enjoy there chicken tacos. They wind up become a salad, for me, and that's cool. The cheese enchiladas are super yum. I always get the same things. But the soup? Always. And the staff? We adore the two young men that host and help out. They know there stuff. The only problem I've ever had is that the little space gets so packed! Well, it's my problem for going at prime hours, I supoose. These people can't help it if they freakin love the food! So just get it to go. I will, forever love this place, and if they ever decide to close, please giv me the recipe for the soup. Please."

Usually, I make a trip on Sundays for all day Happy Hour and 2-4-1 growler refills. $11 for 2 64oz jugs of their calico brown is a pretty sweet deal. Just be sure you have Tenaya Creek growlers. They offer a nice selection of draft and the staff provides good customer service. \n\nThey closed the kitchen to use the space for bottling but you can get food delivered or just bring your own. If I'm planning on having more than one brew and staying awhile I usually pick up some grub on the way. I consider the lack of food service to be a positive rather than a negative because I'm not limited to any particular menu at Tenaya. \n\nThe only reason this joint doesn't get 5 stars is the smoke factor. Sometimes it's a non-issue and sometimes it gets pretty smoky in here. It really varies depending on the time of day and the weather. If it's nice out and the patio doors are open it's usually not bad."
"Lulu's is a dependable place to get decent asian food at a pretty cheap price. There's nothing fantastic about any single aspect of the place, but it's good enough and cheap enough to be a mainstay for the university populations."
"I was able to bring my cat and pup in for an appointment within a week of my calling.  Folks were pretty friendly and helpful.  They advised me to come in a bit earlier to fill in paperwork, and I complied, which meant that my pets were seen right at their 4:30 appointment.  They were weighed by the receptionist, initially checked out by a tech, and then finally given a good once over by the vet.  She was helpful and answered my questions about pet foods and meds and the like, and also told me about how they will price match name brand medications (in itself an ok deal, but they didn't carry any generics).  She was also suitably gushy about how gorgeous my animals are.  Standard vet visit (why don't people spill prices on here more often? is it considered rude?) was a bit over $50 per animal.  I wouldn't mind heading somewhere a bit cheaper, but I would balk if the place seemed to provide inferior care and/or service.  Because this place seemed to offer a high caliber of both, I'll likely be back next year for booster shots."
PROS:\nLots of food items & options. \n\nReasonable prices. \n\nGreat service. \n\nCONS:\nCan get a bit crowded at times though.\n\nOnly accepts credit cards with $10 minimum purchase.
Went here last night with my husband and some friends of ours.  Waterworks Cinema is still a decent place to see a show.  It's passed from owner to owner over the years and now I believe  Pittsburgh Theatre Corporation owns it.  I couldn't find a website and I don't believe they have online ticketing.  Still it's a few bucks cheaper than the AMC (what isn't?).
"I didn't actually buy any plants here because I don't have a yard and my balcony is already stuffed with tiny potted seedlings, but if I DID, I would come here to transform my house into a desert oasis! They have a huge selection of trees and flowers and cacti and everything you could imagine.\n\nThere are also BIG, colorful birds everywhere, friendly kitties (one followed us around for a while, and then let us follow him to a nice little nook with an olive tree and fountain), bunnies, humongous tortoises, turtles and even more birds. I think we spent an hour here just exploring. It is totally worth a visit just to wander around!"
"best boba i have tasted in town! hate the wait and the service, but love the boba!"
"""We went to Hanaya Garden today for lunch.  You walk in (past the jewelry, sword, and lucky bamboo sale displays?), order at the counter, and then pick up your entrees once their done.  \n\nWe tried the teriyaki chicken and hibachi shrimp.  Both were made to order, flavorful, came with rice and veggies, and included a side of shrimp sauce for dipping.  Although the entrees were $5.95 and $7.95 respectively, their drinks were cheap ($1.25 with refills) and you don't have to leave a tip because it's self-serve once you order and pick-up your meal.  \n\nWe sat by the makeshift waterfall (I guess that's where the \""""garden\"""" comes in), watched a little of the news on their big screen TV, and wondered whether anyone ever bought any jewelry, swords, or lucky bamboo.  You wouldn't know that it's a retail shop, too, until you walk in; there's nothing outside advertising it.  \n\nSure, it's not high-class Japanese food, but it was fresh made and was enjoyable for a quick lunch."""
"I grew up in the Bay Area eating Round Table Pizza and as a result I am biased. To this day I still think RTP is the BEST pizza you can get - from a pizza chain restaurant anyway. The prices are a little higher for a pie here compared to other chain's - but like anything - you get what you pay for. The toppings are fresh and flavorful, and the bake is just right for my tastes. My favorite pie here is half and half King Arthur's Supreme/Wombo Combo. Ill take an RTP pie ANY DAY over Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Murphy's, Little Caesars, etc!"
"""Fantastic experience!! I took my Audi S5 in for an alignment and to find out where my car was pulling to the right after its was lowered. Clint did an amazing job identifying the problem and taking care of it. Not only was the shop super clean and organized but they clearly explained the problem and even showed me the issue for myself. Extremely  professional and honest which is hard to find these day in the auto repair world. My car feels great, the steering is tight and responsive. I am definitely a customer for life and would highly recomend this shop to anyone in need of honest work. \n\nThanks Joe for hooking up the members in \""""Vegas Audi\"""" to a group discount. \n\nWe all appreciate that."""
"Tried this place during lunch and the wings did not disappoint.  Just the right amount of sauce.  Service was quick, and the waitress did a good job.  Dining area is a little tight and could use some bigger TVs, but this place can stand alone on their wings.  Kind of a strange patio dining area out front."
REAL Chicago Italian  Beef sandwich!!!!  Done RIGHT!!!   Amazing!!! Have searched high and low and been met with such disappointment. Today I was so pleasantly amazingly shocked!!!  For a little while I was sitting at Wrigleyville Tap having a beef!!!  Thank you Brewery! I'll be back!!!  Tonight and tomorrow and the day after that!!!
Love the food - not a fan of the atmosphere though.  The blueberry pancakes with the orange butter are fabulous and have completely changed the way I make pancakes at home.  I also love the breakfast sandwich - so good!  The one thing I don't like about the place is how loud it is - the acoustics of the place just seem to amplify everything and it gets too loud for me to really enjoy if it's super busy.
"I came in right at opening time on Saturday morning. The donuts looked fresh and so beautifully unreal. I had a maple old fashioned and it was PERFECT. Some O/F donuts are too dry, or too moist almost tasting uncooked. Real Donuts gets it JUST RIGHT! I bought 3dozen assorted for my co-workers and will turn. These donuts are delicious and priced well."
"Looking at the reviews I don't know if we are talking about the same place.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at this place.  Dozens of Omelet's to choose from.  Our server was quick and attentive.  The layout of the place is nothing to be desired, but they left a couple pictures up to let people know they were proud Chicago transplants.\n\nAfter exploring their vast menu I had the Californian.  They offer spuds or hash browns I decided on the spuds.  When the food came I noticed they did not skimp on portions.  The spuds were great some were crispy which I love, and the omelet was delicious.  I really had a great experience enough so that I will be back."
"This place is just what you want in an inspection spot. They were fast (came in at 4:55ish on a Monday, they were done at 5:08), friendly (the office girl was polite and efficient) and fair (no trumped up issues). Who really cares if a waiting room is sparsely furnished, I'm there to get in and out and get my car inspected. Exactly what I was looking for."
"My favorite boba place in Vegas. If you get some drinks to go, they come out pretty fast. The quality of their drinks is fantastic you can tell that they make their boba every morning. I love getting their milk teas because the tea is really good quality and their boba is perfect. Their other drink toppings aren't that great though. If you're used to pudding in your drink from places in CA, their pudding will let you down.\n\nIf you sit in, the service is slow and the waiters are don't really pay attention to you. If you're not in a rush then it's not too big of a deal. Bottomline is that this is still the best place to get boba in this city."
"I was diagnosed diabetic in 2000.  I chose to visit Shearing-Westfield (as it was known then) because it was on a very short list of ophthalmologists in the company insurance directory, and it was the closest to home.  NO NEED TO LOOK FURTHER!  Front office staff, medical support staff, and doctors are all first-rate, professional, friendly, and just all-around nifty.  My wife has a history of eye injuries, and the personnel and services we both experienced have been superlative.  Due to the variety of services, examinations and tests available, any given patient may have to move from one area of the facility to another, but all this under one roof ... I could not think of a better organization.  Bravo, people."
"Yum, yum, yum!  I wasn't even sure this place was open when I drove by it the first 1000 times but we finally decided to go in and give it a shot while getting the oil changed down the street.  Well worth it!  I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich and it was a MOUND of chicken with thier special jaco sauce on a bun with lettuce and tomato.  Definitely plenty...I couldn't eat it all.  The jaco sauce...which I was told contained soy, pineapple juice, honey, and worchestire sauce....tasted more like watered down soy all by itself.  It was so salty!  For my side, I had cheese grits and they were creamy, delicious, and a little spicy thanks to what I think were some green chiles.  All in all, good stuff, but next time, I will get the sauce on the side.  Oh!  For vegetarians, this is a dream....they have at least 10 veggies on their side menu, plus specials of the day.  Veggie plates all around!"
"Best smog expereince I've ever had and I've been doing several cars for many years.  Polite and extremely fast.  Great coupons, at the moment, on both Craigslist and the Smog King website.\n\nUnless something changes, I won't ever go anywhere else."
"""Gay cowboys, rambunctious line dancing, and $5 pitchers of beer. I really don't know what else I could ask for! It's a good place to drink copious amounts and channel your inner dancing queen without judgement. (Trust me, regardless of what you're doing/wearing, you CANNOT compete with that 6'2\"""" drag queen grinding against the mirror.) \n\nAs a woman, I like going to a bar where I don't have to worry about drunk losers trying to hit on me. If you like country music, get here before midnight. Otherwise, club music starts at 12 and that's when the top 40s playlist will start going...think Lady Gaga, Beyonce, etc. \n\nJust be prepared. It's a loud, big, gay bar, and the men here are brave. People rip off their shirts and start getting pretty wild on the dance floor. If you can handle that, you'll have a good time."""
"Omelet House was pretty good I have to say. Any omelet you choose is going to taste good but be aware that the portions are HUGE. So if you're a small person or don't have a big appetite - share. \n\nMust have some banana bread. It comes out fresh and hot from the oven, so soft and moist. I would go there just to eat that. \n\nI must say that driving up to Omelet House had me a little worried because from the outside it looks a little sketchy and even the decor on the inside is kinda iffy but I guess that doesn't matter when the food comes out. Service was friendly also."
"""Ditto to Amy B's review.  What more can be said?  Really.  She pretty much summed up the experience we had.  I took a group of boys here for my son's birthday and we had a blast.\n\nMy only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, there were a lot of younger kids there for multiple birthday parties.  I can see grouping them together.  But, there were also groups of much older kids, young adults really, that were obviously there for a serious death match competition.  The staff did a good job of mixing up the teams to try and keep things fair but, there were just too many  bigger people rampaging around and the younger kids didn't get to enjoy it - they were being zapped mercilessly and spent most of their time being dead.  Come on guys, really?\n\nIf you're an older \""""kid\"""" and go here, give the younger kids a break, okay?  It's dark, loud, they're half your size and constantly being knocked over or pushed into walls.  Let them enjoy it, too."""
Is this the best Chinese restaurant in the area? No.. but is it the best Chinese restaurant that delivers in the area? Definitely. If you want a Chinese take out in the University area that has better than average food and speedy service this is definitely the one to choose. Now with online ordering as well? Even better. I've only ever ordered food delivered from them but the majority of times the food was good. \n\nI've tried others that deliver in the area (with decent Yelp ratings) and was always disappointed by things like mushy overcooked rice and lukewarm food at best.\n\nFor this area of the city? This is the Chinese delivery that seems to have the most consistently decent food and service.
I know 4 stars? You're probably thinking I'm crazy for going away from the pack of the 5 star yelpers. This is a wonderful old school hardware store and a local business in Matthews. If you're looking to walk around downtown Matthews on a Saturday this is a great spot to just walk in and check out. Love the hardwood floors! \n\nThe reason for the 4 stars is because my husband and I went to purchase a spray bottle and it was behind the counter the person who was running the register rang it up and it was $13! To me that's way over priced for a spray bottle.\n\nSo my advice is if you are looking to purchase from a family run business and are ok with shelling out some cash go for it! This place is a real gem of Matthews!
"Gibson's might be the best kept secret in Charlotte. I grew up going to Gibson's with my parents in the 80's and Reece (the owner) was really hard to understand (because of a speech impediment) but he worked hard and you always knew he'd take good care of your car. Sometimes you'd have to wait but the characters there would always keep you laughing. Now Larry Gibson (Reece's son) runs the shop and he's a real stand up guy.\n\nBasically, it's the place to go for quality car service. Unlike many other service centers you really feel like the workers give you advice based on what they would do if they were getting their car fixed. I have a Firestone service center 5 minutes from me and I still drive 25 minutes to go to Gibson. \n\nNext time you need an oil change or tires fixed give them a try."
Not a big fan of Mexican food. But since I'm here in Phoenix I gotta try it. The food was very good. The server was friendly. Would definitely recommend this place. Big portion though.
"I am giving this vet 5 stars because Dr. Kay is great!!  You know how sometimes with check-ups, you feel rushed and not all your questions are answered completely?  Not with Dr. Kay.  She provided us with so much information about our cats (specifically about their diet and how to clean their teeth)  She gave us several different samples of new foods that we can try with our two cats.  She was very clear on the options we have for our one cat who has to get a tooth removed.  I really appreciated her thoroughness and passion for really taking great care of our pets.  I would highly recommend Dr. Kay to anyone.  Visit their website - free check-ups for your pet on your first visit!"
I must say since Sears took over they did a good job with Kmart. The prices aren't bad. From TV's to housewares. They seem to carry higher end products than Walmart. The furniture is of higher quality too. Picked up a nice real wood kitchen table. Its like a mini Sears. It was 8pm and only 3 cashiers were working. They still have layaway and implemented a rewards card program. If more people shop here it will knock Walmart off its high horse. I will be back.
"I had no idea that this was a sister restaurant to Harris Grill until I stepped inside. It is a refreshing change from the rest of Mount Washington, in that you know you will be treated well no matter what you are wearing. While I definitely enjoy a nice meal and am willing to pay the price for it, I feel like many (but not all) of the places on Mount Washington charge for the view, rather than the food. Shiloh is a relatively inexpensive option, with very friendly staff and a great drink menu. The venue is also nice, and if you do want to see that view that people pay money for at other restaurants, I recommend walking along Grandview. The view is better on foot than from any restaurant anyways!"
This place has my favorite rib tips and side bread. The price is very reasonable and they serve a large amount of food for their price. I didn't give it a five because the restaurant is small and kind of dirty. So I do take puts for most of them times.
"This is the only spot that David X will go in the QC. All of the unpretentious charm of a classic barber shop - and the guy actually knows how to cut thick, unruly Asian hair! $16 bucks for a cut and clean up.  The place is a small charmer. They also sell pecans, FYI."
super cheap beer and deep fried pretzels. what else do you need?
"The best brake guy in las vegas. Honest reliable and truthfully the easiest person to deal with. Mark and his staff of mechanics are the most knowledgable people I know in his field. Super patient with people like myself who know absolutely know nothing about cars. \n\nIf you have rotor problems, suspension problems or any brake problems call Mark aka DR Brake! \n\nMy brakes were making a duh duh duh sound and i got it back sounding like new!"
"I joined Pinnacle for their group fitness classes and they're great.  I have never used the other equipment or pool area though since I have both at my apartment facility nearby-- so I can't speak to that.  But the group instructors are wonderful, and not many other places offer awesome classes like BodyCombat!"
OMG this little place was BomB... sorry no pic's. they didn't last long to capture any. So good when your finished your Like Damn I forgot to take pic's... Had the westerns by the way :D
"why the 5 stars?\n\n-SUPERB customer service\n-everything i want and need is always in stock\n-minutes away from the pad\n-healthy and affordable \n-neat, clean, and organized\n-get entered in a raffle every week for a $25 gift card if you bring your own bag. \n\ni am also a HUGE whole foods market fan as well. because they support the local farmers and vendors, sometimes i am unable to find certain items when traveling from city to city. trader joe's shelves are always stocked with the same items. i appreciate the consistency throughout the stores. \n\nnot knocking wfm by any means, i support local anything. i just appreciate and love when i can find a certain craved item in any town. mahalo joe! =)"
"Man, this place was da bomb.com. I have to take a dump cause this place is like so so def wit that fresh fresh salat. keeps me rugalurrr as heyaaalllll!!\nNo, but really this place is great. The ice cream is a wonderful suprise at the end. I would give it 5 stars but it didn't have sprinkles.\n\nCJ"
"Ok, so I finally found a suitable Jamaican restaurant worthy enough of my review. I've tried Royal Caribbean in East Liberty and I have to give a C grade. Been that I'm from DC I'm used to A+ Jamaican but Fireside gets a B+. I had the Oxtail with rice and peas and it as a lot of food and very good. Its located in Wilkinsburg on Penn and Center st right across from the Historic Penn-Lincoln hotel  which might be why you can never find it when you search for it on Yelp. Their service was fast and courteous and very respectful. They only take cash which is ok because Pamela's do the same thing. Overall I enjoyed the food. I know Wilkinsburg gets a bad wrap but don't worry about the neighborhood, I've eaten in worse places in DC and most hole in the wall places make the best food. Check it out. I'm a Grad Student at Pitt so my word is golden. Have fun."
"""I was happy to see the handwritten signs had been recently removed from the walk-up window.  If you are going to repost the information that was previously up on the signs, how about condensing all the information into one professionally made sign?  Would you consider renewing the menu on the wall--just freshening up the color, at least?  I realize my following suggestion would be a significant expense, but it would be a \""""one-time\"""" expense (requiring touch-up once in a great while), and I think it would greatly enhance the cult status of your shop:  How about a frozen custard/ice-cream themed mural all across that wall?!?  A frozen custard wonderland--something Wizard of Oz-ish!  Your place would be truly amazing!\n\nMaybe I don't have the right to make these suggestions because I'm not donating to them, but I'm a native Las Vegan, I love your shop, and I recommend it to everyone when the topic of desserts, namely frozen treats, comes up--especially to people from up north.  Please give my suggestions some consideration.  I just want to see your business live up to its total potential and really shine!  Thank you."""
"Fabulous - took them a $300 sweater with large red wine stain, got it back in 2 days like new! Only cost $3.75!"
"We were seated immediately on the late side on a Sunday for dinner though the place was packed and ordered the following, all off the Sichuan menu:\ndan dan noodles\nshredded potatoes and green chili peppers (these look like nothing when they arrive but they taste like salty french fries but w/o the crunch!)\nshredded pork with garlic sauce\n\nGood food/service so no complaints here.\n\nLeftovers tasted just as good the next day, and it appeared people like to do take out too."
"Five stars simply because there are so few cool places in CLT! Nice little market where you can get knick knacks, some food, some drink. Little outdoor are between two buildings has a cozy, alley feel. You can crack open that beer out there, too. The writing all over the wall is kind of lame, but hey, these Charlotteans need all the outlets they can get in this buttoned up southern banking town."
I can't believe that there aren't more reviews for this location!  I've been coming here since I was a boy.  Simply the best and freshest bread in all of Pittsburgh.  Nothing even comes close.
"I came in for water and stayed for the food.\n\nThe list of food items is quite small, about 6 dishes, but they all looked good.  I went with a scrambled egg sandwich with a garlic spread, thick slices of bacon, on a homemade biscuit.  \n\nI remember my mom making homemade biscuits one time, but then stopped because it took forever to make.  Boy, did I forget what a difference making biscuits from scratch is!  The bacon was that thick meaty bacon, and not that fatty icky stuff.  It was def hog heaven.  \n\nJust be sure when you're stuffing your face with your biscuit sandwich that your friend doesn't walk by and catch you with garlic spread on your face....not like that happened to me or anything  :)"
"Such a pleasure to deal with. If your heat or air goes out these are the people you want to do business with. They were recommended through word of mouth, I like that in a business because you know someone else was a happy customer. They were timely, efficient and honest (we knew what was broken because HomeDepot, who we thought we had a warranty with came out looked gave us a price and charged us 79 dollars for a service call) \nKen was the serviceman who came to my house, he spoke very highly of the company he worked for, and he was very nice and professional, he checked out the unit diagnosed the problem explained it to me and told me someone would come back tomorrow with the part to fix the unit. As promised he came back, at the time promised with a call he was on the way. They have been around for a long time that in itself says something :)"
"Who writes these 500 word reviews?  Take a course in editing!  Anyway, this place is very nice with comfortable decor, great staff, and fine food.  It's nice for lunch.  Watch out for Friday night.  It's busy so get there early or later."
"This is the kind of place you want to support, you want to see survive.\n\nWhile I was living in CU, it closed down a few times, but always came back to life.\n\nIt has been said the food is hit or miss - I agree. But I think more times than not - it is delicious and filling.\n\nI always did my best to try something new and was usually left feeling warm and satisfied."
"Probably closer to 3.5 stars but I rounded up to 4 stars since chicken and waffles is not a food type that I expected to find in the desert. The food is tasty enough and I would expect that LoLo's is the finest chicken and waffles joint in Arizona.\n\nI spend a lot of time in Atlanta on business where chicken and waffles is considered an art form so I'm spoiled by Gladys Knight!\n\nSeriously, the waffles are delicious!  Some of the best that I've had anywhere...  I'm not sure what is going on with the frozen butter/crisco on the waffles but I could do without it.\n\nThe chicken is pretty good but it is fairly greasy....  I had the chicken fried chicken and it was a solid offering topped with sausage gravy.\n\nI wanted to try the banana pudding but I succumbed to the chicken, waffles, chicken fried chicken, corn bread, rice/beans,etc...  You won't leave here hungry!"
"My dog needed to her shots, I called Craig Road Animal Hospital and was told I did not need an appointment and I could come right in.  And I did!  There was a short wait, maybe 15 minutes.  But the place was clean and the staff friendly.  My pet and I were happy.  I had a good feeling about this place and didn't see any red flags.  I had planned to board my dog someplace else, but canceled that reservation to board with CRAH. I am looking for a long and happy relationship with CRAH."
"Under new ownership and two new changes make the HUGEST difference in the quality of the food: the grill is regularly cleaned and the ingredients are fresh. The menu is essentially the same as far as I can tell, with the same low prices, but I have trouble convincing friends how much better the food tastes! Mainly because for the last handful of years we could only brave the place when hangovers had numbed our tastebuds. Now the food is good, the coffee is great, the grill is clean and there's a friendly face in the kitchen. Love it!"
"2 fritters will fit in box for a dozen donuts, nuf said. incredible."
Fixed my tire and no charge:)\nFlamingo location said we can't fix it!\nTy Lake Mead!!!!
"I foregoed my favorite prime rib pasta today for a rack of bbq ribs and, kicking my fingers,  I was not disappointed.  It's been almost a year since I tried their ribs and were still just as falling off the bones, melt in your mouth delightful as I remembered. A lead off dish tonight was spinach and artichoke dip,  which the me,  has improved, a close second to my all time favorite spinach and artichoke dip.   Service was impeccable,  and I don't say that too often,  worthy of the 30% tip I happily rendered.....  I'll be back soon O'charleys,"
Oh how nice to find a great locals bar.\nSeems intimidating because lots of bikers seem to go there but WOW not at all. \nBartenders are awesome! Always checking in to see if not only you are ok but anyone around you.. I was quite surprised how friendly everyone was. The female staff dresses a little provocative but they are just lovely and fun. Great Place!!!!
"""Let me start off by saying I've been here several times and reason being? Food Network of course...so I got the BBQ Mahi Tacos as always and they were delicious! I love the crunchy slaw with the tender Mahi Mahi and the white cilantro sauce. \n\nService was ok (that's why I took off a star). Our waitress was flustered even though it wasn't that busy. She forgot to bring more chips & salsa after being asked an excessive three (3) times. Not to mention the station to get the chips & salsa was right beside our table; So we repeatedly saw her walk past it but we still didn't get it until asking the 4th time. She also took a while to bring our beers and we could see the bar from where we were sitting.  Also, the hostess @ the door had a mild \""""stank-a**\"""" demeanor that I didn't appreciate. O_o"""
"Overall great experience. We chose to rent from this Enterprise outlet that's 5 extra minutes away from the big Las Vegas Airport Rental Center, because we could have a weeks rental for $135 instead of $345. Ridiculous discrepancy, but easy pick-up to the further outlet & big savings.\nFewer cars to choose from, but we found a nice Elantra that was super-smooth to drive. Only reason for taking off a star is they re-registered the car for the coming year, but forgot to put the 2015 sticker on the license plate. So the plates looked expired and we got pulled over by the cops for it. Once the cop checked and saw it was indeed current, we were on our way. And the very friendly & accommodating salesman immediately apologized, took off a day's rental cost, and quickly replaced the old sticker with the new at a quick trip back to their office. Making sure the plates are current is an important professional point to miss when examining their cars, so one star off...otherwise, ideal."
"This place is great. Young crowd, cheap drinks ($1.50 select beers and $5 pitchers, can't beat that). I wouldn't come here for dinner, it's more of a dive bar than a restaurant. Definitely loud, crowded and messy which is not always a bad thing."
"Great cold subs, but I will take Penn station over this any day!"
What can I say. It is close to the house and is as convenient as it gets. They usually have what I need and work to keep the place clean. The workers there are nice and friendly and have always helped me out with all my questions.
"$hit, this place was awesome back in 2004 when i was in school there.  $5 for an overloaded container of dumplings with hot sauce and sour cream.  I got to know the owner because i was always in there and he'd get me to the front of the long line every time.\n\nOne time i came by right after they closed and knocked on the window and he let me and my buddy in while they closed up.  He served us a huge portion and when they finished closing shop, he brought out a bottle of vodka shaped like a tommy gun and shared it with us.  \n\nThey had a sweet record collection too.  Sorry to hear they closed."

Lebanon Mineo's location!!  Sadly, they deliver too and I have put a few pounds on because of it!! Lol\n\nFor 13 years I seriously tried to get Joe and Dominic to allow me to open up a franchise, first in Maryland and then New Orleans.....that's how great their pizza and other menu items are!!"""
"There are a few things that are tough about this place: street parking, cash only, cinderblock exterior, and their drinks are so good it means their food gets some so-so reviews by comparison.\nI've found their food to be quite yummy, and I enjoy the relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere. Apparently they have a lovely deck for summer outdoor dining, too.\nThey are known for their great drinks, however, so you can't skip those. Just make sure you have both cash and a designated driver, as you'll want to try a couple and linger a while :)"
"""Rosati's is my favorite pizza in the Madison area.  There's something magical about the sauce, cheese, and their italian sausage (we roll simple in my household)...  Very few pizzas give me that satisfying \""""hunger quenching\"""" feeling that Rosati's gives me.  Unfortunately, that leads to the problem of not knowing when to stop!  But that's my problem, not theirs...\n\nI've carried out for lunch as well as ate in with the family.  I've never been disappointed!  The kids love it.  I love it.  My extended family loves it.  It's awesome.  The grab-and-go lunch options are nice too (I work nearby)."""
"For an inexpensive restaurant similar to chilis and applebees, this restaurant actually had pretty good food.  The only reason I dont give 5 starts for this visit is the waiter took 10 mins to even introduce himself and take our drink order.  I do think I was seated right at shift-change though.  \n\nI was surprised that the prices increased from what I remember, but I would still prefer going here over any other restaurant of the type. (I usually only waste my time going out to a restaurant if I know it will be worth it since I usually cook better than the restaurant.)  Kudos to TGI Friday's for this visit."
"Ive been seeing Dr. Z for years and hes great. \nI love that he only does GYN this means you always \nget to see your doctor. I've been to many GYN that do OB \nas well its very frustrating to have your MD be unavailable \nfor various amounts of times b/c of deliveries. You \nnever have that with Dr. Z. Additionally his bedside manner is\nTOPS. As long as he's practicing, i'll be there!"
"I've been here a couple of times, both times the service was good, and the atmosphere was calm (When it was next to the Holiday Inn).  They serve up some Italian food classics in a cloth napkin kind of a place.  I have to drop it down a notch because the second time I went, I was sadly disappointed by the main dish.  The bread and oil and salad appetizers were very very good, so much so that I even asked for the bread and oil to go!!  They did give me a replacement main meal and credited my dinner, but it was still sad to go so sharply downhill after the delish beginnings of the meal.  Now it looks as the door has shut on Abruzzi's and it has been replaced by Amalfi's, so look for a review soon to see if it shapes up on the Italian food front."
"It makes me beyond happy that they are conscientious of the way a woman's body is presented, which is why they take all of the vibrators out of the box and screen their video selection.  The staff will make you feel right at ease and answer any questions that you may have... and if you're still shy they have an amazingly helpful well-organized website.  I have a friend who hosts those naughty parties, and I always decline because if I have any needs they are met 100% by A Woman's Touch."
"The East Blvd. location does need it's own review because it is a pretty exceptional location. With ample comfortable seating an open spaces it is easy to relax and read, get work projects done, or chat with friends.\nThe staff always seems to be among the best no matter who they hire.\nWatch where you park. The huge lot actually does not have many space for Starbucks and if you park wrong, you are almost guaranteed to find a boot or your car towed. Can't find a designated space? Don't chance it, park on the street or circle around until someone leaves."
Very nice staff. Close location to the strip (driving) very thorough job. Great pricing. Made an appointment and didn't have to wait. Only reason I gave them 4 stars in stead of 5 is because I felt there nail polish selection could have been better and while they were clean I felt the overall salon could have looked cleaner.
"I ordered chicken chow fun for dinner today. Relatively authenic Cantonese dish. It's a little more gravy-ish and saltier than I was expecting but overall delicious. Tender chicken and good portion size. It's a little pricey but I figured it's the Midwest. I didn't see hong kong style milk tea on the menu - so sad, oh well. It's much better than hong kong wok!"
"I love L'il Porgy's. I've gone here since I was a kid, and have always ordered the same thing. 1/2 chicken special. Only difference is that I eventually graduated from mild to hot sauce! I personally don't think waiting 30-40 minutes for a table at Black Dog is worth it when Porgy's is within walking distance and is no frills as BBQ should be. Black dog you can keep your fancy local beers and exotic hipster BBQ sauces. I'll skip the side of pretension and stay loyal to Porgy's!"
"Fun little place. Hard to find parking so I like to take the trolley train thing (whatever it is called) to downtown. When we went, there were groups that were trying to get us to take their bus to go on a loop or to other locations (free of charge but a tip for the driver). We ran into a group that was doing a mustache party so it was awkward to be drinking next to someone with a Hitler stache. It was a mixture of rowdy bar-hopping groups and quiet little pockets in the bar where you could sit and talk if needed. Standard selection of Irish beers."
I've had three different landlords in Madison and McBride is hands down the absolute best there is. I lived at 699 W Mifflin for 2 years. Any maintenance requests are taken care of in less than 24 hours. They are not shady and do a great job at maintaining the quality of the apartments. They're super nice and don't charge you for superfluous reasons just to get money out of you. HIGHLY recommended!!
Buttermilk donuts! That's all I go there for.
"Customer service!  Someone still has it this day in age!  After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me over at Dillard's, I simply gave up, walked into Nordstrom, and purchased the same pair of shoes in no time flat!  To the employee who helped me:  Hats off to you good sir!"
"Little pricey but good contemporary furniture and the woman who helped me was really nice and not pushy at all. Good deals during the floor sale.  They also delivered exactly when they said they would, despite a major snow storm."
Nice little spot to grab a burger or spicy chicken sandwich.  Get there early for lunch though because the lines can get long.
"As the recession has deepened, people's style of dress has declined in step; therefore, you can bring out your tasteless graffiti clad T shirts & fit right in now."
"""Chain pharmacy stores are about as interesting as life insurance policies, but this Walgreens has \""""it\"""".  By \""""it\"""", I mean attentive customer service, well-organized shelves, and good deals.\n\nI'm not fan of getting my Rx filled, but the Walgreens chain allows you to request refills online and sign up for regular refills.  You just show up the window and a few seconds later, you're off to medicated bliss. \n\nI don't normally buy anything in pharmacies other than my Rx, but Walgreens has some suprisingly good deals on housewares, typical drug store merch, and as-seen-on-TV products.If I look lost, the staff are always asking, \""""Can I help you find something?\"""".   Come on...you know you secretly want a Sham WOW or a Slap Chop!  Their sales don't require that frivolous \""""savings\"""" (re:tracking) card like other pharmacies and the values are much deeper, like buy one, get one free on my fav. hair gel.  And they have a RedBox, woo hoo!\n\nMy only complaint is that this store closes at 10 PM.  But for fast-friendly service and good deals on about everything, Walgreens is the jam."""
"Clean, well stocked, and very efficient check-out - far better than my 'normal' Von's and nearly as convenient when you take into account the lack of having to venture into Boca Park.  Prices trend a bit higher than Wal-Mart and non-organic vegetables are sometimes limp, but by-and-by a quality grocery store with good  prices and all the essentials."
"I worked with Abra Auto Body on fixing my car after filing a claim with AAA. I had an absolute pleasure working with them for many reasons: they daily updated me on the status of work on my car (so never did I have to wonder on what is going on), they did an absolutely quality work on fixing all the damages and they did it on time! Very pleasant customer service and I highly recommed this place!"
"Ever think back to your early 20s?  You know, when you were single and had your first apartment?  When you did your own budgeting and your own grocery shopping for the first time?  Ever look back at the neighborhood you lived in & the places you went?  \n\nMe, I lived in Greenfield from the time I was 23 up 'til I got married at age 27.  I used to satisfy my pizza cravings here and I remember it being great pizza at an absolutely hole-in-the-wall place.  I'm proud to say, it hasn't changed a bit. Rick and I just wanted some takeout for dinner and since I was looking back at some of my old reviews, I thought we'd check out Conicella once again.\n\nM-m-m-m!  Greasy, yummy, bad-for-you pizza!  We ordered the white pizza with sausage, hot peppers & mushrooms on it.  Terrific!  Especially if you're like me and you fold your slice as you eat it.  I know my Chicago friends are cringing at the thought of eating it that way!"
"Cleveland has record stores but Cleveland has nothing like Jerry's.  Holy crap!  This a vinyl lovers paradise.  You could seriously spend an entire day in this place.  I found tons of imports all at really reasonable prices.  I collect mostly 80's and 90's alternative and found stuff I hadn't seen in years, mostly at around $4.00 or $5.00 a pop and in pristine condition.\n\nJerry and his staff were very knowledgeable and super friendly too.  The store is completely overwhelming with the amount of vinyl they have.  You could go back and find something you missed time and time again I am assuming.  The only downside is they don't take credit cards HOWEVER they have an ATM which makes up for it."
Pricey for portion size...but extremely good food & service
"I've been a loyal customer for 3 years. Phenomenal on time service with great products and quality. They know me by name, great personal service, and absolutely willing to satisfy orders. Best example: I needed lilacs for my fianc\u00e9e in October. Every florist around said there was nothing to be done. These guys said they'll make it work. For a reasonable price, I had a bushel of lilacs shipped from Holland five days after order. You can't ask for that type of service"
"If I give Draft House Big Dogs 5 stars, the Big Dogs on Sahara deserves a 4 star review at least.  The beer is brewed at the Draft House location on Rancho, but its just as fresh here.  In fact, when the special brews run out at the Draft House, you can often find them here or at the Nellis location for another week or two.\n\nThe bar food is good too.  The menu is slightly different, but pretty much the same as the Draft House.  The only thing is that sometimes the restaurant has slow service on weekends.  This never used to be a problem, but lately when I have gone it has been.  However, after a few Dirty Dog IPA's, this is easily forgiven.  \n\nTry the cheese curds, and the philly cheese steak sandwich.  The fries are awesome too.  Overall, this smaller version of the Draft House has the best beer brewed in Las Vegas (at their Rancho location), and pretty darn good bar food.  This is a regular hang out for me and my coworkers."
"I came here for the strawberry chicken, since that's a dish I seldom see at Chinese restaurants.  It was good; the chicken pieces were made of white meat with a crunchy outside, but the strawberry sauce wasn't as good as I've experienced elsewhere.  Still, I feel this is a quality restaurant, so I will be returning in time."
"""I travel for work a fair bit. In some cities it's easy to find tasty, unique (non-chain) places to eat; others not so much. So, when my colleague said, \""""I heard about a brew pub in an old church,\"""" my response was, \""""Say no more--I am SO there.\""""\n\nIt did not disappoint.\n\nWas it mind-blowingly delicious food? No, but it was tasty and enjoyable as far as road food goes. \nWas it the most amazing beer I've ever had? I don't know--I'm not exactly a beer snob.\nWas it a great place to kick back some beers with a colleague and a business partner? Definitely.\n\nSure beat eating in the hotel restaurant, or a mega-chain which is guaranteed to be uninspired and uninspiring fare.\n\nAs we left, I noticed they have a veggie patch out back. It's too early in the season for me to benefit from that garden, but I'm sure it makes its way to the table later in the summer, and that earns them an extra star in my book."""
"My family has used Gibson's for many years. I have always been happy with the service I received, and their prices were much lower than dealership quotes. \n\nThe guys there have always taken the time to explain any repairs and give different options with NO PRESSURE! As a female who has no understanding of car repairs, I really appreciate having trustworthy folks to leave my ride with!  They do not have Saturday hours, but that isn't enough for me to take off a star from my review in this case."
"""The 2 hot dog combo is a great deal - Chicago-style dogs are so expensive around here, so 2 dogs, really good fries and a drink for $6 works for me.  I also tried the Italian Beef and it was just right - just like home.  Our service was excellent both times we've visitied.  I would go five stars, but this weekend my wife ordered the \""""double dough\"""" pizza and I tried it - pretty disapointingly dry bland crust.  I'm certainly going to try the deep-dish sometime...maybe I'll change my review after that - 5star if it's great and down to 3 if it stinks."""
"We had to stop during a 14 hour road trip with two kids. The guys at this jiffy were so friendly and fast, we were back on the road in 15 minutes as promised. Not usually one I write a review for an oil change, but these guys were exceptional."
"This place is truly a gift to Wisconsinites and women in general! \nI am gonna knock it down for overly-90s style, some cheesiness and...well not enough kink-gear for my taste. I want to feel at ease buying my boi underwear!\n\nThat said, the staff is extremely friendly and casual, the environment is fun and easy the be in. This is the place my Quaker/religious/unitarian group took me to learn about sex at age 13. That is how socially appropriate it is. Only healthy, happy, consensual, safe sex here! And that's the way it should be."
"""The only reason I'm giving CCO 4 stars is because of its products and the variety of them. They have MAC, Clinique, Lancome and other namebrand skincare, makeup, and parfumes for few dollars cheaper. \n\nGranted the MAC products are from last season but, all of MAC's products are just a slight change of color from one blue/green/pink/etccc to another (most of the time)..they just change the names. \n\nThe best thing I've found there was that they have Clinque's infamous daily moisturizer lotion and gel...THAT STUFF IS GOLD! I told the cashier I was shocked to see that they sold that and she said they sell out of them quick but, they do carry 'em.\n\n\nThe only negative which is a BIG negative in retail is that the customer service SUCKKKKSSSSSS BIG BALLLLLSSSSS --- No \""""hi.\"""" No \""""bye.\"""" Sometimes, I don't even get a \""""thank you.\"""" ---- REALLY??! \n\nAgain. The only reason for the 4 stars are the products!"""
"Very good tailor!  I had a dress made for me in Nigeria and it was a TAD tight.  Also bought some jeans that were supposed to be skinny, but weren't, and were a bit long.  He handled both very well.\n\nHe is also quite friendly, which makes it even better."
Not health food but worth the 20 minutes of life you lose by eating there.  The food is stick to your ribs delicious. Fried Chicken great. Waffles Great. Fried Okra great.  You need to get there around 11:00 if you expect to sit down right away so if you go later expect to wait.
"Service was excellent. The place reminded me of pizzerias on long island (where I'm from). Being from NY is a gift and a curse being that I can't find good pizza most of the time. \n\nFor like 20 bucks (thank you yelp check in deal) we fed our family of 5. That right there is pretty sweet. \nThe garlic knots were a little harder and dryer than liked, but my kids still liked them.they brought them out before the pizza which I appreciate. \n\nWe got half pep have cheese. Perfect amount of grease, cheese didn't slide right off (hate that). It was really delicious. \n\nWill definitely return when in Vegas."
"This place looks like it's a million years old, but the service and food are awesome.  \n\nHad the eggs benedict, the they throw on some kind of seasoning that's like paprika and parsley over everything.  Tasted real yum.  Their potatoes are off the hook.  Banana nut bread is really good, pumpkin is ok.  Waffle is nice and large, too.  There is a lobster version of eggs benedict which is supposed to be the bomb but I have a seafood allergy so no thanks.\n\nBe careful of how much you order - don't order 3-4 things like I do even if they sound/look good.  Great for a bunch of hungry guys.  Not far from strip.  Travelers will feel welcome.\n\nBig parking lot."
"My first time here, I saw that it was a very homey feeling. Every inch of space in the store was used and did not waste any. An awesome selection of beer that you can't find anywhere else, that was the first place I browsed. I drank the Aventinus which was absolutely delicious (and at 8.2% alc. content it got me where I wanted to be.) The only small problem I feel was that the seating was limited and parking was also limited. I think this only applies to the wintertime because it's too cold to go outside to drink.\n\nI have heard raving reviews and talk about their deli, but sadly when I went there it was closed and I didn't get the chance to go and try their food. They definitely have an amazing amount of beer food where it accompanies your drink. I found that really useful as my friends and I did buy some snacks to eat. I will definitely be back here for their free beer sampling."
"I was looking for a good diner for breakfast, and it fits the bill.  Sodas are in a can, and kind of pricey considering that, so coffee or tea is a better drink.  Food was quick, hot and tasty (though sadly the bacon was only ok), and my waitress was attentive.  The decor is not fancy, but that's fine with me, as everything was clean that I saw, and that counts more.  If you want solid simple food that fills you up in a similar setting, this is your place."
"This place is a good choice for Vietnamese. It's a fast, cheap, hole in the wall. Nothing fancy about it. Just good food. I may have had more flavorful broth at other Vietnamese restaurants like Ben Thanh next door and Vietnam Grille on South Blvd."
"The COF made it soooo easy to tie the knot!\nThere was no anxiety or anything like that, just direct, prompt sercive.\nThe chapel itself was cute and quaint...\nNo one had an attitude...\n\nOnly issues, the limo was a bit late, but he called 3x with status updates (which was awesome).....and the minister was a little bit cheesy....he told James to buy me Tiffany's during the ceremony....clearly he doesn't know me; i buy JAMES Tiffany's!! haha :)\n\nAnyhow, it was great, and it was a lot of fun!!\nAnd it's pretty reasonable for having an actual wedding/ceremony!\n\nI recommend!\n\nxo-\nandrea"
"I'll have a three rolled beef with guacamole combo, cheese quesadilla with guac, some chicken tacos, and extra quac. Thank you. That is all."
solid bbq not great but never been dissapointed very good burnt ends good burgers if someone in group doesn't wan't bbq like the beans and cornbread good kids meals at ressonable prices my kids love that they come with oreos have always had solid service prices on par with other bbq joints like the variety of sauce choices hubby loves the blues music they play
"I mean, where else will you see good bands in town? High Dive is pretty good (see St. Vincent). Krannert is kind of stuffy (although Ra Ra Riot was pretty awesome there.) I've seen Neko Case, the Antlers and others here. I can't speak to any of the concerns about the bathrooms or the drinks being tiny because I'm too interested in the bands. For the size of the city, the caliber of the bands coming in is pretty high as far as the indie world goes. The Avett Brothers were there and so was Blitzen Trapper. Of Montreal is coming up and so is Surfer Blood. Anyway, I'll really miss this place when I'm gone."
"Gonna keep it real. Went here because lotus was packed. In its own right, this place was busy too.\n\nReally good tofu pad thai. I'd come back for it. \n\nI gotta try more of the menu when I get back."
"I never would have even thought to stop in Kohli's if it wasn't for JB. He works near by and knows I love the scent of Nag Champa incense so he bought me some. While I was waiting for him to get out of work one day, I stopped in to take a peek at what they had to offer. My shopping basket filled up fast - jasmine rice, naan, samosa, mint chutney (try mixing that in some cous cous or quinoa and peas and pignolia), piri piri, ginger paste, cilantro chutney... the list goes on.\n\nThe goods you find here cost HALF of what you pay at Giant Eagle and other grocery chains. All I can say is that this place is amazing and I'm so happy it exists."
"I eat here a lot.  My office is in a weird spot and this is one of the few restaurants close enough to grab lunch.  I think it's pretty reasonable for Greek food.  Yes, it's fast food Greek, but still very good.\n\nI always get the Gyro Sandwich and fries.  I like my Gyro with Frank's red hot and nothing else.  Yum! Their fries are really good.  Nice and crispy.  A lot of people from my office love their greek salad with Gyro meat and Spanakopita.  For the price, you really can't go wrong with this place.  Get it to go.  The interior of this Gyro Time is creepy and uncomfortable.  Kind of like a lunchroom from the '70's."
"I walked into Landis with the intent to buy a PurFix and that's exactly what I did. They didn't have the model I wanted on the sales floor, but they had it in stock in the back warehouse. One of the guys put it together for me and made some adjustments after I rode it around out back. I'm fairly new to the fixie life and he gave me some great beginner tips! So helpful and an overall amazing experience. Will definitely be going back to them."
"I do love their rotisserie chicken the most.  I am not a huge fan of all of the sides.  I also do a lot of catering here for work lunches and they do a really great job at that.  Good option for fast, non fast food, just watch out for the sides..."
"I have not been to this location is such a long time, and I have to say I am impressed.  Great job on the remodel.\n\nStill a typical ENP however. \n\nWe had superb service from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. The waitress was very attentive to our needs and stopped by frequently to check on us. \n\nThe one bad thing I did notice was that space in here seems to have gone down. It doesn't feel as roomy as it once did. It's still the same space just rearranged to make it look more inviting."
"The guys here took the time to explain what was going on with my alignment in terms that I could understand. They definitely know their stuff.\n\nThanks Joe & Clint,\nChris S."
"So had I left without dessert, I would have left 2 stars. For some reason I thought I needed banana pudding, so I ordered up some and my friend ordered the peach kuchen. OMG!!! Forget about the banana pudding, that freaking kuchen was the best dessert I have ever had! I would probably stab someone in the face for some more.. srsly, it's that good! The banana pudding was way too sweet for me, thankfully my friend was willing to share her kuchen! I think I will go back just for dessert! Everything else was just so-so for us. We both had the Monday meatloaf, but nothing to write home about. Now that kuchen... that's something!!"
I loved the store. Its a nice airy store with all the baby \nneeds anyone could want plus some. \nThe registry was relatively easy to access and was great\nbecause I had a print out with exactly the mommy to be\nneeded. \nThe only problem I can see with the store is that because it\nis so large they could use some signage to help wrangle \npatients a little better. I felt like I was walking up and down \naisles like a lost child. lol\nAlthough i'm sure this tactic is great for business as i'm sure they\nhave some great impulse buys from wandering.
"""Tried Bob's for the first time this morning. I ordered the \""""hungry man hero\"""" and it was very good, and cheap. My girlfriend had the veggie omelette and she liked that as well. Bread was freshly baked. Our main gripe is that everything is served on disposable styrofoam, even for people dining in. Seems like they could cut down on all the waste by using reusable plates/glasses/utensils, or at least paper plates/cups, which would be more environmentally friendly than all of that styrofoam."""
"""I have been Dr. L's patient for about 2 years.  Dr. L. and his staff (hygienist, receptionists) are wonderful!!  Super friendly, prompt, and--most important--ethical.  One of my favorite things about this place is the zero pressure to steer patients into unnecessary procedures (whiteners, repeated x-rays, etc.) to pad the profits as so many newer dentists sadly do these days.  This practice has been around for decades and has a great community reputation and strong patient loyalty.  For good reason.  Dr. L even fixed a small chip on my tooth 2 times and didn't charge me a cent.  Where else can you get this kind of exceptional service?!!\n\nI recently moved out of state and, frankly, I have had a heck of a time finding a decent, ethical dentist in my new state.  I am seriously considering flying back to LV for a quick visit just to get my \""""maintenance\"""" here."""
"Yummy, yummy cheap red or white brats... Takes a while to cook on the grill as they didn't have any already grilling when I went. They didn't charge me for soda either. My companion says the beer is pretty tasty too...\n\nGreat, friendly service by the bar staff."
"""I dare you to resist the smell of sweet delectable donuts as you walk by this place. I double dog dare you. It is impossible.  Regardless of whether it is 2am or not, they are good all the time.  The fritters are outstanding also. You can get one and have breakfast for a good three or four days.  And this is the best cure for when the world has you down. I swear to god that the lady who usually works there in the mornings is the most cheerful person on the planet, and she was always throwing in bonus donuts. \""""You look like you could use another one of these,\"""" she'd say with a wink. Mental health professionals take note."""
"Amazing lunch for a decent price! I don't know why everybody is bitching so hardcore about this place. I almost didn't try this place because of all the one star reviews but my grandma loves the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e here so we went.\n\nI had the lunch combo: half the gourmet grilled cheese (awesome), tomato basil soup (amazing), and sweet potato french fries (nothing to rave about but nothing bad with them).\n\nFor dessert we had the vanilla creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e topped with fresh blueberries and strawberries. AMAZING! \n\nWe both had lunch, a dessert, and each an herbal tea (great selection of herbal teas!) and the total was only $34.50.\n\nThey also have a nice outdoor area to sit."
There is always an hour + wait but its delicious. Don't order the tuna taco unless you're a big fan of wasabi (cream sauce served over top). I recommend putting your name on the list and going across the street for a beer at Growlers.
"Carne asada used to be soft but now a little tough. But still tasty in the taco. And at $4.75 for the plate w rice n beans n small fountain drink, it's still a bargain n good snack."
"I really like this Home Depot. I was recently moving so I came to get a dolly. I planned on running in and running out but ended up staying about an hour. There were a lot of employees available willing to help. I didn't even know they sold boxes here for a reasonable price. In the future I know to come here instead of surfing Craigslist for boxes. Since I'm not that handy I am currently writing out a Honey Do List. Only downfall is that the parking lot is awkward and was pretty full but there weren't a lot of patrons inside. Also, all the registers were self check out which isn't the easiest when purchasing a dolly and large boxes."
"I agree with Jen T. that the decor could use some work. It does feel pretty generic. The food and service have always been great. Our servers have always seemed happy with their jobs. The strawberry pancakes along with the chocolate chip pancakes are the best that I have ever had. The orange juice is also outstanding as they squeeze their own. The Dutch Baby is also excellent. We always make sure to take visitors to the pancake house. When I travel back to the Midwest, people that have visited us will often talk about the pancake house."
"This is the best pizza in Oakland, and my favorite pizza in the entire city for that matter.  Milano's sells really delicious New York-style pizza, by the slice or by the whole pie.  The sauce and the cheese are both really good, and the crust is usually pretty tasty too.  My favorite pizza here is probably the primavera, but all the different pizzas are good.\n\nI am originally from upstate New York, in a city with a pretty large Italian population.  This pizza is what I eat when I miss my local pizza place from home.\n\nI'm only giving Milano's four stars because of its frequent crowdedness, which makes it difficult to go there and come back in the hour allotted to me for lunch, and because they only have Pepsi and not Coke.  Pepsi is an inferior beverage.  (Actually, I decided to relent and give it five stars anyway.)"
"Far from my normal cuisine we went for lunch. Service was ok, Not amazing. Food was good. Flavors where interesting and overall it was a good meal. It won't be a regular stop on my places to eat but once in a while it will make for a nice change of pace."
"If you can get there, go there-- cheaper than most places."
By far the best customer service and value for automotive needs. Was able to return purchase over a month old no questions asked and had the pays I never about $30 less than auto zone.
Haven't been here for awhile   The corned beef hash and home cut potatoes are still great. The service is always friendly.
"Sometimes this place can be a hit or miss. But when it's a hit...the turkey wings are really good. If I recall correctly, the pricing is about $10 bucks for a meat and two sides with a croissant or cornbread. The tea/lemonade combo are usually on point (but admittedly have had a hit or miss experience w/that as well). Overall, if it's a good day for the cooks AND servers, you'll enjoy the lunch outing."
"The dal. The dal. The dal. \n\nI lived in Kathmandu, Nepal for months. I have yet to find good dal in the states. Today I found it. Not only did I find amazing dal but the people here are so friendly. Great atmosphere. Great customer service. Fantastic food that brings me back to Nepal. Get your eat on!"
"I am a lover of diner food (real diner food...unless I'm in a pinch, you can keep your Waffle House). And Landmark is the real deal.\n\n1. I've been for breakfast, dinner, and late night and the food is killer all the way around. It's not 4 diamond or anything, but that's not what this place is. As far as diner fare goes, these guys set the standard. The French toast is excellent, and their Greek selections are pretty great, too.  And the dessert case. My word, the dessert case. I ordered an eclair on a late-night dessert run and the thing came to me on a full-size dinner plate.\n\n2. They are open until 4am. In Charlotte. No further explanation needed.\n\n3. This place is great for people watching. Awkward teenage dates? Yep. Bikers? Of course. Little old ladies fanning themselves after church? Why not. And they are all welcomed and happily coexist at the Landmark. \n\nAre you still reading? Haven't lost you yet? Well, why not? Stop it! Go to the Landmark."
"""This is the coffee shop I staggered into when it was 20 below and I just couldn't make it all the way down State Street to Fair Trade.  My favorite things about Michelangelo's are their toasty Chai lattes and the gorgeous artistic re-renderings of Michelangelo's drawings and paintings.  Honestly, whoever created the murals in this place is amazing.  Half the time I was in here to \""""study\"""" I ended up zoning out with my iPod, studying the wall art instead of econ (fine by me!)\n\nThe service is quick and friendly and the prices are good as well.  A great stop after a show at the Orpheum or post-Farmer's Market browsing around Capitol Square."""
"It is hard to find good Arabic food in this area, but Persian Garden Cafe is doing a great job.  When I entered, I was treated with excellent service.  They pointed me in the right direction as far as what to order, being that their menu looked very American.  It was hard to find the dishes that I love because most of them were given American names.  \n\nWhen I left with my take-out, I could not wait to dig in! I even had a few bites in the parking lot.  Their tabbouleh was top-notch and was served with lettuce leaves.  The lettuce leaves are not garnish- you scoop a bunch up with your leaf and eat it that way.  It is a cool, crunchy food that is wonderful on a hot day.  I also ordered a falafel pita, which was spot-on and delicious!"
"Rudino's is similar to a fast food restaurant, except that you order at the register and they bring the food to your table. Average price is $6-$8 for a grinder of calzone. The girl who took our order was incredibly friendly. Our food was brought within 8 minutes and I was impressed with the taste of my Turkey Reuben Grinder. The calzones were also quite tasty, and massive. Good place for lunch or casual dinner."
"The best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh, though People's and Bombay are good too.  I moved to Pgh from Ann Arbor, Michigan almost three years ago and it surprised me that there weren't more decent Indian restaurants.  But then I found India Garden and I took it back.\n\nIt is true that there service can be a little slow (can be, though not always). But they more than make up for it.  And with their 4pm-6pm half off special and their bar (at least in Oakland), it doesn't get any better.  \n\nI highly recommend their Navarratan Korma and their Tandoori Chicken.  Amazing."
"The food here is amazing. I have now sampled several items from their menu, and nothing has disappointed at all. I love the fact that they have PBR on their beer menu for $2. It makes paying for the food a lot easier on a tighter budget. Anyhow, even though the food, the room, the atmosphere are all 5-star, service still really needs to step up its game. For the quality offered, and the justified price point, the quality of service still needs improvement. Now, not by any means is the service atrocious, it's actually pretty decent. I just expect a bit more when I'm paying this much. Whether it's spaciness or inattentiveness, it just takes away from what can and should be 5-stars all around. Nevertheless, I will be back soon!"
Love this store! I don't have kids so getting the right gift for kiddos is always a challenge. The staff here are really helpful and full of suggestions in whatever price range you want. I know that whatever I buy is going to be high quality and I'm supporting a family-owned business. And who can resist the wall of wacky stocking stuffers?
"""Loved the place! \n\nI had the crab sandwich...which was HEAVEN ON EARTH.....but, on the other hand...at 12 bucks a pop...it better be....definitely pricey for a sandwich ...although they'd like 2 call it a \""""gourmet sandwich\"""" ....but u know what...they'd be right!\n\nI like their decor too....pretty cool...friendly servers...all in all, if u dont mind spending over 10 bucks for a sandwich, i can't see y u won't have a good time!\n\nOh, by the way, they have other stuff too like noodles, pastas and enchiladas...never tried those.."""
"Just do it! I like to buy shoes and work out clothes here. I tell my wife to take the kids and leave me here alone so I can get lost at the store. \n\nI enjoy shopping here because I can find great deals on shoes and shirts. This is a great store so I can stock up on shoes for the year. The music at the store gets me in the mood for some spending, after all I am in Vegas. \n\nFriendly staff with an upbeat attitude and big smiles. The other plus is the cold air, this store is a great escape from the outdoor heat."
"""This store is the reason that no one should be afraid to go to a porn store!  It's the least sleazy 'adult' store on the planet (next to Good Vibrations in San Francisco).  The staff is so warm, friendly and helpful.  You don't have to worry about asking them questions, so please ask if you need to!\n\nThey have almost everything you could ever want from an adult store.  They even have massage oils, candles, jewelry, etc.  My favorite part is their wall of vibrators.  Each vibrator has a description of the intensity and who it's appropriate for (for instance, \""""The Rabbit\"""" might not be the best for a beginner, and it says so).  It's such a great way for a novice to buy a vibrator, particularly if they're too shy to ask for advice.\n\nThey offer classes (like ones on how to tie up your partner), which I hear are great."""
I have food allergies and sensitivities so I was happy to find the Silly Yak Bakery.  These are the best tasting Gluten free breads I've ever eaten.  The cherry almond bread is too good to be good for you.  To me it tastes like a cross between angel food cake and pound cake with cherries folded in and topped with almond slices.  I use the amaranth bread for sandwiches.  There's nothing like cinnamon swirl toast in the morning to start my day.  There are no preservatives so freeze what you don't eat in a few days.  I wish they were open longer at night. My morning schedule and drive doesn't allow stopping before work  and by the time I can get there after working I feel rushed.  In my hurry I didn't realize there is a section of baked goods by the register that has gluten in it which I grabbed by mistake luckily my sister was with me and warned me.  I hope the staff would have warned me if my sister wasn't there.  I can't wait to try more.
"Great place for your monogramming needs or gifts for people that you just don't know that well!\n\nTons of variety with imported China-made cute items for your monogramming needs. \n\nQuick turn around, lots of options on fonts/colors/patterns. \n\nThey will monogram items that you bring in (not purchased from them) as well so no need to settle on their quality (which is not great on some items)!"
"I really like this bar. If I have to be honest, though, I'm not sure I would have stopped by the place if I were just randomly driving by cause it seems a bit sketchy from the outside, but since it's right next door to the in-laws, the wife and I grab a few cold ones before heading into the madness.\n\nThe beer is great, Meghan and Andy are da bizness, and the place has a pretty chill vibe. You can tell the staff gets along with each other by their kwerky and sarcastic sense of humor; just the way I like it. \n\nI give it two enthusiastic thumbs up."
"Wow!  I cashed in on an 80-minute Swedish massage gift card that my son gave me for Christmas.  I have a regular massage therapist that I've used for years who makes house calls, so I'm always kind of wary when I go to spas and strange people, as in unknown to me and my special requests.  Having an old back injury makes me kind of needy because I have sensitive areas that massage therapists can aggravate with too much pressure.  Sue, my therapist du jour, listened to my requests to go easy on certain areas and concentrate on others.  The result was 80 minutes of total relaxation and therapeutic touch.  From the time that I made the appointment with the extremely professional receptionist, the reminder phone call the day before the appointment, to the time I arrived and was ushered into the waiting room pronto, the service at this spa was first-class.  If I didn't love my own massage therapist so much, I would return here again!"
It was great!  I had the patty melt as we watched the Lakers on one of the many TVs.  The cole slaw tasted fake though.  But I will go back and try something else.\n\nService was A+
Lemon grilled shrimp tacos are unbelievable
"Vegas Plumbing is the best!!!!!! I contacted them because I had a cracked toilet. and they got on it right away. The plumber T.J was very nice, knowledgeable, professional and neat with his work. Upon arriving he called to let me know ahead of time when he will be arriving. I give this company 5 stars and I highly recommend this company for any plumbing services you need."
"I actually really like this place. Alot of their stuff is greasy but if you aren't worried about dieting than this place is a good alternative to every other fast food joint out there. Their fries are really good. I love the great gobbler special. Never tried the cluckeetos, but i'll give that a try next time. Their chicken is also good to me. It's too bad they don't give free refills on drinks otherwise i'd give 5 stars. Greasy =great when it comes to this place."
"I'm a huge fan of Hertz.  As a Gold Member, I can walk right up to my car and drive away......no waiting in line, no paperwork, no hassle.  This location is no different.  It's so easy to get in/out of the rental car center it's located in.\n\nOn this particular visit, I was upgraded from a compact car to a convertible Chrysler....I think it was a Sebring.  Too bad I only had it for 1 day and couldn't take full advantage of it.\n\nReturn Factor - 99%"
"I took my dog to another vet for 2 years when I first moved here. The experience was always fine. Nothing bad at all, but nothing to be too excited about. \nI didn't really ask around, but I started hearing more and more about A Breed Apart. A few of my coworkers who are surgeons had dogs with serious problems requiring surgery. The surgeries were performed at A Breed Apart, and they couldn't be happier. They also noted how reasonable the pricing was for their dog's care. They didn't feel like they were getting fleeced at all.\nSo when it was time for Jackson's annual checkup, we established care at A Breed Apart. They took fantastic care of his and answered all of my detailed laundry list of questions without hesitation. I was very happy with the switch, especially because I feel happy establishing care with vets that I would feel comfortable taking my dog in the case of an emergency."
"""Chaya is simply amazing.  It's a little hole in the wall place in Squirrel Hill that doesn't immediately grab your attention.  It's extremely small inside so make sure you go in small groups.  They are also very picky about your entire group being there before you are seated.\n\nThe service is quick and friendly and the waitresses will make suggestions for you if for some reason you can't decide between two rolls that look equally amazing :)  The rolls are all very consistently good and the fish is always extremely fresh.  The menu is very traditional - there are a few rolls that have a bunch of different ingredients but it's not a \""""fusion-sushi\"""" type of place that seems to be getting popular.  The sushi is very affordable, especially for the quality.  Now if only I still lived right around the corner..."""
"""I've been going to OHW for several years. Just have been ignoring my burger cravings. I am in agreement that the burgers are good and the fries are okay; but the fried food (onion wrings, zucchini, mushrooms) are great!!! My roommate has gotten the chicken sandwiches and we both fill up on the \""""fixings\"""" bar. I forgot how great the Ranch dressing is; also they have (or had) FANTA Red Creme Soda; I don't know why but I love that stuff."""
"I love Hooters. And it's not just because I have them...haha. No but seriously, I don't know why so many bad reviews. I've stayed here several times and its cheap, good food and close enough you can walk to the strip. The rooms have always been nice, the pool is big and I've won decently here several times (though we are talking slot machines, not tables). Plus, theres a little hooters gift shop. Personally, I like it here."
Great pho
"For all types of runners...slow...fast...seasoned...new, this store has got you covered. I fall into the fairly moderate - slow, not so new, but I am always running to run for your life (ha - pun!) to pick up race packets or check out their merchandise. \n\nThey will fit any type of runner for shoes based on preferences and gait. I personally haven't been fitted here, but prices look about run in comparison to other running shops in Charlotte. I also spied a smattering of energy gels, water belts, running clothing, etc. that will fit the needs of any level of athlete. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful and made sure to give me my runners group discount and double checked the sales price for me. I will say, though, I expected a little more merchandise in the store as there is a lot of open space in the store. Next time I'm in the need for something running related, Run For Your Life is definitely on my short list!"
"Good food.  Relaxing environment, moderately priced.  Just doesn't rock my socks off but hey you'll be happy."
"Delicious!  Best donuts in Vegas, definitely! Even though the place is completely run down, I could care less, the donuts are the best!"
"Coffee selection is amazing!  I just wish they had as good of a selection of parking spots. We had to resort to street parking.  Once inside, the environment is quirky and eclectic.  The space was cozy, although at times felt a tad too small.  My friends and I went to Smelly Cat to work on a project.  As soon as we arrived, we realized that this wasn't the kind of coffee house you could be productive at.  Due to the size restrictions, which hence, make the table sizes smaller, we had to enjoy our delicious coffee and relocate.  \n\nService was friendly and the atmosphere was super chill.  I'd go back for some schmooze time!"
"Never taking a cab from McCurran again.\n\nI hate the loooong cab line at McCurran.  If you do too, give these guys a call.  They will track your flight so they will be on time even if it lands early or late.  Driver was at the baggage claim with a sign with my last name on it in hand.  We hopped in the limo, popped the bubbly and arrived at our hotel on the Strip literally 20 minutes after we got off the plane."
"Dr. Devore is a life saver!  \n\nThe snore-guard he made for me has STOPPED my snoring!!!  It was so bad my other half often had to leave the room to get some sleep, but not anymore.  Very effective treatment that will last a lifetime.\n\nDr. Devore has done quite a few things to make my smile just perfect.  The care and personal attention he provided throughout the process was amazing, and I could not be happier with the results.  I've never had a more caring dental treatment anywhere.  \n\nAll who work at Town Center Dental are extremely professional and courteous.   What a great team they have going there."
"Luckily the view grabs your attention before the poorly placed Palm tree paintings. My boyfriend and I had soup for an appetizer, very good. I had the crab cakes for the main course, also tasty. The shared dishes left something to be desired. They were not bad by any means, but I am in no hurry to go back.  Wait staff was great. Very friendly, and let us take our time over a bottle of wine."
"Reviews on W&Js are all over the place.   We stayed at Sams for 5 nights and ate here twice.  Happy both times.   The food was maybe just above average .   We had marguaritas over the rocks (the only way) and were good.   Probably just depends on who is bartending.    1st time, they were perfect.  Not overly sweet with plenty of taquila.   2nd time, they were pretty ordinary but still good.   We sat inside the 1st time and then sat out on the patio which is nice.   The waterfall show is fine but just not while we're trying to enjoy our dinner.   If you have room for dessert, their flan is exceptional."
"One of the very few places I know that uses an authentic brick oven. Their crusts are thin, and that's jus the way I like them. They have a few Italian signature pizzas that you have to try, but you can also make your own. I've also learnt that there's no limit to the number of toppings you can order on your pizza. If you are a wine lover they also have a few selections that are good but not too pricey, especially if you want to order a bottle to go."
"One of the most authentic places to get Chinese food in the city. I've heard of servers being rude but had no such experience, they were quite curt though.\n\nWent with a friend. We ordered salt and pepper squid, spinach w/ garlic and crispy chicken with dry garlic oil.\n\nThe flavors were spot on, authentic Cantonese."
"I really do dig this place for its yummy food and its very close to my work, so it is pretty convenient.  I usually end up getting the General Tso's Chicken possibly because I'm white, but also possibly because it is just that good. I'm starting to think there is something in the sauce!  I've eaten a few other things that have all been good, and the lunch menu is pretty extensive, and inexpensive.  They keep the free tea coming, and the service has always been good.  The only thing that turns me off a little to this place is the atmosphere, it is a little bit run down in the entry way and the dining area.  I'll definitely be going back again, maybe for some more General Tsos, or maybe after reading these reviews for the salt and pepper squid."
"""At least in the summer, the \""""high end\"""" part of the mall is cooler than the other parts....no joke."""
Great service. The food was decent. But kinda expensive.
"This place is dramatically better inside since they fixed it up. The once dinky bar counter is now a full on bar with plenty of seating and selection. Various types or art adorns the wall, though it's a little dark to fully appreciate some of it. The lighting is appropriate for everything else though.\n\nThey didn't really change the stage area. There is still a giant stage with tons of space in front of it and plenty of dancing and sitting room. There is one new thing in the stage room. You can access a section of the bar now, which is awesome.\n\nThe is one let down. I'm not sure if they are fixing it up or it's just been closed but you can no longer get up on the balcony, which used to be one of my favorite places to relax. Hopefully they have it open again. But all and all, I love what they did with the place."
"Ali Baba has become my go-to for Middle Eastern fare in Pittsburgh.\n\nI've ordered a few different things but the absolute best thing on the menu is the lamb shank, which a waitress recommended as their specialty. She was so spot on. The meat is juicy and fall-off-the-bone tender, and the tomato-based broth is seasoned perfectly. Yum! The salad is great (no surprise there, I'll eat anything with that lemony Middle Eastern dressing) and the kabobs and hummus are pretty good, but beware of the baba ghanouj...sometimes it can be very bitter if they make a bad batch.\n\nThe service is slow as hell, always. Not a quick eat, but satisfying if you have the time. Delivery is available through Wheel Deliver."
"The first time I went here, I saw a couple in their 50s shopping for a strap-on, yet it wasn't awkward at all.  This is the best store for all your sexual needs.  They even have a display of all the condoms they carry, and a chart of different lubes and what they're good for.  Classy all the way."
"I just have to say that Dr. Berman is awesome! He came in on his day off to help me when my back seized up unexpectedly. In general, he is not pushy like many chiropractors can be (he'll happily see you as needed and then let you schedule freely after that). I've been going to chiropractors all my life and so I thought maybe I knew the gamut of adjustments, but he actually had a couple unusual ones that work wonders. \n\nI highly recommend!"
"Quick service and authentic fried chicken, but I wasn't completely blown away.  As the other reviews have said:\n\n1) It's cash only.  They do have an ATM.\n2) It's carry out only.  They were kind enough to recommend a park (Latta Park) down the street about 6 blocks east, and clearly we weren't the only ones that thought it was a good idea, because we saw at least 3 other people at that park with Price's boxes.  \n\nThe chicken was tasty, and the sides were good.  Better than Bojangles, but not the most incredible chicken I've ever had or anything."
"I adore Zenith. I've since explained this place to non-Pittsburghers as the hipster Cracker Barrel, though that description does not do Zenith enough justice. I chose the pumpkin pancake as my main entr\u00e9e at my last visit, but I have to admit, the star of the show is the buffet table. There wasn't a single item I tried from the buffet that was anything less than stellar, from creamy peanut butter Asian noodles to the fresh, crisp salad (because then I can pretend that I'm eating healthy, right?) to the myriad cakes they have lying in tantalizing wait for you at the buffet finish line... ahhhh. Lovely. My only regret is that I was too full to try more of those delectable bundt cakes. After our feast, we had a blast browsing through all of the antiques at the front of the store. Will be back soon!"
"So I'm obviously very much a latecomer to the Marigold scene, but I do have to comment on a couple of this cute restaurant's offerings.  The red cabbage slaw is maybe the best substitute for a side of chips to go with your sandwich like, really, forever.  It's a tangy vinegar slaw, rather than mayonaissey sweet.  A perfect sprinkling of caraway, and hmm... is that cumin?  Crisp, crunchy, savory & sour.\n\nThe open-faced tuna melt was also brilliant.  Bread-&-butter pickles instead of relish -- so simple, yet so good.  But God, I love that slaw!"
"I love love love this place....one of my favorite places in town....pretty much a hole in the wall next to it's trendier cousin, Chautara.....but the food is just as good, if not better...and definitely cheaper!....and if you are sitting outside on a pleasant saturday afternoon, who cares how dingy they are inside.\n\nMy only complaint is that although it's very reasonable for dinner, they have the same prices for lunch, so it makes it slightly on the expensive side, given that you can find cheaper lunch options that are just as good...i mean you are on State street!\n\nNonetheless, lunch or dinner, I'd definitely go here over and over again!"
A good choice for a special occasion. The food is always good here but I just can't quite give it 5 stars because I expect more when I am paying more. The inside is quite nice decor wise.
"Great food. Nice environment. The service is too slow, so try here when you have plenty of time."
Simply the best
"I've stayed at this La Quinta several times now and it's a pretty decent place.   It's way off the strip, so if you are a tourist that wants to hit up the nightlife, this probably isn't the place for you.   If you have other business in Las Vegas, this is a great alternative to the expensive hotels on the strip.   \nThe staff is quite helpful and friendly.   The rooms are clean.   In the morning they have a breakfast buffet.   But this last time, we got up around 9 and the buffet was closed.   Also the WIFI is free.   \nIf you are looking for an inexpensive place to stay while visiting Las Vegas, and you don't mind being away from the tourist attractions, this is a good place to stay.   Will I be back?   Sure I will, I enjoying visiting."
"I enjoy the dog grooming room, my pup is scared of the big box groomer we previously went to. Here I can do it myself with all the supplies & assistance if requested. Great selection of toys, treats, and food for a variety of pets. I especially like the amount of affordable all natural products. Pets are welcome! Great way to shop LOCAL!"
"Nice community, coffee served after mass in the morning which is nice and sometimes food.\n\nMass bread is a little thick."
"This is one of those small, ethnically specific stores where you can find just about anything that the big grocery stores don't have.  It's a very nice little store that has all the spices and various odds and ends you might need for that new recipe you're trying.\n\nI mention this establishment because it does have something that sets it apart from the rest.  If you have read some of my other reviews you've probably noticed that I am a fan of asian food, and this goes double for asian candy.  This store has a larger and more diverse candy and snack section than any other market I've been to.  From sweet to salty they have it all.  The only problem I have with this place is that they don't have mochi and I love that stuff.  Other than that, it's a great place to explore and try something new."
"I will say this for Super Mex: they're consistent. They're nothing spectacular, and the service is sometimes a bit lackluster, but for reasonably inexpensive Mexican food, 24 hours a day, they definitely do the trick! Their fajitas are actually quite good, and both the cheese enchiladas and chimichangas are good standby items."
"I normally don't comment on service because that always varies depending on who you get, but I must say that our waitress was amazing. She seemed to be the only one working the whole restaurant, but I didn't notice. My drink was never more than half empty and she was working her butt off! Extra star just for her.\n\nA little local sports bar with a pretty extensive menus- dinner entrees, salads, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, etc. I was only expecting pub dishes when we saw this place, but we were pleasantly surprised. My husband and I both ordered the Western burger. Overall solid burger- the patty itself was a little under seasoned, but the BBQ sauce had a good flavor and I enjoyed every bite.  \nHad the Frings on the side- fries and onion rings and they were delicious. Everything was crispy and well seasoned. \n\nGreat little joint to stop in to watch the game and have a well cooked meal. Great selection for a bar."
"I've been seeing Linda the PA for many years now.  She is super attentive, gives good advice and never rushes me through an exam.  I have recommended 3 friends to this doctor's office and they all have become lasting patients.  I'm personally a cash pay patient also and the prices aren't totally unreasonable.  I've also never had a billing issue and am always given an appointment in a reasonable amount of time...OH! And if they need to call you back for any reason, they always do...you never have to track a nurse or a doctor down. Hard to find good anything in Vegas, but I think this doctor's office is way above Vegas standards."
Fair prices. Decent service. Ever since I tried sonic back in 1997 I have loved there food. They keep coming out with new items to keep things fresh. My only complaint is their ice cream machine breaks down a lot.
Hamburgers.\n\nReally good ones.\n\nGet the Hamburger with the blue cheese on it.\n\nSoggy fries.
"This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant.  I am not rating it on its pnash - it has none.  This is a restaurant and food as you would find it in China.  I love the food and have had many of the dishes.  This stuff is great.  Be warned, there are people that have difficulty getting over some of the textures, decor and presentation, but I love this stuff.  Amazing and exotic."
"I'll be short and sweet here, I love this place!! Every time I need a last minute card or gift for someone, this place delivers!  I've bought gifts for all kinds of people here too, they have great things for kids, drunks, odd-balls, and lunatics and I suppose normal people too, but I don't associate with any of those types..."
"A place that specializes in fine seafood is very rare in Madison. When I come to think about it, from someone that was born and grew up in the area, I can only think of Red Lobster and weekly Friday fish fries as places I've had seafood from in Madison! Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are a lot of other seafood places in Madison but the Blue Marlin is probably amongst the best. I recently dined here over the UW graduation weekend. Apparently that weekend was booked in advance for months.  I had a special that contained: broiled halibut, a tenderloin, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. All of it was fantastic."
"Will definitely recommend to everyone.\n\nI was looking foe tire replacements and the people there talked to me very nicely. Later I found another source where I can get cheaper tires so decided only going there for installation. They behaved as politely as before. Price is very competitive and job was done quickly. Just picked up my car, will see how their job turned out to be. Believe that kind men also have remarkable craftsmanship."
"""Another place on my \""""why I moved to Charlotte\"""" list, and my first retroactive 5 star review.\n\nBrunch here on Saturdays back in aught-three was amazing. French pressed black grounds of shockingly dark coffee for cheap - before CLT knew anything other than Dilworth and Starbucks. Vegan sausage, homemade. Farro for brekkie, before it was Batalified. It was a long, long drive but 100% worth it, and a lot of the time, you had to wait, so I guess we weren't the only ones that didn't care.\n\nAlas, by time my toukas made it to crown town, they'd put the kybosh on nosh and focus now on martial arts classes, etc. Used to be, post face-stuffing, you'd catch the end of the Kiddie class through the huge windows, and feel kinda guilty that the only reason you ever came was for food. Not that guilty, tho. \n\nI miss you, PDBr."""
"Wouldn't go anywhere else. Close and easy to stop into, great for gifts, employees BIG plus for being so knowledgeable / helpful"
"""\""""You raise me up, so I can stand on mount washington\""""\n\nThis was a lot of fun.  I mean its not a heart pounding ride but if you appreciate some ridiculous views of Pittsburgh and experiencing a piece of history then come on down.  Although you can freak yourself out thinking about what if the cord snapped and you went plummeting down the incline toward the water. \nIts a slow ride to the top so those with fears of heights might wanna sit down...or drive up.\n\nRecommend riding this during the day to the top and then heading back down at night after a couple cocktails and some dinner when the city is lit up. (we ate at Monterey Bay Fish Grotto...review to follow)\n\nIf you are so inclined on the incline there is a little tour of the inner workings of the machinery and tons of pictures etc in the pavilion at the top.  I am a dork, so I found it fascinating.\n\nAs other reviews have stated bring exact change as I did not and I ended up with pocket full of quarters and dollar coins.  Not a good look."""
"Really Groovy Place! Whenever I have out of town guests, i always take them here and they always LOVE IT!!! This is a fun place and the staff are always nice. but... Please do something about the crazy birds trying to eat of my plate!!!"
"Burgers, breakfast, Philly's, Mexican food and Gyros.... oh my!! This place has the biggest menu of mixed flavors I've ever seen. The co-workers and I go here at least a couple times a month since its just down the road. I feel kind of bad reviewing this place because I've never actually tried their burgers and I'm guessing that is their specialty so I'll have to update this once I've tried them. We work super early so I always get breakfast. I was really disappointed in the biscuits and gravy but then I tried the Original Breakfast Burrito and that is what made me fall in love with this place. The thing is HUGE and only cost $4 bucks..what! No need to decide what kind of meat you want this BEAST comes with all three..sausage, ham and bacon. All wrapped up with eggs, hash browns and  cheese. This place looks like a dive but most of the best places do. Can't wait to try the burgers!"
"Neither the name, location in front of the Fantastic Swap Meet nor physical appearance would suggest fine Chinese dining, but fine dining is what we enjoyed.  Unlike many Asian restaurants, service was both cheerful and attentive.  We shared orders of sauted shrimp coated with mayonnaise with honey walnuts, Singapore rice noodles and pea leaves with garlic.  The latter was not on the menu and relatively expensive at $11, but delicious."
"""What can I say, I love an Iris Pub.  Seamus does a good job of providing good drinks at a decent price. Seating is a little limited for really large groups - we had to take over more than one table, but the staff didn't bat an eye when 20 or so people stumbled in.\n\nLive music was good, just made it a little loud.  I love to eat there, but instead tried on a liquid diet.  I had some of the various beers they offer, but my friends tried the \""""Prairie Fire\"""" which was strong enough to make my eyes water from 10 paces.  I actually think they have to have a fire extinguisher handy in case you spontaneously combust while drinking it.\n\nAll in all Seamus is always a solid choice when downtown, for lunch, dinner or an evening out."""
"What's not to like about the Squirrel Cage?  It's not a theme bar, you'll not find any cheesy decor or anything fancy that matter.  It's simply a great neighborhood place.  As other posters say, it's a place to have good, cheap, greasy food and a beer (okay, so I'm primarily a non-drinker).  It's a great place to people watch too because here you see people as they really are.  They come here and they act like themselves and aren't putting on an act like at some lame club."
"Good luck finding a parking space. This is an old building with the character of a 50's type luncheonette. Huge Line, and we came right behind a fire engine with about 8 firemen. (so we knew that cheap, good food was on the way)\n\nFried pickles and peanut butter and banana sandwiches-fried, of course-this is an Elvis-type place."
"Bring on the calories! This is the place to go if you are feeling really hungry, or really under-weight. Where else can you get perfectly fried chicken with waffles? Most of the choices on the menu are reasonably priced, and the new design of the place is open and bright. I also thought it was very clean inside, which one would not expect from a restaurant that prides itself on serving neon colored and super sweet cool-aide. \n\nWhile the waffles are nothing to write home about, the chicken is fried to perfection. It was tough finding a parking spot, and we had to eventually park across the street. Not knowing if you car is going to get towed kinda made me rush through my meal. The grits left something to be desired - they were dry and had little seasoning. If it wasn't for the huge hunk of butter (which seems to be the only ingredient/condiment that the kitchen used), I would have not eaten the grits at all. Thankfully, the hot sauce made them taste alright. \n\nWill I come back? Probably, but only after I recover from my heart attack from the last visit."
"Fast friendly service. They were able to refill our propane tank (which someone, who shall remain nameless, insisted was empty) in just a matter of moments and only for $5 and change. Sweet.\n\nHoney, please consult me before we take a trek around uptown trying to find a place to refill our tank. Thanks, babe. Love ya. kthxbai.  ;)"
"Terrific all the way around. Our sales person, Dan Brown, was absolutely great. My previous new car buying experience was in large metro areas where you dealt only with scum at every dealership. Madison dealerships of all brands are terrific. People should appreciate how lucky they are here.. \n\nDan was very knowledgeable and a great salesperson, he knew all the specifics about the competing models we were looking at and when it came down to price we already knew the invoice price and didn't have to haggle over a couple of hundred dollars. Dan also told us how UW employees get an extra discount from Mazda because the U has a business relationship with them."
"One of the few places left in America that does broasted chicken, let alone does it this well. I have to travel about 400 miles to hit up Frisch's (f/k/a Carrick Poultry) but it's worth it. Been loving this chicken for about 30 years and it's still as great as it's always been. Can't speak for any of their other food aside from chicken and broasted potatoes, but that's all you need."
"I feel like I shouldn't even divulge this information, but they had one of their killer sales a couple weekends ago.... everything 40-50% off!!! I finally got the bank of old-school lockers I always dreamed of to use as a bookcase for my front room. My boyfriend was pissed because it was so freaking heavy, but it looks badass!!! LOVE!!!!"
"I eat here a lot.  For Madison and the Midwest, this is very decent Vietnamese food.  I give it a 4 - not because it's bad or the place is dirty or the service is terrible (because none of that is true) - but because I am aware that there are better parts of the country where there is better (and cheaper) Vietnamese food.  (I also rarely give out 5's, and actually have yet to do so).\n\nHere are the reasons I like eating here:\n- it's decently priced (large bowl of pho is about $6.75)\n- the pho is delicious (great broth base)\n- the wait staff are friendly (and after coming here so much they tend to know me and what I usually like to get)\n- the restaurant is clean and well-maintained\n\nI highly recommend Saigon Noodles.  Good authentic ethnic food in Madison."
This place rocks. There are always 20% off coupons to be found so you never pay full price.  Their regular prices are cheaper than most if not all of the other cleaners in the area.  They are a family business and the service is friendly.  I have never had a problem with my clothes and they also preserved my wedding dress for only $110.
"One of my favorite things about the pretzel shop is it's homey feel. They've got lots of funny signage about not using your cell phone in the store. Love it!\n\nThe pretzels are VERY salty and typically served cold. So if you're not into that, you're not going to like it. You can't beat the price. I often times find myself craving a pizza pretzel, which I believe is only $1.75. They're so good. It's a small portion, which some people complain about, but what else could you expect with price? I think it's more than what you pay for, though. Definitely a good value. \n\nMy only complaint is the hours of operation, but with a small, family owned shop, I guess short hours can be expected."
"I have been a patient of Dr. Whitely at Healthy Outlook Family Medicine for about ten years. Dr. Whitely is so caring and always seems genuinely concerned about my health issues and how I'm doing. I never feel like she's in a rush or just trying to get to the next patient. She always takes the time to discuss any concerns that I have and to find out what's going on with me. I have spoken to friends and coworkers about their primary care physicians and when I compare my experiences with Dr. Whitely to their experiences with their physicians, I know that I am so lucky to have Dr. Whitely as my PCP. I always brag about what a great PCP I have. I would highly recommend Dr. Whitely and any of the staff at Healthy Outlook. I live in the east valley so the office isn't close to home, but I will never go anywhere else for my primary care needs. Dr. Whitely is worth the trip :)"
"Fantastic breakfast but can get so busy it is almost a challenge. Thank god for Super Marigold Woman...she has special powers and busts people for taking up seating before ordering. It is definitely necessary as it gets very busy. French toast on the weekend is deluxe. Espresso is good. The kitchen is a well oiled machine and interesting to watch from the bar. Not a place to pull out the Sunday paper or laptop and chill, Marigold is all about eating and the eating is good."
"Dr Jacquie is a fantastic vet! She practices acupuncture, and has been treating my dog since summer 2011 for hip issues. She is conservative in her approach, and does not recommend unnecessary procedures or medications. Dr. Jacquie also answers emails when you have questions or concerns. I highly recommend her to anyone that wants to use holistic medicine to treat their pets.\n\nThe staff is also great, and very friendly."
"What can you say about a place thats been open in the same spot, owned by the same family for 33yrs and isn't going anywhere. I have been a loyal customer for 32 of those years. The food is unchanged and excellent, the Red Salsa which I am addicted to and still cannot get the recipe, makes me drive 70 miles round trip to buy a quart and fresh chips, I have had everything on the menu and my personal favorite is the Chorizo egg potato and cheese with three cups of salsa inside. I have taken friends and family when they visit and all love it, Every Christmas I have to send a gallon of salsa and 5 lbs of Chorizo to cousins in Missouri. Love this place."
"My Experience:\nAs always, George Fisher came through. My big brother was in from Augusta, GA and his Tahoe shut down. A call to George and the roll back was here to pick it up - later revealing a warranty repair. Now he knows why our late Mother and I have relied on George for our auto service needs for so many years. Thanks George - great job!!! \nPS - Throw in at least an extra $50 for his outstanding service! \nYour faithful and forever customer!!"
"""I rolled up to the ticket window (I'll assume that's what they are referring to when they say \""""Thomas and Mack Center Ticket Information\"""") with my ginger monkeys in tow to buy tickets for the Sesame Street Live show from May 6-7th. They were running around crazy, which was fine considering there was a lot of space for them to roam without going into the street (huge plus for parents). \n\nSandra helped me out BIG time. I asked for the best seats that were available and she totally hooked me and the monkeys up. Thanks to her..we are going to be able to see Elmo's nose hair (we are sitting front row center). She also informed me that with the front row seats comes a voucher for the kids to get a picture with the cast of characters. I was almost in tears. Sandra totally made me and my monkeys year. \n\nNext time I have to get tickets for an UNLV event...I'm going to seek out Sandra. Thanks a lot girl!"""
The Staff was very knowledgeable and helpful with my questions. I am looking to transition to clipless pedals and the staff clearly explained it all to me and didn't even pressure me to buy. They even recommended for me to bring my bike in and they'll lift it up so I can practice with clipless pedals first prior to deciding to purchase and/or taking them out on any trails. Great service.
Chicken was actually cooked completely done ( so many places rush the meat :/)  and moist; however lacked umph. Good chicken-not as flavorful as Viva. The sides here are more variety than the usual french fries&mashed potatoes. We love black beans!The squash casserole and smoked cheese pasta salad were yummy.  The spinach in the pasta salad was an unexpected pleasant surprise.  Corn muffins had real bits of corn. The place is like McAlister's where you order and leave your name. Get your food and leave your plates. Nothing fancy and sometimes that is a good thing :) So I can only speak on service of cashier. She was efficient and cordial.  Prices are very affordable and under $11 per entree. Will add to our dining out rotation.
"""Pleasantly surprised. Read the name and that's exactly what you get. Good sized inside, reasonable drink prices and the bartender we dealt with was great. We play in a dart league there some nights so while somewhat forced to visit last night I would surely come back.\n\nI like the \""""old\"""" feel it has. It doesn't breach dated, no that's not what I mean by old. Its a nice neighborhood bar. Perfect place to come and just hang out on a weekday after work."""
I had dinner here at a recommendation from a local person I spoke to at a department store. This is my dinner and feed back:\n\n- Spring rolls were good but not great as they lacked enough spices for my taste.\n- Pork fried rice was good and I would definitely order it again.\n- Kung Pow chicken was very good with just the right amount of spicy flavor for me.\n- Mongolian beef was also very good although just a slight bit too salty but I think that comes from the soy sauce reduction when cooking.\n\nAll in all nice sized portions as it was just me and they did not cut back on portion size for one person so I had left overs for the next two days. \nIn closing I would eat here again if I have another rental care when in Vegas.
Found Wally's on Yelp and went to get a low beam headlight replaced. They only charged me for the bulb and had me in and out in 10 minutes. Great customer service provided by Daniel. I will be back for maintenance on my Honda.
The staff here is extremely helpful and knowledgable! I went in looking for Japanese Beetle Traps and got a full lesson on how to deal with my pest problem and prevent it next year. I was very impressed.
Amazing food though service was a little bit slow.
"winchell's is a dying breed. with krispy kreme & dunkin donuts poppin up all over las vegas there aren't many left but the make the largest, freshest and cheapest donuts around. great coffee too! they usually give kids a free donut or some donut holes."
Clean store & friendly service
"I have taken my vehicles to Desrt buick GMC, now known as Autonation for many years, to get serviced.\nWhen I go, I only deal with Mike Zibell. He is the best! Knows my cars, knows my wants and needs and always does the job to keep me, and my family not only satisfied, but safe.\nI wouldn't trust anyone else, nor would I trust any other shop."
"Almost wish I didn't work Uptown because this is a great lunch spot. They have a surprisingly large menu including everything from rotisserie chicken plates to taco salads.\n\nOrder at the register and wait for your name. They have a large dining area and some porch seating. Perfect for groups or individuals. Super quick, inexpensive, and delicious.\n\nAs for the food, I enjoyed my meal but was underwhelmed with my choice. The chicken and rice con queso was good, but the rice was bland in my opinion. Disclaimer: not a big white rice lover. But the chicken and queso and cornbread were on point. Next time I'll go the rotisserie chicken plate route.\n\nEager to try this place again, just wish it was closer to me."
"I live a lot closer to the Costco in Matthews, but been here a couple times (either for gas) or picking things up after an airport run.  Great place to shop (be mindful of the bulk though) and the monthly coupon specials are nice as well.\n\nMy one gripe with this location is the setup they have at their gas pumps.  Maybe this location was put in as an after-thought, but it's hard to navigate and make sure you are going the right way if you are looking for a pump lane.  Luckily it hasn't been too crowded when I've gone for gas.... but the Matthews location has a nice queue area where the cars are out of the way of the main incoming traffic to the stores."
"It is a nice place to go once a year. The novelty of cooking your own food is quickly worn out. nice people, though."
"""Oh waffle house. How great you are at 2, 3, 4 AM. Some people love you. And some people hate you. I however, am a lover. I recently came to this Waffle House on a random whim. One night of gaming with friends and then \""""hey, lets go to Waffle House!\"""" Is exactly how that went down. I believe it was 3 AM, and how delicious that all star breakfast was. \n\nMind you, I wasn't drunk at even the slightest. So that definitely makes me a credible review. This Waffle House is on of the close ones near my parent's house so I come here often. That and it it's a mid point between my friend's house. It's clean, and it's not like most other waffle houses.\n\nSo I get this, every time I come here. The all star breakfast: Over easy, hash browns, sausages, and waffles. Oh yes, delicious whenever at any time. If i'm up late again and decide to have food, this is where I'll be coming to for a quick meal."""
This is the only grocery store I buy my meats at. The price is fair and the product is top of the brand. I love their produce. Especially the apples. I love the anywhere from 2X to 4X the Smith gas points when you buy gift cards. And I really look forward to my coupons in the mail.\nCON: Loose baking Potatoes. the price is good the produce itself is under par. I am disappointed in only that them. Its a shame everything else is so fresh and they are so not worth the money.
Craig Road Animal Hospital is the only vet I trust. The professional doctors and trained friendly staff are always prepared and ready for any emergencies. They saved my Piggys life and immediately jumped into action to start treating him. I bring both my pitbulls they love Dr.Daniels. She always makes me feel better too. When we would visit we would get the red carpet entry thru the back so we don't have to disturb other visitors. My dogs are aggressive to other animals and I could not find muzzles to fit them. Craig Road ordered me some so we could safely visit thru the front entrance. They offer all kinds of specials work with u financially and really do care! Thank you Craig Road Animal Hospital!
"BEST fried pickles in my life! I only travel to Charlotte occasionally on business, but when I'm in town the first place I hit up is the Penguin- just for the fried pickles.\n\nThe sweet potato fries are also the best I've had- they have this brown sugar based dipping sauce that is out of this world. It actually was no longer on the menu last time I made a visit, but our hero of a waitor went in the back and whipped it up himself.\n\nThe burgers are good and the BBQ is also pretty straight. But if you make the trip out to Penguin, you will be kicking yourself for the rest of your years if you don't order the fried pickles."
"Looking for a specific magazine, or a specific book, be it fiction, auto-biography or reference, they either got it or can get it. \n\nIt's a nice way to spend a rather, cool and rainy friday night, sitting with my hubby, looking through the latest crochet today magazine, sipping on strawberry lemony iced tea, and listening to some good jazz over head.  My idea of a fun night out."
"I went in to buy my first suit, was greeted well and fitted right away. I had Zeke as the sales associate and he was fun, helpful and honest; just what you want in a sales person. I went in on a Saturday, needed my suit by Monday.  They had it tailored by Sunday.  The prices were higher than I expected, much more than what you can get online.  If I knew what I was doing I would shop online.  I received a 40% because the final price was too high for me, which I greatly appreciate.  It's a nice store, employees are dressed well.  I will be a repeat customer."
I have been going to them for over 5 years now. I had a lot of cavities and they corrected all my problems and kept my teeth in nice shape ever since. They are mostly professional and friendly. Their prices are kind of higher than other dentists so I recommend not going there without dental insurance or a discount card.
"I got around to driving here for lunch one day and wow I could smell the place before I could see it. I don't have much fried chicken experience but their chicken is moist, tender, and crisp on the outside. Knowing it's probably a heart attack in a box makes it even more delicious! Sweet tea is quite a foreign concept to me coming from out west, but after one sip I had to buy another cup. I wish there was some form of seating available though, maybe a couple chairs outside or something at least?"
"""I've been in town for 32 years now and first was recommended to Ted Wiens in the early 1980's when they were downtown. At that time, they offered to 'knerl' the front spindles on my 1950 Chevy Pick-up to save me replacing them. It is that type of \""""save the customer money\"""" that is still alive and well at this location at Decatur and Rancho. When you go, ask for Randy. He is the type of honest, hardworking mechanic that you just don't find everywhere. I've followed Randy thru a couple shops in our area in the last 10 years and now he is at Ted Wiens, Decatur and Rancho. I hope he stays here ! !  But if he doesn't...I'll track him down again. He is that good ! !"""
Every kind of hard liquor you can think of is here and in different sizes. Staff super nice.
The pizza is outstanding but that's only half the reason to go.  The staff and the vibe is what puts this place over the top!\nThere's no reason to try to get pizza anywhere else.
"""They have a very \""""hippy\"""" vibe here. They have some pretty great drinks, but I must say, the real reason I come here is because of the pinball machines in the back. I may be terrible but I sure can waste a lot of time trying to win a game of pinball, or at least beat the boyfriend! =)"""
Love Dr. Weisner and his staff. I have a little girl with CP. Would not trust ANYONE else with my baby! He treats my whole family! My 2 boys get adjusted from playing competitive soccer when needed. And the staff always tries to fit us in whenever its needed! We moved far from the office buy would never dream of going elsewhere!
"Oh my god.  How does this place not have five stars?  I have never seen so many women so happy in my entire life.  And I'm one of them.  I lost all my cash and my voice while screaming in excitement all night, and I didn't even realize I was doing it.  So worth it."
"Joe's a good guy. I've been going over there for almost ten years, since he used to be in the Union Trust building. Never any problem getting in, in and out in a half hour. always a quality haircut.\n\nHe just recently raised his price to $30, and I give a $5 tip, but that's not a bad price for downtown."
"I enjoyed working with the Monroe Road Animal Hospital folks. I've started seeing another veterinarian because the prices at Monroe Road are a little high, but they are still competitive in Charlotte.\n\nThe staff is friendly and loving towards our animals, and they are willing to listen to the needs of pet owners. When my cat was having some urinary tract issues, they trained me to empty his bladder manually...and when I couldn't quite figure out how to do it myself, they were willing to let me bring him in. They took him in and hooked him up with a pee-massage...and they didn't charge me.\n\nYou don't get much better service than that!\n\nI also appreciated it that they called to check on kitty after I brought him home from some of his health crises. They genuinely cared, and I always felt like it was about my cat's health instead of the money."
"Not all dentists are created equal.  Dr. Linker has to be the most gentle dentist I've ever experienced. Had a filling re-done recently and hardly felt the anesthetic even go in!  The office is very clean, modern and professional.  The staff is great too. They're all very friendly and really make you feel comfortable."
"I normally get the general tso's chicken and fried rice.  They normally cook it within 10 minutes. I think it tastes pretty good and reasonably priced. They may only have 1 table with 4 chairs, but I only consider it a take out restaurant. It is not gourmet, but it is good for what it is."
"Holy mackerel! Or should I say Holy Vanilla Croissant! This place is out-of-this-world delicious. I cannot remember ever going to a bakery this good in the US, and possibly even when I was actually in France. I'd highly recommend the recommend the raspberry cake, the vanilla croissant mentioned earlier, and - perhaps above all else - the Kouign Amann. I remember having a pastry similiar to the last one often on the way to class from a french bakery while I lived in London and I never thought I'd find anything like that here again. So good! A part of me is really happy that this place is a bit of a drive from where I live. Otherwise, it could be dangerous."
"In addition to all the rave reviews about Alta Vista staff saving pets from horrible circumstances, i would like to add that they have very reasonable rates for routine care.  I have also boarded dogs there for short trips out of town.  The rates were good, and the dogs were returned happy."
"I have confirmed the rumors that Big Wong will be closing before the end of the year. The owners have been locked in to a lease they assumed for the last 15 years and with the down-turning economy aren't able to continue.\n\nIf you want a very reliable meal in a super friendly environment, rush on over before they close their doors forever.  : ("
"We visited Las Vegas for the first time and were on our way out of town wanting to get something to eat and not pay an arm and a leg.  A quick search on Yelp Mobile (I wonder how I ever lived without this app) and we were led to Que Huong Vietnamese Restaurant.  After having had Food Court Chinese the night before on Las Vegas strip, I was craving some real food. \n\nMy wife and I both had the pork chop with broken rice. Very good and on par with the Vietnamese restaurants in Little Saigon Garden Grove, CA.  Overall a really good meal with  friendly staff at a reasonable price. ~ $17 for both meals with a cafe sua da (Vietnamese Iced Coffee)"
"I am not a mexican food expert but this place was pretty darn good!  The outside looks kinda sketch and it's attached to a Days Inn which makes is seem somewhat suspect. But once you walk in it's fine.  \n\nWe walked in and were immediately seated and served delicious chips and salsa (only the first 2 bowls of chips are free as I saw on the menu) not like you need more than that but just sayin...\n\nI had a combo plate of a taco and an a cheese enchilada with rice and beans, it was enormous and only about $7, I also had a giant peach margarita that was delicious.  That cost more than my meal ($8 I think?) but I had a rough day and it was worth every penny.  \n\nConsensus - cheap, decent mexican food a short drive from my apartment.  Sold."
cute! how could you NOT like this place?
Small door leads to a dark and not so smokey bar. Average age this Sunday night is about 50. Feels like it's been around forever. Drinks are strong. Very relaxed.
Always happy to support this local business. I refuse to pay $160 for a new battery. I can get a new one here for $65 with an 18 month warrenty. I could also buy a used one for $35 with a 6 month warranty. They always take care of myself and my family.
Top quality service that is honest and dependable. Wouldn't go anywhere else with my Nissan.
"Tasty food and tasty cocktails. Cocktailwise, of particular note, is the motor oil and the vegetable oil, although the indotini and nutty ginger were also good. Food was quite good although I expected the rendang to be a bit spicier (and in fact the papaya dish was a bit spicier than expected).\n\nMain problem was the 80 minute wait for our entrees. Staff stated that they had quite a bit of delivery and takeout orders that jammed up the kitchen. Would have thought the diners in the restaurant would take priority, but no denying the food was quite good when it arrived."
Not bad! This is not Chicago good but fresh and full of flavor ..... that should get your attention. I or my wife stop and get a something every time we are in Madison. The deli is a treat offering a variety of sides including meet balls ..... bring some
"I like Big Dog's a lot. If I had my choice, I'd go to the Draft House, but if I'm in the area, Big Dog's on Sahara is a worthy replacement.\nSame great local craft beer, including the Red Hydrant(?) I like so much!"
Sorry to see the bad reviews. We went on December 23 and it was a great place to go for Christmas Celebration.  The seafood tower for appetizer for table was excellent. My son-in-law had lobster bisque and said it was incredible. There of us had scallops because we were having steaks at home on Christmas Eve. They were excellent. One had Delmonico and it was fantastic. Great Service we go once or twice a year.   Doesn't disappoint.
I liked this theater because it is not too huge or too small.  It's easy to navigate and is not overwhelming.  I didn't feel like a criminal going through security. It was fast and they were friendly.
"price/performance ratio here is very good. excellent, tasty food at very reasonable prices. there's no good reason to eat on the strip."
"""I've complimented the chef before.  He is a food guru.\n\nThere is nothing that is NOT amazing here.  But do yourself a favor and get some dolmasi.  Feeling sluggish after you're stuffed with food?  Have a turkish coffee, which one of their waitresses once referred to as \""""Waitress Crack.\""""  It'll perk you right up and make you feel like $1,000,000.\n\nIt's a beautiful, dimly lit restaurant--very romantic.  The service has never been bad, always very efficient and courteous.  \n\nEvery time I'm done with a meal here, I feel so happy.  It's like I have a renewed sense of goodwill toward mankind.  Thank you, Husnu's, for turning me into less of an ass each time I eat at your establishment."""
"Lowered The Beast one inch and needed alignment,  this guys took care of my car with great care as much as they did Counts Kustoms 1928 limo that was on the bay next to mine. \n\nMy alignment did need lots of TLC and they took care of it properly and for a nice low price.  I recommend it to anyone with ANY motor vehicle."
"I could never dine at a sushi place in Vegas without consulting Yelp first. And of course, it came in handy.\n\nThe restaurant is fairly small and more rundown, so I kind of saw it as one of those hole-in-the-walls that is a gem to discover.\n\nThe staff is super nice, no doubt. The menu is easy to understand, although there aren't any pictures. All of our food was delicious (we ordered 3 sushi rolls and a box combo). My first two rolls (Playboll and Vanessa) were very tasty. But I didn't care for my last roll (Sex On The Beach).\n\nI also thought it was cute how they give you a complimentary appetizer for the beginning of your meal and small slices of oranges at the end. I'm not sure when their happy hour is but would love to return again in the future to grab some yummy sushi for cheap."
"""What is there not to love about this place??? Super friendly people working here and really know there stuff. I was trying to explain something I was looking for and even though I did not know the \""""correct\"""" term for it she was able to figure it out with my horrible description and body movements(she would be a good Pictionary partner).\n\nPrices are really fair and they have everrrryythhingg you could think of.  My number one spot to check out for when I'm getting costumed out."""
This place reminds me of the great bar I'd go to in Ann Arbor after evening classes in grad school (but without awkward run-ins with underage undergrads who shouldn't have been there in the first place). The ploughman's platter and curry fries were great. It's also very kid-friendly (at least in the afternoon when we visited) and has an interesting kids' menu. It's a fun place to watch the Penguins.
"""I never thought to go in here because of the Ross in the same shopping center, but I decided to yesterday for the heck of it and it was totally worth it.\n\nIt has always seemed to me that the items at Marshalls were pricier than Ross and they are, but for good reason. The store has a better selection of clothing and all the racks were so packed. Their \""""clearance\"""" section didn't seem like clearance at all (due to the price), but nice clothing nonetheless. The \""""CUBE\"""" section is the juniors clothing.\n\nThe dressing rooms are sooo nice, much like one that you would find in a nice boutique. There were two hanging hooks in there, one marked \""""definitely\"""" and the other \""""tomorrow\"""". Cute, right?\n\nI'm coming back!"""
"After an afternoon Pirates game, 3 of us sat up at the sushi bar and ordered fairly common sushi and sashimi. It was fresh and tasty. We also ordered a bowl of chicken fried rice that my husband claimed was the best he had ever had ( I think they cooked it with a LOT of butter). We watched the sushi chefs prepare way more interesting looking dishes while we waited for our food and enjoyed the atmosphere. Our waitress, Lauren, was a giant bag. That is my only complaint.  Not sure if we were just really luck to get the 3 seats as we walked in or what??  There was a constant line up in the waiting area so maybe we were lucky."
"Green tea smoothie with boba. Oh my lord. I wanna bathe myself in this. The drink is on point !!! But, they need to turn up the AC up in this mug!"
"This is my go to chinese restaurant! I love the spicy mixed vegetables and the sweet and sour chicken. ITS REALLY CHICKEN TOO! lol\n\nclean\nfriendly service\n\nthe cooks in the back are weird, they stare!"
"Early Sunday morning no one there, but that means fewer check-outs open.  Now that they have re- configured the store, no longer able to go in through garden center and pick up pet supplies or health, beauty supplies quickly.\n\nIt's also a darn shame they decreaseed the craft suppies like fabrics.  Still cheapest prices overall."
"Ok, so you don't get the spa experience, but for the price of a 60 minute massage you cannot beat Massage Pro. You can purchase a package of five massages for the price of four, which works out to be just $40/hour. Amazing! Since both locations are essentially run by independent contractors, you can't be sure how experienced your therapist will be, but I can recommend two that I love. At the Sahara location, Soni is fantastic. Her style is soothing and her heart is warm. At the Buffalo and Washington location (in the Longford Medical Center) Naomi is the person to request. I have been going to her for years and she works wonders on my back. She truly is the 'oriental healing star' she defines herself as and is sweet as can be."
"Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop...\n\nin a church setting.\n\nNot like hofbrauhaus, however it is still a very nice place to go. The ambience however is kind of odd, but if you like beer, it is worth a trip definitely."
"Finally, a feminist, body positive sex shop that doesn't make you feel like crap. You can tell that the staff is very passionate about what they do and the store is designed to make your visit as comfortable as possible. It is a bit pricy, but there is a huge and thorough selection with lots and lots of information about the products. There are also complimentary informational brochures about topics on sexual health, practices, and exploration. I feel like this is a much needed business in Madison and in the world!"
I am not really a pizza person and I was kind of worried about going to a restaurant that specialized in pizza.. But I was pleasently surprised! \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a weeknight and it was so great! We ordered hummus before our actual meal and the hummus was so warm and the bread taste like it was made right there in the kitchen! It was so good! \n\nWe then ordered our pizza and it was a perfect size for just us two and we even took some home! The service was so great and they were attentive with out over doing it! It was such a great experience and I will be back for sure!
"the only two items i have sampled at eribertos have been the huevos rancheros,which i really liked. plus, they give you 3 overmedium eggs, instead of 2 scrambled..which is to my liking. the beans do no have much flavor, nor does the rice, but the pico de gallo and ranchero sauce more than make up for it.  the other dish i;ve had are the nachos with carne asada. also filling and fun to eat. other items i would choose to eat at other close by, higher end restaurants. i do check the health ratings, and while the county was doing them, they fared ok. but it's definitely a take out joint..no place you want to eat in."
"What's not to say here about Paper Skyscraper.  It's a great place to spend time if you want to waste some time and can't think of anything to do.  I promise you, you could spend a solid hour in here just browsing all the cool quirky items.  Their stock really runs the gambit from greeting cards (that are hilarious by the way) to adult toys and games.  There is also a great selection of historical books on Dilworth and the Charlotte area for those that want to know more about the area they live in.  I know that I will be back to get that hard to find birthday gift for that someone that really has everything already.  I can guarantee you that you will find something they absolutely don't already have here!"
"this place is awesome, just want to write a quick review. there pharmacy staff is great. my son had really bad allergy and one of the techs. skinny (asian) young gal with long hair walked my down the isle and showed me what i needed. and got me in and out of the store in a short timely matter. great service!!!"
Paid $20 cash for a smog here.\n\nIn and out fairly quickly...drive-thru style setup.\n\nService guy was friendly and talkative...gave him a couple bucks for the extra effort.\n\nRecommended if you are nearby!
"There are few options downtown for a burger and this place kicks the crap out of any others. It is better than any other burger in Phoenix really. Try the BMW burger if you're hungry. Perfectly balanced with meat, cheese, BBQ sauce and flavor. Not to mention the owner works the register at lunch and builds great rapport with guests."
"I've always liked this pizza but it's grown on me even more over the past few months.  I love the atmosphere of Times Square down the street, but sometimes there pizza has too much cheese on it and they don't always cook it well done when I ask.  So I've found myself ordering in Jojo's more and more.  I love the taste of the sauce and it has just the right amount of cheese!  They've got great salads too.  The delivery men are always friendly and arrive in a timely manner."
"I have the utmost respect for Dr. Teng . He is truly the most caring and competent physician I have ever seen. Always on call and never too busy to take charge at anytime N/D. He got me through a very difficult time and I know if I needed him right now he would be at the other end of the phone or meeting me at the hospital. He is a man with a true commitment to his profession and the finest Dr. and gentlemen I have ever met. His brother works hand in hand with as his antheisologist and also a true professional. Office staff caring, competent, and always ready to make things work. As you can see I wish I could go to him for everything that was in need of attention. I wish him and all his staff the best always and look forward  to my follow up visit in a couple of months. one other point of information. Always has a can do and wonderful attitude. Thank you Dr. Teng You saved my life. Thanks again \nSteve & Hobie Hellerstein"
"I feel guilty that I have never reviewed Cabo Fish Taco before because it is my favorite place! I love this place and I always take people here when they come to visit. My favorites are the BBQ mahi tacos, lemon grilled shrimp tacos and the mahi maui burrito but you really can't go wrong here. My fiance loves the rasta pasta. The guacamole is also delicious. The only thing that is sometimes a downside to this place is that it can get really loud in the restaurant which makes it hard to talk at dinner. Also, since it is so tasty, sometimes you have to wait awhile for a table. But it is SO worth it!"
"The full blown Hemi southern style with chili was really good but I have to say the triple burgers were a little over cooked.  Don't get me wrong, I like my hamburger done but when its over cooked it gets dry and that was the case here the other night.  Still pretty tasty when you're half buzzed!\n\nThe fried picks were tasty as usual and I was very surprised at how good the hushpuppies were.  They were a favorite at our table.  I also had a bite of a corn dog that was really good.  They use their own batter for the corn dogs instead of the generic frozen stuff."
"Growing up listening to punk rock and going to some of the dingiest venues I'm quite partial to Tremont. It's a pretty large venue that has two rooms. They open them both up for really big shows but mostly just use the main room.\n\nThe bartenders are rather good a keeping a drink in your hand and manage a full bar rather well. The bathrooms are a little dismal but what do you expect at a punk rock venue.\n\nThere is plenty of room inside and outside. Also, they have pinball games, Starwars pinball no less. All and all you can catch a good show and really enjoy it and just relax and be happy. I'll definitely be going back here."
"I don't know WHY the only review here gives this place 1-star! I got GREAT SERVICE!  Came on a Saturday afternoon, and bought 2 cases of beer along with some liquor and a few bottles of water... the cashier spoke great English, rang me up quickly, and even offered to help me out to my car with my purchases. Cool beans.\n\n(If you lose your phone in a liquor store, that sounds like a personal problem.)"
"As my quest continues I ventured to John Mull's. I had several co-workers tell me about the place and the reviews are positive. Sadly it is on the other side of town from me but I was on that side and the opportunity was there. When I got there the place was packed. I looked over the menu while I waited. The line moved really fast and when it was my turn to order I got the 3 meat combo. I got ribs, brisket and pulled pork. My sides were mac and cheese, potato salad and beans.  The meats were amazing, very tender and flavorful. The only thing I didn't like (for my taste) the ribs had a bit of a spicy kick to them. The brisket and pulled pork were fantastic. The mac and cheese was the best I've had in along time. The other sides had way to much vinegar flavor to my liking. I will definitely be back but only if I'm in the area."
The best coffee place in sq hill. And they had the best cookies. But at the end of last year they changed their cookies to be smaller and harder. But if they changed back their cookies they would earn the last star!
"""I was very happy with my Petsmart experience. I wanted to  buy a  pet for my (highly allergic)boyfriend as a birthday present. After much deliberation and about a zillion questions, we(the Petsmart girl and I) decided that a tortoise would be a perfect match--unlike the turtle that I had originally considered. In the four or five trips made to do research and buy the supplies for his \""""tortoise condo\"""" we created, I found that three of the employees we talked to were very knowledgeable on the subject. They were super helpful and patient with us. I also went to another local pet store twice, it seemed pretty ghetto and no one even approached me to ask if I needed help! We'll be Petsmart frequents, I'm sure!"""
"Strategically situated across from the Food Court, we sometimes walk past this place as we make our way to the other side of the shopping center. Usually we don't pay it any attention. But recently we got a chunk of fudge here- chocolate peanut butter. It's weighed individually. The pieces are huge! I think our block was around $7.00. I'm not a chocoholic like my husband, but I still rather enjoyed it- creamy and rich. (FYI, I love the chocolate and peanut butter combination. It's my favorite.) The looks on people passing us while walking and eating bites of the scrumptious fudge, was pretty funny; y'know that they wanted some fudge, too! It was a nice indulgence- you gotta treat yourself sometimes, right?\n\nThe store itself seems small from its appearance on the outside. But once inside you will see that there is seating on both sides of the store. There is such a large variety of different kinds of fudge. They are generously cut and individually weighed. Also serves other sweets and drinks. Even towards the end of the night, the cashier was pleasant and friendly."
"""Eat here occasionally.  Never had a problem with an order or the servers.  Typical asian service, quick and no small talk.  We (GF and I) come for the lunch specials, a crazy amount of food for the price.  Here's a tip, 1 full order is more than enough for 2 people, so you can really save $ and get an appetizer.  I like there sweet and sour chicken.  I wont go as far as to say that this is AUTHENTIC Chinese food, but its perfect for a typical Americans idea of \""""Chinese food.\""""  4 stars all the time!"""
"They do a super job.  They aren't the most inexpensive out there, but they never over fix!  Jeff in the.office is patient and helpful.  I highly recommend them!"
"""I have been going to Monterrey since they opened nearly 20 yrs ago. The food is excellent. My favorite is the chimichangas both chicken and shredded beef but I have tried nearly everything and its all good. Love the fajitas, beef or chicken (skip the shrimp), tacos de asada, pollo con crema, pollo con queso, as well as any of their combinations. Oh, and you can't go wrong with just a couple chicken soft tacos ala cart, they are delicious. For those who have complained that it's not authentic Mexican food - your point is? I have been to at least 20 Mexican restaurants in Charlotte including many \""""authentic\"""" ones where they don't even have an English menu. I like some of the food at these places but always come back to Monterrey."""
"As I perused the menu at the bar of 300 East, I noticed who I assumed to be the chef sitting nearby doing paperwork. I saw an intriguing selection on the menu: Farro Saute which was a mixture of farro, wild mushrooms, butternut squash and kale. Not caring for mushrooms (yeah, I know.....) I turned to the woman and asked if she thought the chef would consider substituting something for the mushrooms. She understood my humor and asked how I liked roasted beets. I said absolutely! So she was very willing to please. The beets were a very nice substitution even though the entire dish was pink! Didn't mind a-tall. \n\nIn addition to the farro saute, I ordered a cup of her split pea soup (almost as good as mine) -  so good I enjoyed it all the way home and had it finished before I hit the driveway.\n\nEither I'm really blind or TV at the bar dim and hard to see. \n\nI definitely recommend 300 East. In fact, I have a group visiting this week."
"We go to basketball games here, NBA exhibition and Olympic practices. I'd give it five stars but the parking makes it hard to get out unless you park near the exit which makes for a long walk to the stadium.  Great hotdogs and friendly staff. ;)"
"Most women like shopping for shoes and clothes. However I am a fan of sheets, towels, and comforters. Yes, I have a large collection because I am always changing my theme. Somehow I was searching for the craft store and I came across Anna's Linens. They had a sale for 500 thread sheets so i had to buy several sets as well as a new downs-comforter since it is cold in vegas. I will be return after the holidays to buy more things for my new place."
"""One of the last old school restaurants in Charlotte.  Up until the Montford takeover, I would go to the old smokehouse for my Que fix.  Now Bill Spoons is where its at.  Fantastic service, friendly greeting and they make you feel like a regular even if your not.  \n\nDont expect an extravagant menu.  Chicken, pork and one fish item.  But heck, if you expected more then you obviously cannot appreciate the old fashion BBQ establishments.  \n\nEnjoy it! It is nothing short of down home greatness.\n\nPs.  They have eastern and western nc sauce and the counter lady is great.  As I am deciding on my sides she steps back and verbally puts my order in minus the sides so it will be working and I can leave faster.  Like duh, everybody should do that, but they dont.\n\nIts official. \""""Best onion rings in Charlotte!\""""  Sweet Vidalia onions, cut thick, hand breaded and crunchy. But not crunchy batter wise, crunchy onion!   Cooked just right.  I dare you to prove me wrong, these are the best in Charlotte."""
"I visited Jack's on a particularly busy night. It was shoulder to shoulder everywhere on the Southside that night, which definitely made a difference in the experience. I'll try to keep this in mind when I review Jack's.\n\nJack's has an interesting look. Its a nice little bar with hand written signs on the walls- not cluttered but getting crowded. It's gimmicky but not tacky, which is a hard balance to find. Their drink prices are untouchable, they are seriously sooooooo cheap. Pitchers of shots are like $12. It's ridiculous. We stayed here for about an hour before moving on. I think the smoke and the fact that the pool tables were covered up were the only complaints I noted. All things considered, Jack's is a great place to start the night. On a less crowded night, I can see myself enjoying it a lot more."
"I really enjoyed this sushi restaurant. It reminded me in a good way of some of the places I miss from California. The menu was varied and interesting, and the sashimi was delicious, fresh, and perfectly cut. I got the larger plate of sashimi and it was very generously portioned.\n\nIt's expensive, yes, but I expect that with good quality fish outside of the west coast. I will be returning for special meals--it's a little too pricey to be my every week sushi joint.\n\nOther comments about the wait time were accurate--definitely go early and have the whole party there.\n\nThe BYOB policy is annoying. We just decided to forego wine or sake rather than deal with paying to use a glass. In my opinion, places should either charge a corkage fee or be BYOB only--not do both.\n\nEdited: Went back a second time with the parents and was not disappointed. Great sushi rolls! Simple ones tasted really good. The shrimp tempura was also excellent. The chicken katsu was so-so, so I recommend sticking to fish. This place is a little difficult for the non sushi-lover or non fish-lover, but I really enjoy it."
"I was really surprised at this place. They have a few beers on tap that are made in Vegas and the bartender was cool enough to put the Kings game on. He even changed the audio to it as well. Prices were very reasonable and even served beers in proper glassware. Basically, it looks like they give a crap.\n\nGood times!"
Excellent flavorful food! The best chicken yellow curry I've had. Chicken fell apart as though it had been slow cooked. Cinnamon in the sauce. Many vegetarian recipes. Companion loved the vegetarian chef's special. Caution on spiciness - you are asked to choose heat from 1-10. I got a 7 and my tongue is still numb. And I love super spicy! Err on the low side.
"One of my favorite places in the world. I remember a friends mom bringing me here when I about fifteen and I never had money to go, or time...but when I get down there it is the random treat. The boyfriend prefers froyo to custard...I know, I know, but I love him and have to pretend to respect his opinions. Because custard can drop kick some froyo in the teeth and take its purse. \n\nThis place is great. I dont mind the bad neighborhood, it gives it some ambiance. If you can't accept ghetto Vegas at its worst, you don't deserve it at its best! \n\nThey have different flavors every day, and make sure you bring cash or you will be directed to the lovely convenience store across the parking lot, and possibly score some crack at the same time.  \n\nGoing here is always a visit to real vegas, and te best place to go when I am down."
"My favorite sushi place in town. Love all their rolls, they fish are really fresh and the chefs there are very creative. Everything I even try there are very yummy. The services are alway friendly. And they open late at night. This is one of those hidden neighborhood jem.\n\nALSO, lots of bad reviews regarding Osake are for the other one by Lake Mead, most people mistake the two. I been to that one too and they are one of the worst. It's night and day. Please don't let that mislead you."
"""Love it!  \n\nGreat atmosphere, such a neat place to be.  Then the burger and fries are awesome.  The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because I want to go back and tell them how I wanted my burger cooked, I'm not a fan of \""""well\"""" which predictably is apparently their default.  I heard the onion rings are great also so I look forward to trying them also.  \n\nIt appears to get really busy so if you can get there a little ahead of the rush."""
"I had to use these guys again...stellar!! Again, honest...great..reasonably priced!  They show up same day, no extra fees...no extra anything...just great people! Fixed ac same day (had to fix what the prior ac guy fixed 3 times) when I said oh yeah fixed that 3 times....he looked at me sideways....i had to say.....NOT FROM YOU!!....They are GOLDEN!"
"Good food, good service, you'd be crazy not to try it."
"I have had an account with One Nevada (formerly Nevada Federal Credit Union) for almost 21 years now and have always had exemplary service. Have been with them through two auto loans (both professionally and rapidly handled) and an identity theft where both my checking and savings accounts were cleaned out (they restored all of the stolen funds in less than 48 hours).\n\nThe Lake Mead branch is not a full-service branch (no tellers); however, the staff on hand is always most accommodating and friendly. When I had a possible security breach on my debit card about a year ago, I went in and the card was replaced in less than ten minutes! (I was sure I'd have to wait 7-10 days to get a new card.) I am a very satisfied accountholder and plan to stay with this credit union for a long time to come."
"The place doesn't look too fancy, nor the interior fresh, but it's the food I go for, so I simply overlook the outdated colors and carpet!  \n\nDecent food, great service, always good food.  Today, we had the pork with steam bun, sold by the 1/2 dozen, minute chicken with cake noodle, sweet and sour shrimp, and a stuffed tofu.  All were seasoned well, and as usually, the service was great."
"I LUV-IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nFrozen Custard is made of eggs. So... to those who aren't into eggey things..... be careful!\n\nBut because it is made of eggs.... it has a reallllyyyyy riCh taste & texture. It's heavier than ice cream and fro yo, but It doesn't taste like ice cream, or frozen yogurt...it's FROZEN CUSTARD! \n\nMy friends and I went on a weekday probably around 3pm. No one was there, which meant...I get to order really fast! =) the gentleman who was the manager..was very open to sharing with me what LuV-Its was and what flavors they had available that day. They don't serve ALL the flavors in a single day. it varies because they wanna keep the frozen custard fresh. \n\nanyway... I liked it!! \n\n=D"
The view from the top is breath-taking. We parked at the top (1220 Grandivew) and took the ride to the bottom anyway. I don't think it was necessarily worth the trip but we were tourists and did it anyway. Go for the view.
"Much better pricing than Biggs although their selection is smaller.  Theyre also a lot friendlier and have competitive prices to b&h and amazon on bogen and loewpro bags. Good store for trying out gear before you use it, but i havent had prints done here."
Dont go!! Thought we were in for a treat with the 4 star rating and no negative feedback. We ordered pork and ribs - Very disappointed. Pork ribs tough and the pork meat was minced. Beans canned. Slaw had too much relish. Nealbwas saved by hush puppies.
"I love that this location is right off the freeway so it is easy off, easy on.  I have to say that I have never been inside.  So I can only say that the times that I have been here there has been no line for the ATM, they are always in working order and the area is always clean. \nThe turn to get to the ATM can be a little strange if you are entering on the Rainbow side of the building. You almost have to drive in and then make a U-Turn, unless there are no cars in the parking lot."
"""Whenever we're in the area (which is infrequently), we come to Rita's. The chips and salsa are great - though a little too spicy for my gringo husband.\nI have enjoyed both entrees I've purchased (the carne adobada and the combo with the beef tamale, shrimp taco and chicken enchilada). My husband got a little more adventurous (and expensive) and got the Azteca and didn't care for it.\nAlso have to disagree with other Yelpers on the Toritos. They aren't extremely tasty with the exception of the sauce - and we took the extra sauce home because there was way too much of it and we used it as steak sauce. I wish they would bottle it and sell it separately!\nMargaritas are also tasty, but not extremely strong. Go and support your local AZ businesspeople. To me, it's better than Valle Luna and many other self-proclaimed \""""authentic\"""" joints."""
"Not only are the prices greater then other places but they are very patient and understanding of your skill level and needs. I took about 4 lessons because im a quick learner but each lesson the instructors taught me something new and provided an easy method that helped me learn  from parking, U turning, Left hand turns.They made me feel confident by the time my road test came.They are great and genuinely care."
"This is the first place I come when I want fun/unique gifts that are not grossly over-priced.  Even if I don't find anything in the way of a gift, I do have a good time looking around at all the cool stuff they always have!"
"My hands down favorite bar in South Side.I have been going to Ruggers for 3 years now the place is the shit. First they got an amazing beer selection that always changes. Next to that, beer is pretty damage cheap which is a win. Food is good too, go on a Tuesday if you can get a spot and you can make your own hamburger for practically nothing. My college favorite was a hamburger pattie, chicken filet, onions, tomato, lettuce, french fries, jalepanoes, pepperjack cheese, and buffalo sauce with a side of fried patios. This thing was so big it could barely fit in my mouth. I think with all of those extra ingredients the total cost with a Yuengling was $9 on Tuesday. The place fills up so you have to go early on Tuesday. But overall they have great happy hour specials during the entire week that are must to go to."
"""Ok so I'm an east coast transplant who absolutely loves a good slice of pizza. I've tried a few places that claimed to be \""""New York\"""" style but none of them came close until I came across Broadway Pizza. It's a little slice of heaven that soooo reminds me home. I like to come here pretty often for lunch. Luckily it's a few minutes from my office. Don't come here looking for fancy decor. Not much to look at on the inside. It's a pizza shop. Doesn't try to be anything it's not. The slices are big and the toppings are generous. And the cheese... ah the cheese. It's just right. I can't say how many times I've had pizzas here and the cheese just seems kind of goopy. Also try the garlic knots. They are a must! Even if you aren't in the mood for pizza, you cannot leave there without at least trying one."""
"Bikini: Where everybody knows your face. Or they should know it if you go there twice or thrice a week on average. And why shouldn't you? It's practically a tropical island oasis with flowing pitchers of delicious, cold, golden Blue Moon. Or Bud, Hein, or Pabst...if you're crazy like that. They painted th bathrooms recently. There are always christmas lights twinkling  in the eyes of the goddesses behind the bar. Aloha."
"""Been there for parts and they had lots in stock. Good prices too. The tech knew his stuff and knew exactly what I needed and even told me how to do the work myself.\nThe shop is way cool with lots of bikes and accessories. The most awe inspiring feature, other than the 100 year location, is the interior artwork. I was told it was done by a young reformed \""""grafitti artist\"""" who turned his tallents towards niceness rather than evil. Beautiful artwork indeed.\nOnly lost one star cuz Trek bikes just don't do it for me and no Specialized bikes at all."""
My favorite one in Charlotte b/c it is not in a strip mall.  Parking can be tricky but you can always find it on the street.
"We renewed our vows here yesterday, and it was a fantastic experience! The minister (a young brown-haired female) was sincere and genuine and very kind. We went at 4:30pm and didn't wait long at all. The staff was so kind and helpful. The price was also very reasonable ($60). When we got out of the chapel, there was quite a line. I read the other reviews about people complaining about the wait- this is the most famous wedding chapel in Vegas, you're probably going to wait. But it's super vintage and nostalgic of a legit Vegas chapel. Only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that the carpets need cleaned desperately. The chapel was kind of dirty."
"I was craving halo halo so I found this place on yelp.  Came in and ordered a halo halo and of course, Lumpia. 8 pieces an order for $4.  I ended up ordering two orders of Lumpia, because who can resist?\n\nThe wait was a little long, but it was worth it since everything was fresh! The lady working was so sweet and made me feel right at home.  Halo halo was perfect!"
I hear you are supporting the protesters!  5 stars for the props!
The Rococo Chicago style pizza is my guilty pleasure. - big chunks of tomato and sausage.  I get it every time my wife and son are away.  I just need to make sure I get rid of the evidence before they get home!
"Enrico always does a great job. He is almost always in a hurry due to the steady stream of customers coming through his door, but fear not, Enrico's quality never falters. A haircut is 18$, which can be expensive for college students in Oakland. However I truly believe he is superior to any other barbers in the area."
"""Best Pizza, bar none, in the city. A gooey, greasy, incredibly flavorful pie (thin crust of course). I used to drive one home all the time when I lived in Ohio. I had to put the pizza in the trunk ('cause in the backseat it was torture driving home). If ya haven't had a \""""cut\"""", go NOW."""
"Most people would think a pub would be a bit stuffy and serve exclusively fried food, but Sir Ed's really breaks the mold!\nTucked behind the Harris Teeter in Park Road Shopping center, this place is really a treat! They have a very diverse menu that includes several vegetarian entrees. My personal favorite is the zucchini cake with ratatouille. It hits the spot and keeps you full without feeling ver indulgent. My friends usually order the ostrich meatloaf, but it is a bit much for me. \nThe bar is always a hit, with surprising local beer choices on tap along with the usual suspects like Guinness.\nSir Ed's also sports a nice patio for mild days and a dart board in the back for play time."

"""I first came to the Beehive 3 years ago - wow! the E. Carson area changed a lot since then - traffic, parking meters everywhere, and a zillion people (where do they all come from??). The Beehive has changed a bit with wireless, more tables and chairs... but it's still a fun atmosphere with good music, coffee, and food. Excellent for sitting around with the laptop, maybe reading, people watching, and conversation eavesdropping. And yeah, some of the clientele may be \""""without real jobs,\"""" (whatever that means...), \""""hippies,\"""" (sorry, I live near Woodstock, NY and the people here are not hippies...) and \""""goths,\"""" (like Marilyn Manson and the Columbine kids?) but that's what makes it fun and interesting. If you want something a little less bi-polar maybe one of the cafes near Shadyside is a better choice. \n\nI'm just bummed that I didn't buy one of the Beehive t-shirts the last time I was here as they no longer have them. :-("""
"I own and operate a mobile DJ company. MC Audio is my GO TO place for all of my gear needs. These guys not only know their stuff, but have great customer support and top notch pricing. I've never been anything less that totally happy with my purchases there, and I've spent thousands of dollars on speakers, controllers, lights and more. \n\nDO NOT buy at guitar center or even amazon until you give these guys a chance to beat the price. I've never even had to ask and the prices always come in less than others."
"We stayed here over the weekend for a wedding and everything was great.\n\nThe location is GREAT.  It is in the center of everything.\n\nThe staff is outstanding.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.\n\nThe rooms were comfortable with good beds, pillows, and sheets.\n\nParking is $13 per night, and while there are metered parking spaces close by it is easier to just pay for the parking.\n\nThe elevators were ridiculously slow, but I don't think that is the hotel's fault.\n\nI also didn't really like the way the tap water tastes, but they do give you 2 free bottles of water.\n\nThe hot tub was large, but the pool was tiny.  The workout room was small, but seemed adequate."
Had a great experience. DId not feel gouged or pressured and our dog got the proper treatment for dehydration.  Friendly staff. Prompt service. Special attention from Dr. Heinritz appreciated. Very professional.
"Love this place.  They have a little bit of everything.  If you need one nail, you can buy just one nail.  The staff is extremely helpful. They know about plants, seeds and hardware.  Describe your home repair project, and they will tell you what you need to do the job.  They have some items that have been discontinued and can't be found anywhere else."
"very cheerful waitress. talk alot.\nthe food is okay.  I never had German food so I can't commend on it.\nportion is large.\nI order a sweet beer, forgot the name. it was good!"
"I am SO shocked to know I haven't reviewed this place yet. I probably go here most out of any other coffee shop! And always for their chai. Their chai is so good, it beats Amelie's chai's butt. As does their hot chocolate, yum! They used to carry really yummy Italian sodas and ice creams but stopped it. \nThe highlight of this place is their outdoor seating on a beautiful day, but even the inside is cute and cozy. My favorite thing to do on a weekend morning is to get a cup of chai at Smelly and walk down N. Davidson looking at the quaint little shops. \nHowever nothing beats hanging out here on Friday and Saturday nights until 12am during warmer months."
"I've had a soft spot for Lava Lounge for years. It's a great bar/club that's a bit off beat. The punk/alternative crowd dominates the clientele here, but anyone outside of that demographic need not feel intimidated. I've been here in ratty jeans and a t-shirt as well as in business casual attire and was treated the same. If you want to just drink and/or spend your time however you please then you'll be treated fairly; it's a pretty cool crowd. Thumbs down for the smoking."
"Five stars to the food.  Sesame chicken (ask for it spicy and extra crispy) has a different (and better) flavor than anywhere across 9 states.  I think there is a subtle peanut-buttery-ness to it.  When I go to Charlotte (used to live there), this is where I want to eat.  \n\nThe place has looked better in the past.  It's dirty looking inside, but I don't care.  Crispy Szechuan Beef, the Sesame Chicken family of dishes (Chicken Honey Walnuts, General Tso, Sesame Beef are all in the same sauce with tiny variations), the brown sauce and I love that the veggies still have a crisp to them after being cooked."
"I LOVE THIS BAR!  I wish that I could put it in my pocket, and take it back to Los Angeles with me.  Gooski's has hands down the best jukebox that I have ever had the pleasure of bullying.  \n\nSide note:  jukebox bullying is when you put in a crap ton of money in to guarantee listening to your own tunes while drinking.  This can annoy other bar patrons, but you can be assured that you will be listening to good music.\n\nBack the review, I bullied with Talking Heads, ELO, Pixies, Beck, MGMT, Bo Diddly, Ray  Charles, The Clash, and much much more.  Maybe no one else wanted to hear Road to Nowhere, but I had a fantastic time.\n\nOn top of the eclectic jukebox, the drinks are incredibly cheap!! Jameson and Gingers for 4 bucks? SOLD!  I hear the beer selection is great as well, which I am not surprised in a city like Pittsburgh.  \n\nI will be making many repeat appearances in the next couple of months.  I love you Gooski's!!"
"One of the best Chinese food joints in the city. Everything i've ever gotten here has been amazing EXCEPT anything including their bean curd. Instead of cutting it up into manageable sized pieces that absorb the flavor, they throw in big fat pieces. \n\nGet the egg rolls, seriously."
The food is delicious at any hour of the day. I can't say much more besides just go there and try to finish your pancakes. You'll be beyond full but you'll keep trying to finish them. Get the oreo ones and thank me later.
"""WHAT A RELIEF!! Just moved out here from LA ..needed a new barber and instead of hopping from barber to barber risking getting my hair messed up, I trusted Yelp with helping me find a decent barber. \nLet me just say I'm glad I did, after reading the reviews of this place. \nI came in early (around 10 on a Tuesday) signed in and though there were already a few customers already there, there still was no wait. My barber was cool and struck up a chill conversation so it wasn't awkward silence the whole time and to my \""""surprise\"""" despite how picky I am he cut my hair spot on! Definitely coming back again!"""
"I severely limit my intake of bovine (cows) milk, so when I heard about Ronald's donuts vegan donuts I had to have one.\n\nAfter scoffing at the name (McDonald's anyone?) I found that their vegan donuts are amazing. If you are vegan and have not tried this donuts, stop what you are doing and head to this store.\n\nTastes like Krispy Kreme. =D"
"Hugo was great, He has been there for 11 years and he knows how to cut hair, old school.  I felt he did a great job at all the classic details right down to the hot lather shave of the back of my neck and sideburns for a really crisp edge.  He made sure my brows were not bushy and that no stray hairs were growing out of my ears.  I have not had such a professional and enjoyable haircut in years and wanted to share the experience. While I was there a steady flow of people came in, The other Barber while I didn't catch his name seemed equally professional.  This is a Barbershop the old fashion way, a place for all kind of guys to get the haircut they are looking for"
"This is a friendly Starbucks.  Obviously most people know what a Starbucks is so I won't bore you with details.  The staff is friendly.  After a couple of visits, they remember your name.  It's pretty spacious inside.  I never stay too long but you always see people congregating and working or chatting, so it's a friendly atmosphere..\nThey usually have free samples of some pastry or drink so you can try different things out.  They even have a drive thru.  One time I went through there and got a free coupon cause it took too long.  But it really wasn't too long, but free coupons are always nice."
"The selection and hours are enough to earn a few stars in my book. But any place you can get a pierogi pizza and six pack of Four Loko on a Sunday gets my approval. The best pizza in Greenfield, and, for me, rivals Aiello's in Squirrel Hill. \n\nI had the pirogie pizza. It was as warm and inviting as the service and as hot and dense as a dying star. The potatoes were piled generously is what I'm getting at. \n\nThey would easily be a five star place but it was just a bit on the pricey side and they could do with a couple more chairs. But those aren't things I'd be super concerned about."
"Stayed here for four nights for my son's national mock trial championship so there were lots of teenagers. Even so the rooms seemed well insulated. Front desk and housekeeping service was very good. Rooms were nice and relatively large. A couple restaurants close by. Short walk to baseball and basketball venues as well as light rail.  I recommend light rail to/from airport as it is cheap. You will have to pull your bags a couple blocks though. Cab ride to airport is about $17 without tip. Area seemed safe. Mysteriously uncrowded even during the week. Really dead during the weekend and some businesses shut down completely. They charge for Internet which is never good. Overall, this is a nice business hotel that is very convenient to downtown attractions and light rail (which is quite nice)."
"This place is amazing!  The doctors and staff are all extremely nice!  My dog needed some extensive dental work done, but we are on a tight budget.  Amazingly, they were able to work with us and figure a way for us to get the work done.  I will be a lifetime customer of theirs for this, and will recommend anyone I know to go here.  You really can't find a better place to trust with your pets!!!"
For all of you with kids - remember the scene from ratatouille where Anton Ego has the meal of his life? All I have to say is boneless short ribs.  I was speechless. Great job John.
"This place is a nice neighborhood joint. We popped in for some lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Bar was reasonably busy with a handful of regulars at the bar. We grabbed a table next to the bar. The bartender was our server. I'm not sure of we had the bartender that others have said was not pleasant, but ours was nice to us. \nMenu was decent, with typical bar food. Food was good. I had a turkey club sandwich and fries. Big sandwich and fresh fries. Me likey!!! \nHonestly, my only complaint would be that they allow smoking. As a former smoker, going into a place that reeks of cigarettes makes me want to gag. People were chain smoking at the bar, so it just made it that much more worse. \nI would possibly go back, bc the food was yummy. May bring an oxygen mask though."
"The girls that work at this location are so friendly and sweet. Any time I forget my rewards coupon, they're willing to still give me the discount. The lines always go quickly, and I feel like they always have what I am looking for. I love Ulta. So amazing!! :)"
"I just had the best interview with Ms Townsend.  Not only was she kind, she was just brilliant in the analysis of my employment issue. Even though I was calling for a friend, and from out of state, she took the time to direct me (and my friend) to another attorney who could best serve our needs."
"We had purchased a living social for Shun Lee since we just moved to the Cotswold area.  But then read these reviews and were a bit scared to try.  Well i gotta say we tried tonight and it was really good.  It is a hidden gem.  The food was excellent, the service was great.  We had a spicy entree and a sweet one.  SO good.  My husbannd and I will be back for sure.  If you are hesitant .. don't be just go try ... :)"
Swanky. Casual. Cool.\n\nGreenbush delivers with high-quality drinks and a hip atmosphere minus the pretension. I'm sure things other than the sour Old Fashioneds are delicious... I'll update later if I ever fall out of love with my brandy cocktail of choice. A neat place to sit at the bar with friends and feel like you belong in another decade.
"I have gone to this place forever. They are really great. Most that go there have their favorite nail techs, I personally love Tina and Leann, but after having my nails done by almost everyone there, I can say with confidence that if you tell them what you want they will try their hardest to deliver. Sometimes it can be a tiny bit difficult to explain clearly because many of them have accents, however, that is not a problem at all and they do a great job once they know what you want.\n\nAnother thing I really like about this salon is that if something goes wrong, ie. a nail breaks or something falls off, or just any accident really, they are happy to have you drop in any time and fix it right up for you. They work hard after hours even if I walk in 10 minutes before closing time for a 40 minute job. Really hard working people!\n\nOh yeah, and the pedicures with leg massage are sooo relaxing!"
"I go to Murray Avenue Kosher quite often to pick up fish, bread and on occasion the prepared deli foods which are usually high quality.  The service especially at the checkout counter is not customer friendly but not intentionally rude.  I really like the kosher wine section as well as the large selection of smoked fish and kosher cheeses. Be prepared to pay higher prices than at the general supermarkets ( kosher is generally more costly everywhere).  While the service may not be over friendly (although I have never really had a problem) I have always found the other customers to be both polite and often friendly."
"I make a point of stopping here when I visit. A big part of the appeal is the homemadeness, the unimpressive surroundings, the neighborhoody feel. The ice cream is very good, but there is more to it than that. And yes, everyone else is right about the  waffle cones. Get one."
"""My room was nice. It had a small refrigerator, a microwave, and even two stove burners (which would have been really great if they had pots and pans). The AC was quiet and functioned well. I've been in better hotel exercise rooms, but you get access to the Y which is just a few minutes down the road. Good location near a mall, shops, and restaurants, but not so good if you want to be in the downtown area. Easy access to the beltline as well. My room was very dark and quiet which made for great sleeping. The TV seemed to have a mind of its own - the \""""previous channel\"""" button on the remote didn't always go back to the previous channel and when I put in a channel number, it didn't always go to that channel."""
"""Dr. Kay has been really fantastic with our two adopted dogs. My expectations have been exceeded several times now. Also, for the care they receive when here, the fees are very reasonable. \n\nRecently a relative was telling me how their vet wouldn't even clip her dog's nails when she asked - instead he replied \""""You want that, go to a groomer - it's not what I became a vet to do\"""" and she continues to go there because the price is cheap. Fortunately, at Companion Animal Hospital, you will receive terrific care, without the attitude, and without spending a fortune."""
"Went in for a quote, which they gave me immediately, and set up an appointment for the repair on the spot. Fast and friendly."
"when we saw that the noodle bar that the mandalay bay was charging upwards of $15 for a simple bowl of soup, we jumped in the car and drove a mere 10 minutes to spring valley's chinatown. \n\ngood broth, served piping hot. good, springy noodles and fresh accompanying vegetables. and this place served cuts of beef of commendable quality in the soup. \n\nca fe sua da was more potent than sweet (not necessarily a bad thing)."
"Visiting Pittsburgh, we were looking for a cheap and quick fix for our hunger. We came across this noodle shop near the library. It was rather cold at the time and soup sounded delish! It took them a while to make our food even though it was not that busy. Their selections in food varied, which may or may not be a good thing. The service was decent and the atmosphere was bright and open. Their green tea was not what I had anticipated however, but it was nice way to get some warmth in my hungry tummy at the time. \n\nAs far as the food quality goes, i would definitely say I've had far better ramen, but for the price I suppose it would suffice. This definitely would not be the first restaurant that I would suggest to people, but for their uber cheap price, you cant go wrong."
"Ricardo Z is your man!\n\nService with Ricardo and Presidential Limo was prompt, courteous, and professional. \nRicardo was helpful, fun, and easy to interact with. We did the typical strip tour and he was helpful in directing us where to go to bypass lines and tourists. I had no idea how bad traffic on the strip was, we needed to add an hour to see everything which wasn't a problem. \n\nI didn't have time to research limo services before Vegas and just saw their ad in a magazine in our hotel. It was $85 an hour for a stretch limo."
"Roberto's is a Mexican fast food place that is sort of between a fast food place and a restaurant. They don't make bad food with my personal favorites being the carne asada fries, the carne asada chimichanga combination plate, the shrimp a'la diabla and their rolled taco. This place is down the street from my house so I do eat here a lot."
"I need to revisit my review for Espresso Royale. Maybe I've gotten a little softer during my time in Chambana, but it's growing on me, the baristas are friendly enough and the drinks aren't crazy expensive. $2.00 lattes on Wednesday are pretty nice too! Sometimes they try to make a heart in the foam, and that gets me every time.  If you can actually get a table here, you'll find that they are painted all whimsical like. Upgrade to 4 stars!"
"Classic\nKitchy\nSupper Club\nWisconsin.\n\nThat about says it all and I didn't even need to mention the food, but I will. I was presented with the most glorious 20 oz hunk of Ribeye I had ever seen. It was still sizzling on a hot aluminum plate that added much to the presentation and greatly to my enjoyment! Most have already mentioned the retro menu: Oysters Rockefeller, Shrimp Cocktail, Creamed Spinach... Wow. We ate there a week ago and my head is still spinning. Great service, great cocktails (Brandy Old Fashioned - sweet, of course) and an overall great experience. Everyone one in the room had full bellies and big smiles. I may have giggled for an hour after wards."
"I'm always on the look-out for good Pad Thai, and I'd driven by Ocha for months and still not given them a try... until last night.  And it was fabulous.  Not too sweet, not too hot (but with hot sauce on the side).  It was the best I've had in Las Vegas, with huge portions and not expensive.  A definite repeat for me."
"Can never go wrong going here. It's hard finding a barbershop you trust, and if you're need of a new barbershop this is definitely worth your time. I always get my cut from Frank, also great for a straight razor shave."
"It's a Home Depot, the staff is generally pretty helpful. At times, finding someone to help you can take some time. \n\nThe last couple trips went pretty well, and the staff was very helpful and guided us in the right direction for the toilet and sink repair parts we needed."
Whenever I go to Vegas... This place is as must for me!! I love their beef jerky and sticky rice!!!! So the 5 stars is only for that. If I start reviewing the other entrees.... Stars will be less :( Anywhos the beef jerky is the bomb!!! If you'r e hungry find another place... But for late late night snack and something light...order their jerky and their humongous to-go cup thai ice tea ;)
"In the 'Burgh for Thanksgiving and had to stop in for coffee.  Met Johnny, a local character, that has called the Beehive home for many, many years.  Heard through the grapevine that there is a bar in the works and then the coffee shop will return to it's original smallish 1 room setup ( Beehive now occupies 3 storefronts connected internally )."
"I've been taking my dog here since we got him, so he's been here for check-ups, shots, health issues, and to be neutered.  Every time I've been the vets were great.  I think we've seen all of them and they're all wonderful with my dog and know what they're doing."
"What an amazing view! They can serve me turds on a plate and would still give it 5 stars base soley on the view!\n\nThe prices aren't cheap, but not over expensive either. They could charge much more based on location in my book.\n\nThe steaks are awesome, and the salads are super yum!  I would say it's a great date spot!"
"All the reviews for this place are for the hot food.  Which is fine.\n\nWhat you need to know is that the meat counter serves up some of the highest quality meat you'll find.  \n\nWe will not leave LV without getting a couple of pounds of the house smoked bacon, and some bones for the dog.\n\nThe beef is great too.  We had some Ranchera style meat that grilled like a dream.\n\nGet some BBQ, but don't miss the goods on the other side."
"Stopped by here after a late night of casino hopping. I wouldnt say it's the best chinese food ever, but it did the job especially for late night. Plus that it opens til 3am."
"Jodi was great in helping us to get a superior look for our wedding while working with us to keep the price from being outlandish!\n\nWe met with 4 floral vendors total and Jodi stood out from the rest in everyway.  The other vendors were at least 30% over our rather large budget and didn't seem interested in working with us to find the right solutions.  Jodi was patient, consultative, and worked with us to give us what we wanted at the price we needed. However, Jodi's experience is equally as high end as any of the vendors with which we met.\n\nFrom my viewpoint, Jodi provides a luxury experience while also making sure to work with your budget... recommended on all fronts!"
"Sow's Ear is a fun place to come for knitting supplies.  Their hours are a bit inconvenient for me, since they close at like 6pm for a coffee shop.  It's because they regularly run knitting classes in the evenings.  Occasionally they have their late night knitting on Fridays where they're open until 11pm, and usually that's when I manage to make it out to Verona from Madison.  \n\nThe place is quite charming.  There are plenty of little niches throughout the place to hide away and knit for a while.  The walls and shelves of yarn and other knitting supplies are inspirational in their colors and fiber.  There are also patterns for sale.  The staff is knowledgeable about the many different kinds of yarn as well.  This is a great place for a knitter in Madison to check out."
"I called to have a car pick my boyfriend up from the airport as a surprise.  The lady I talked to was really nice and got it taken care of fast.  They also will keep track of your flight info, so if its delayed you won't have to call and update them.  The cars were clean, driver was on time and awesome.  Ask for Wesley he is hilarious and his baby is the Chrysler 300 stretch - its so pretty.\n\nI would use them again."
It has been a while and the menu we enjoyed ecapes me. The ambiance \nis pretty standard of spring mountain area. The one thing that should stick out to the Yelp community is the SICK and I ain't kidding wine list. Joyful house is a regular stop for Hong Kong whales late night. They evidently \ncan't get enough vintage Bordeaux. There were 61's 82's 90's and a plethora of other rediculous vitages and other fun Germans as well. I am not convinced that most of the wine list paires with the food style but damn it is sexy reading.
"I could probably spend a solid 8 hours in this place.  They literally have everything your imagination could think of I think.  And if they don't have the whole costume, they have all the supplies to make the one you want happen.  My only visit just came about last week and of course it's near Halloween so the place was decked out with decorations of robotic scary zombies and the like.  They have your standard costumes (pirate, etc.) and then some of the classic horror movie characters from some favorites like Friday the 13th, Saw, etc. I love horror movies so I was like a kid in a candy store quite frankly.  \n\nOne thing I didn't realize is they actually rent tuxedos too!"
"Awesome Spot. I was in town for Spring Training and happened by this place. don't ask me what I was doing in this part of town, I plead the fifth!"
"""Ok, not the cleanest place ever but it is Phoenix. Still, lots of party supplies, costumes and the quirky unexpected things that you can't find anywhere else. Pretty organized inside. They have areas arranged by them so it makes stuff easy to find. I went there for a Mardi Gras party and they had plenty of decorations, beads etc. I have found noisemakers for NYE and even novelty items. The staff is helpful when you are looking for something specific. They seem to enjoy the fun atmosphere and are friendly. It's a big place and it's been there a long time! I guess if you need to find \""""fun\"""" stuff, you know where to go!"""
"good food  afortable prices, but service was a lil' Disorganized. \noverall is a good place for dinner..!"
"Bill and his staff are of last truly dedicated customer service professionals that I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. They are HONEST, Hard Working and really care about delivering the best service possible. After dealing with them for years they are the best and most importantly, I can trust them. In this day and age thats hard to come by!"
"Luv Its has been around the valley for 30+ years. You dont stay in business with a bad product thats for sure... and Luv Its has mastered the custard game !!!\n\nIts smooth, it's thick, it's creamy... everything I want and NEED in a custard. In addition to that they have some very wonderful creations such as my personal favorite, the banana split. You get a whole banana with strawberrys, peanuts and just for fun they add in marshmallow fluff... \nThats personally what I call love !! \n\nI've been coming here for years and will continue to come many more.. I Love It.."
Real people go here.  The more you go the better it gets.\n\nUpstairs is as cool as a treehouse.
"Bike World is the place to go if your bike needs any type of repair. I do all of my own small maintenance, but for any big job or tune-up these guys are the best. I've been using Bike World for about 15 years and have always been completely satisfied with their work and prices. \n\n  I have never had occasion to purchase a bike from Bike World, but have bought many accessories over the years. The store is always well stocked with both things that you need and accessories you want. Every type of bike is represented here from road bikes to beach cruisers, mtn. bikes to kid's bikes. And like their service prices, the parts prices are always reasonable."
Houlihan's has turned around quite a bit.  I like the appetizers and the (over priced) drinks.
"Though Gamestops are aplenty in Charlotte, this location did a great job. I came in to sell an old Xbox that I wasn't using anymore. The manager was fantastic to work with. He busted out everything, tested it and gave me all of the trade-in value on one simple card. I was shocked! I didn't remember this being such an easy exchange. So happy to be in and out in about 10 minutes! He wasn't pushy at all. Very cordial and wanted to know more about my interests and not going straight for the sales jugular. \n\nNot much of a gamer, but this place is a Mecca for all things gaming. Not only can you find everything you need from systems, games and all of the necessary hardware, but these carry other gadgetry now as well. Apparently, they started buying and selling iPods and only iPhones, too! Pretty snazzy. \n\nIf I have any video game needs, though not likely, or need to pick up a video game/present for 10 year old's birthday, this is the first place I'm heading. Cheers!"
"I was skeptical to order at due to the other reviews. I was impressed with the delivery speed and accuracy. The driver was very friendly. The pizza was very hot and tasty. Overall, a very good experience. I will definitely be ordering from this papa johns again. Maybe they are turning things around?"
"Outside is run down and old. I like the classic look.\nInside in 1 big room. There is 1 Hibachi grill behind the counter where you can watch the chef.\nThe service is fast.\nFood is okay, not the highest quality but still good."
"Get nuzzled by a penguin.\nThis is the place you can go if you want to take pictures of a penguin and potentially get nuzzled by a penguin. I don't really think I need to say much more than this but I will because I like typing and I already have the Yelp window open.\n\nYeah, the penguin experience is 30 bucks on top of the regular admission (averages out to a dollar a minute to hang out with a penguin) but it is a nice, quirky thing to do. You'll get some cute photos out of it and gain a better understanding of these silly creatures. I do recommend it.\n\nThe rest of the aviary is nice. It's a bit small and you can probably run through the whole thing in about a half hour if you don't stop too long for photos. They have some bald eagles and exotic birds. The staff is very friendly and passionate about avian life."
"Where the west was won. \nAlso, a patio worth pondering.\nPrices are steep but service is solid. \nAnd the ambiance is interesting. Older crowds. Grandparents. But enjoyable for this gkjsnclforktnsndijrbethirty something."
"Neighbor stopped by and asked me if i wanted a gyro from this new place down the street, said sure. I am a loyal Salim's on Centre Ave. But gave it a try. All I have to say was.. delish. The cucumber dressing was different, not a cool taste, but a more of a zing. Wasn't overrun by the lettuce, but the actual meat. Havent personally been in there, but will be going to see whwt other surprises they have."
"This Alberstons is the place we stop when we need to make a quick run to the grocery.  It's super convenient for us.  The produce and fruit is usually fresh & you can actually get fresh fish, unlike most markets where you can only get frozen.  \n\nThe employees are pretty friendly and always ask if I need help with anything.  Prices at Albertsons are usually a bit higher than other grocery stores but they do accept coupons, which helps.  They stopped using the store rewards card a few months ago so prices are 'what you see is what you get.'  We typically do our grocery shopping at Whole Foods but will stop here if we aren't close to one.  They have a lot of organic options, even if they are a bit higher priced.  We always end up getting a loaf of the fresh bread when we walk by & smell it.  We are total suckers for hot, freshly baked bread!"
"I have been using them for a few years now, and aside from their odd location, they are my favorite in Pittsburgh.  When you bring clothing to them it comes back quick and clean, and does not cost an arm and leg.  They earned my service when my fiance brought in a winter jacket that had accumulated some bad stains, they said they tried to clean it and just couldn't get everything out so there was no charge.  How many other companies would do that?"
"I've been here twice in the last three years and thoroughly enjoyed each time.  The park is clean and well kept, it's not too crowded and the staff is friendly.  The rides are fun, especially the steep speed slides.  I also enjoyed the lazy river.  The wave pool leaves a lot to be desired, for me, because I couldn't ride the waves; although it was popular with a lot of other people.\nThe only drawbacks are that the ground is extremely hot during the summer, so be sure and bring some water shoes, or take your chances and leave your flip flops at the bottom of the slide.  The only other drawback is the price, it's $26 for each adult and that doesn't include $7 to rent a locker and the expensive food."
"""Where else can you go for a buffet that tastes better than Todai and pay half the price?  Well, go to Buffet @ Asia.  I found out about this place when we were at a friend's house in Henderson.  \n\nI feel their selection is just as good, if not better than most buffets.  They have a good selection of food.  Sushi, crab legs, sauteed lobster, mongolian bbq, an assortment of foods from different areas of Asia, and a good dessert bar with a chocolate fountain.  Whenever we go there, we spend hours getting fat.  If you go with me, maybe you can watch the \""""Bottomless Pit Experience\"""" where my friend eats as many plates as he can.  Trust me, you'll love it here."""
"I don't know how you can't go wrong. Stromboli was great, fast service, lots of beers."
This place is amazing! The donuts are sooo good and they even have fat free chocolate milk. The only downfall is their donut selection can be a bit sparse at times which is disappointing. \n\nTry the Bavarian cream donuts!!
"I've been a fan of this place for quite a while now. This is THE place for bubble tea.  No comparison. I always come here for their famous chunk chicken or their fried chicken cutlet. Rose tea offers quick service BUT they tend to squeeze customers into their tiny spaces. If you're unlucky enough, you get seated in the hallway right next to their bathroom entrance and the kitchen. I just wish they would extend their place just a little bit..."
"I ordered once for takeout and once for delivery from Grub Hub. Food is consistently pretty good. The veggie rolls are huge and fantastic (best part of the meal, by far). I could eat a whole plate of them alone. General Tso's chicken is great. The Cantonese Style Tomato Chili Chicken was not at all what I thought it would be, but it wasn't bad. Delivery takes forever through Grub Hub, and the restaurant forgot one of our veggie rolls, which Grub Hub reimbursed. Those are my only complaints. We will probably order again."
"This is by far the best pizza place in CU approved by my Italian spouse. They have the nice crust and pretty good quality authetic topics (cheeses and so on). \nIf horrific deep dish American pizza is your thing, don't bother going here."
"This place is definitely underrated.  It's like finding a girl who is a solid 7 in appearance, but once you get to know her, she immediately earns 2 more points.   \n\nIt's extremely affordable, small, cozy setting, with waitress's who are sweet as a madame at a massage parlor (so i have been told by my friend who i go with)  \n\nThumbs up to the squid salad, papaya salad, all the curries, and pad thai.\n\nHonestly, you can't go wrong with any choice here ---  \n\nTip - Be sure to use the head (that would be the restroom) where you'll walk through the pristine kitchen.  I like to hit up Good Will afterwards to look for cd's and other kitchen gear :0"
"Discovered this place recently by mistake.  OMG.  It's so darn good.  They make a veal parmagiana sub.  That's so old school!  The thing is stuffed with lightly breaded veal, a hunk of mozzarella, and oozing sweet garlic tomato sauce.  I'm addicted to my veal parm sub and a plain cheese slice.  The plain slice is all you need to give everything else on the menu a try.  So delicious.  I need to stay away from this place or I'll be huge in no time.  Nice people work there too."
"""It is hard to believe I have not reviewed Tony Franks.   I do not go there often but I do enjoy the place.\n\nLets put it this way...Tony Franks is a bar located in a house that serves great food and unbelievable burgers and have been since before dirt was invented.\n\nThe staff is generally always friendly and great (you may catch an occasional off day where the regular staff is not here and the backups just do not cut the mustard) and the small \""""cheers\"""" feel is awesome.   What a great place to chill, have a beer, and eat some food.  Oh yeah, the owner is not the most friendly in the world (at least the one time I met him)\n\nNow onto the burgers!  You cannot find a better burger in Madison at all.  Not even close!   They are made on a flat-top right in front of you and the taste is just wonderful.  If I did not have to watch my weight I would eat there all the time.   Check it out and do not forget to add the bacon to the burger!"""
"Taipei Express, if anyone isn't aware, is owned by the same family that owns Taipei South down on Park Road as well as House of Taipei in Huntersville. This is also the same family that got their start as the Great Wall of China over in the University area until they changed their name. To make a long story short, my family has been frequenting these restaurants ever since I was 8 years old. To this day, I have NEVER found a chinese restaurant that makes a better Sacha Chicken or Egg Roll. \n\nI love the Taipei restaurants. I love them!"
"""Good authentic Cantonese/mandarin food. The fish fillet was decent and had the \""""right\"""" flavor. I found the fried rice to be not fully mixed as it was just a \""""pack\"""" of rice\"""" that was not combined with the other ingredients. The restaurant was clean and the waiters were helpful. They also have a discount on food from 10PM-2AM which is nice if you want some late night Chinese food. Overall, KJ Kitchen is a place to check it if you are craving some Asian food in Vegas."""
"Dr. Fife is my go-to guy for all my root canals.  He's gentle, caring, and efficient.  He is also great at following up with his patients to see how they feel.  I am never sore or swollen after any work done with him, and he's always available for emergencies.  Great guy, great office staff, and great service."
"Honestly, the Yelps were all over the place so I wasn't sure what to expect - but we LOVED this theater!\n\nSaw Train last night and it was fantastic. I normally don't go to concerts because the artists are usually so far away and the acoustics so bad that you may as well watch from home....but it's Train...so worth the risk.\n\nOk, in all fairness, we had seats in VIP Box 3, so the view, acoustics and seats were perfect. Some Yelpers noted small seats (one obnoxious Yelper even said large people should stay away)...not true...space was fine.\n\nHOWEVER, if you go, get VIP Box (3-6 best) Row 4 Seats 1 and 2....Row 4 is important because this row has pull-out seats and tons of space to dance and standup with no one getting upset behind you...literally felt like our own personal Train concert...AMAZING!\n\nAnd is anyone really surprised that the drinks are expensive? Come on...it's a theater...drinks are always more...$10 beers at DBacks games people. Vodka soda talls with 3 Olives Vodka were $8...not bad in my book.\n\nWe will be back!"
Pizza is awsome here..... I usually get jalapenos and sausage on my pizza... the wings are a little dry
"Interesting hotel.  The lobby looks dated, but elegant at the same time.  The breakfast is decent, not great, but it is free and served in an interesting bar area room.  The patio is nice.  The room was clean.  Somethings were dated, but still looked good.  Need more power outlets.  The television was hard to figure out.  The two closets were nice, one in the hall and one in the bathroom.  I liked how close it was to the street with all the shops, restaurants and shops.  The heroin addicts on the sidewalk walking there was somewhat interesting and maybe a little disturbing.  I would stay here again though.  Good location, solid air conditioning and close to eats and stuff to do."
"What a great helpful and friendly place!!!!\nI came in one day for a smog check (which cost less than $20, WAY LESS THAN THE $67 it costs in Los Angeles!) and Jim helped me out. He told me to come back when I was registering my car, and he would take off my plates and put on the new ones after I got them. Well, I came back, and he did all that and checked the oil and water in my car too. \nAll for that initial price of almost $16. I will totally come back here when my car shits the bed. :D"
"Every time I go to Verona for training, I just go to this restaurant to have dinner, no surprises, authentic enough. you can't expect much in that part of the country. For an Asian like me, they are good, good noodles and good rices,  good rolls."
"When I first moved to Vegas I searched high and low for the best taco in the valley. After many disappointing meals, I found  Pepe's Tacos. Its located in a shady strip mall with that just looks that way... you'll be fine.  its open 24/7 and perfect for late night munchies.  I always went with the carne asada tacos and el pastor tacos.  The  thing that set this place apart for me that the quality of the food is always consistent. The asada tasted awesome every time I've had it. Cant remember ever having any kind of negativity experience at Pepe's ."
"Good breakfast and brunch, mediocre dinner and apps.  Avoid the Pamela's breakfast crowd and walk across the street to Murray Ave. grill.  Their breakfast lineup is solid, and as long as you aren't looking for the famed Pamela's pancakes, your breakfast needs will be satisfied."
"To supplement another reviewer's review who hasn't tried the falafel here... I have tried it and it's wonderful. I do ask for extra sauce though, which I recommend in case you find yourself with falafel-desert-mouth (those things can be dry!!!) The baklava is awesome and inexpensive. There is little seating inside this tiny gem of a find, so I'd bet on take out if you're going at lunchtime. And to make it even easier, call ahead."
"I've had some great tea and food from Tea Station. The Rose Milk Tea w/ Boba is a must as is the Strawberry Jelly Ice. I'd also recommend the Sweet Butter Toast for a snack. The stuff is legitimately some of the best you'll have.\n\nNow I have to explain why I take a star off. The staff is kind but they take a very long time to serve you. Perhaps it's a cultural thing that I am ignorant of, but the staff prioritizes everything over the dine-in patrons. You're better off ordering to-go and sitting down in the restaurant. \n\nOverall 3 1/2 stars. I am a repeat customer here, so it's worth visiting."
"Don't be put off by the appearance.\nThe great little cash only restaurant has some of the best beans, rice and salsa I have had (I know that many will refute this).\nThe menu is what you would expect, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. all at a great price, as well as lunch and dinner specials that can't be beat.\nThere is only outside seating, on a make-shift patio.\nThere is the occasional loiterer who will ask for change or food, so it is best for take-out and to-go orders. But eating there is not bad.\nIt is right around the corner from me and part of my neighborhood. There are always people there, and having eaten there often, I know why. My only complaint is they are cash only."
Great breakfast joint that reminds me of waffle-house. Do not order anything that could be stored in the fridge as it tastes like it have ( huevos ranchos ). Massive omlettes that are worth the price.
"You can't beat their lunch specials! $5.00 for a large portion and as always everything I have had here is very good. I personally like their Pad Thai chicken.  About the only complaint I have is their lack of consistency in heat. Some times. 10's a 10, and sometimes it's a 5."
My favorite pizza ever.  I enjoy their deep dish better than any Chicago pizza including Giordano's and Lou Malnati's.  I am originally from the Champaign area so when I go home to visit the family this is what I crave.    The owners are nice but there workers are sometimes incompetent and sometimes they'll mess up your pizza.  One time I ordered for pick-up and when I came to pick it up 45 minutes later they told me they were out of sausage.  Kind of peeved that they couldn't have called me to tell me so I didn't have to wait another 30 minutes.
what beats friendly gas attendants PLUS mcdonald's? nothing! gas + food in the desolate southwest Las Vegas area before hitting the freeway and easy access down blue diamond road.
It's a 50 year old dive bar. I have to say for being that old it's pretty clean. If your looking for somewhere downtown to have a drink go check it out. I thought it was closed when we 1st got there so don't be fooled. The bartenders been there 30 years. You can shoot pool for free.
"""On man. BEST. PANCAKES. EVER. This has turned into a Sunday morning tradition. The service has always been really great (with one exception, but maybe he was having an off day). Everyone is usually really friendly and attentive. The Cake and Egger is my breakfast choice but I bet it's all good. I've only eaten lunch here once. I got the salad bar and the black bean burger. The black bean burger while not terrible, just wasn't for me. It was really bloated and mushy which made it difficult to eat. I had to just eat it with a fork. I'm used to something a little more dense and solid like a burger would be. The salad bar was delicious. REALLY great selection and everything was fresh. My one complaint would be that I'm 5 ft 6in, which is not really that short, and it was really difficult to reach toppings and their \""""sneeze guard/window\"""" apparatus is really awkward. But it's worth the hassle. You go up and get your salad, they weigh it and you give the ticket to the sever. I got a very large salad for about $5.  Love this place. Great ambience, great food."""
"I took my sister-in-law and mother-in-law here while visitng over Thanksgiving to introduce them to English tea and it was the closest one near Oshkosh.\n\nNot a lot of seating but they have some a couple cozy coffee table-style seating options instead of just regular tables. A wide variety of tea but not a lot of menu selection options regarding the tea and sandwich combos, just basically the high tea and then you can mixer match sandwhiches which scones and whatnot.\n\nThe jam for the scones was superb and the scenes themselves were pretty good. The sandwhiches were a good variety but nothing really stood out.\n\nA large knick-knack/collection item gift shop of mosty Scandanian items along with tea accessories."
"LOVED IT! I love Le Thai, but seen the reviews and decided to give it a try! We got the Panang curry and combination fried rice. I'm pretty picky with Thai food because not every Thai restaurant is good. I've actually went to one that was down right gross and literally made me sick. I was off Thai food for a while until my friend had me go to Le Thai and reminded me as why I loved it. this place is pretty much as good as Le Thai but I do feel like I get more food at Le Thai. Next time I go I'm going to have to see but I'm pretty sure I do. None the less this place was good. I just wish it was a little bigger servings. (Maybe I just eat too much lol)"
"always friendly,,,, wait is minimal is at all,, and stop in at ryans also"
"I have been using these guys for 7 years and they are the best!  What does peace of mind run these days?  If you want honest answers and peace of mind with your vehicles, they give it to you and at a fair price.  Knowing that its done right the first time is my peace of mind!  I would recomend them to everyone!"
Uncle Sams is awesome. See my review of the Squirrel Hill location here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/uncle-sams-submarines-pittsburgh-2#hrid:0awQicUktjE9OTtI5GTkPQ\n\nThis one is not quite a good as it's brother in Squirrel Hill.  Mainly because it is a bit more run down and no waffle fries.
"You don't go here for the food, you go for the huge amount of televisions and variety in drinks.\n\nThis is one of the few bars where my boyfriend, who can't eat gluten or wheat, can get an awesome bottled beer (Bard's Tale, a sorgum stout).  You can also find a wide variety of taps, liquors and they have many specials.\n\nLots of good places to sit, this is where I would go for big games, like the superbowl or FIFA world cup.  However, the food isn't great.  HOWEVER, compared to other places with bar food and such, it's a very good price.  At buffalo wild wings, the wings are much better but almost twice the price.  You get ten wings at state street brats for $6, which isn't bad.  Burgers are okay, probably the best thing on the menu are the cheese curds or waffle fries (but they're not called waffle fries).\n\nAnyways, don't come real hungry. :)"
"Calfo's has been my mechanic for several years now and I absolutely trust them! They are honest, caring people and very knowledgeable about the work that they do! Every time I take my car in to them, they explain what needs to be done, and they fix it for less than anywhere else would. (I know because I've been to many other shops and also called around for price quotes!) I will never take my car anywhere else. Calfo's really is the best!"
"This is not your high priced luxury hotel. But you get more than your money's worth!  Damsal was very welcoming. Dominic was a great teacher and also welcoming. We got an upgrade, thank you very much!  Being disabled, it's helpful to get the grab bars in the tub. Little things go a long way. I would recommend to ask for a back room. We got a front room and the road is nearby. Not the hotel's fault. Just the way it is. If traffic sounds make you feel at home, go for a front room. They served Margueritas at 5 today. Lovely. I met up with my sister and had a very nice time. Do not let Angela, I think her name was, give you directions. She sent us the wrong way!  Dominic had been very helpful printing out directions to the restaurant we had originally chosen. We changed our minds and stopped to get new directions. Not good to be given wrong directions. The rest of the experience was fantastic."
"""Ah the i-pod and the MP3 player!  You can take hundreds of songs with you everywhere!  And they're so convenient too!  Never again will you be bored by the drudgery of\n\n--Listening to a WHOLE album's worth of music.\n--Having to go to a record store alone or with your friends.\n--Discovering an artist you never heard of.\n--Being overjoyed at finding that old, rare, obscure album or hard-to-find import.\n--Having something you can call yours and actually hold in your hands.\n--Building up a music collection that you can proudly display.\n--Finding out about an in-store performance or autograph signing.\n\nMe, I'll take the inconvenience any day.

A true haircut....well worth the price {$14}. Father and son are both personable and take the time to make sure you get the cut you want.
Great Starbucks located in the South Park Harris Teeter! Staff is friendly and fast! I go here almost every day and they've messed up my order only twice and fixed it and gave a coupon for a free one the next time!
"Everytime I visit this Starbucks, I always get my work done! That deserves 3 stars right off the bat. They have the typical selections of any Starbucks, so no surprise there. I do believe their seating and open space is superior to others in the city. The hours are okay, but I certainly wish they were extended a little. The crowd does fluctuate depending on what time of day and what day of week you attend. The baristas are quite polite and do their best to make sure no one is left waiting for their order longer than they should have to. I have no complaints about this Starbucks except for the dreadful parking situation. Be sure to park where it clearly says Starbuck's Parking. Anywhere else could result in your car being removed. I witnessed this happen to a person parked one spot over from a Starbucks parking space, and it was unfortunate."
"This is a Charlotte classic.  Only order off the right side of the menu, as the left side is for those who are clearly lost... Burgers, Fries, Hot Dogs, and beer. \n\nEnjoy the fact that bankers can rub elbows with bikers here, watch the game on that one tiny television, and marvel at the excellent operation these guys run.\n\nI love the waitresses and the food.  Once monthly maximum, otherwise, I'd have to run there and back to maintain my health."
"Not to be deterred by the new second floor location, finally reopened after the iconic street level restaurant was forced to close due to new student housing construction, I happily entered a world of culinary bliss, If there can be a more exquisite meal had anywhere up and down State Street, please let me know; otherwise, treat yourself right and set your taste buds free. Positively perfect cuisine in each and every way!"
"I love the pho gah here! Im giving 4 stars for 2 reasons. One, the service is usually slow. Nice but slow. Two, it's a little pricey. I ordered an appetizer and pho gah and it was $18. I would recommend this place though!"
"This is the second time i came here.  The server dressed in Kimono were courteous and friendly.  The environment was very traditional.  We arrived at about 6:30PM and the place was not busy.\n\nWe ordered a few rolls and dinner combos.  The crunchy tempura roll was very good.  the combo plates were ok but the portion could not be considered large, but adequate.  \n\nI asked if they served Katsu Don but instead of rice, i wanted Udon.  The server said that the chef was busy serving large party, and didnt have time to make special order.  i looked out from where our table was and saw a near-empty restaurant and wondered where the big party was!   The last time i came with a friend, he asked for something off the menu, and the same server gave the same lame excuse about serving a large party when the restuarant was also not busy at the time.\n\nOther than that, it was a pleasant experience and food was very good.  We will be back next time we are in Vegas again!"
My family and I have been coming here for more than 20 years. They have always taken excellent care of all the cats and dogs I have had over the years. Everything always seems to be completed in a timely manner. They are very reasonably priced and are not going to try to talk you into unnecessary tests or procedures. They are open on the weekends and have always squeezed us in for those unexpected emergencies. Both vets are very compassionate and truly care about their furry patients. I would recommend them to anyone in need of veterinary services.
Old School Vegas Gem with a little something for everyone.  Lots of prank gifts and little trinkets.  You could easily spend an hour browsing around in here.  I found huge oversized sunglasses to send my nephews for their snowmen in Michigan.  Lots of tins with different flavored mints.  Some of the adult gag gifts are great.  Lots of junk~\n\nThey lose a star for some of their ridiculous prices and no public restroom.\n\nIf you don't visit the talking parrot here you are truly missing out.  If you can't find the bird...ask an employee to show you to him. : ) Parrot doesn't disappoint!
"Friendly baristas, and the line usually moves pretty fast. Clean interior with plenty of spaces to sit alone or with a group. Nice cozy chairs positioned in front of the roaring fireplace during the winter. \n\nI'm ambivalent about Starbucks coffee, but since they have a loyalty program and they're everywhere, it's what I usually drink when I buy coffee."
"The dancing upstairs is pretty awesome if you are in college, if not I wouldn't recommend it.  Downstairs is a good place to chill for a drink or two, but idk about a whole night there."
"This place is the BEST in town! The guys here are honest and take the time to show and explain every detail. They noticed my cracked radiator while checking my brakes and gave me a great deal! The manager, Roger I believe, is a very wonderful man with a high standard of professionalism. The team is humorous and keep things lite. If you're looking for a spot to help with your car this is my #1 recommendation!"
I miss Panera. They had the best chocolate hazelnut bagels and good cheap coffee. And  free wifi. A grad student's wet dream.
"WOOHOOOO\n\nAfter a miserable flu week of tasteless food, a friend recommended How Lee, saying that the sichuan food will clear my congestion. As someone that loves any and all spicy foods, I was up for the challenge. As the many of the past reviewers wrote, YOU MUST ORDER FROM THE SICHUAN MENU! You will be greatly rewarded for doing so!\n\nThe chili pots put me in a flurry and by the end of a meal, clothes were shed and I was left panting...sure enough my congestion was gone. Delicious delicious delicious.\n\np.s. This isn't the How Lee from a few years back. New management really means muuuch much better food!"
"I go to Pamela's every time I visit Pittsburgh. I've only ever gotten the pancakes (with chocolate chips and bananas). Get those, you will not regret it. As for the other reviews and other food, I haven't experience it so I cannot comment on that. It is a small place and rather crowded so get there early before the Pitt students wake up. Yum!"
"Fun place to go if you need to get off state street for a while- hasn't been updated since the 50's and it shows. It's only a half block each off of the capitol square and state street. \n\nIt does get busy on weekends, so be ready for that. Shuffleboard and pitchers are the prime attraction. Can't be missed on a pub crawl."
I love this place. We ate here all the time when we lived in Arizona. Now I live in Cali and we do not have Fazoli's. If you have the time please check this place out! AWESOME!!
"Every time I've come here it's during my 30 minute lunch break.  They are so fast, it's almost why I default to them if I don't bring my lunch.  Their vegetarian sandwich is really good as well as their sandwich with roast beef.  I don't count calories but I do try to stay on top of how much sodium I consume; when I looked up the nutritional facts for their sandwiches, they were ridiculous.  Most of the sandwiches averaged 1200 calories.  It doesn't bother me, but I'm just sayin' for those people that are concerned.  It's also super cheap!  My favorite sandwich shop. :)"
"Being from the south and now living in Florida you rarely find a great sandwich.\nWell, look no further. The cheesesteak at Capriotti's is to die for. The melted cheese over the steak with the sweet peppers with onions and mushrooms....oh yeah you can't go wrong with the cheesesteak!\n\nThe Bobbie is also another sandwich that you must try. A turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce, mayo, cole slaw and Russian dressing.\n\nCapriotti's come to Florida, you will have a new following of loyal customers!\n\n5 Stars a must try.\n\nThere are numerous locations around Vegas so find the closest one to you."
"Came with my friend to get her dogs her shots. They're very very friendly and sweet to the animals. They have doggy treats to give them as well. Price for lab work goes to about $100 (not sure specifically for which) and her required doggy shots (he ones you need so you can get groomed and go to the park) come to about $70. \n\nThey weighted her and made sure they assured her dog that she's ok ad her dog was very fearful of being on the table, and up so high. To be honest, I admire their sense of empathy, hospitality, and comfort they bring to their patients as I wished regular doctors that treat us humans would be just as comforting and empathetic."
"Food court at Ghettrocenter.\n\nI don't know why it's so good, but it is. I'd put it up against any comparable restaurant (Samurai Sams, Kyoto Bowl, Panda Express, etc).\n\nI always order the 2-entree plate with fried rice, spicy chicken, and teriyaki chicken. Try it--you won't be sorry!"
"I decided to take a breather from my food to write a quick review. Seriously, the best huevos rancheros I've had since before my grandpa passed away. If I'm ever missing my grandpa's breakfasts, I'll just run down to this place. \n\nOkay, I'm going to go finish the second half of this amazing dish."
"I have never left Lolo's not beaming with joy.  I love fried chicken and I love waffles, though not as much as chicken.  I believe that Lo-Lo's not only has the best fried chicken in Phoenix, but the best waffles as well.  If you enjoy either, you must come here.  You can also buy a mason jar of red drank.  This is available nowhere else in the valley.  The macaroni and cheese is pretty good, but not my favorite style.  The real show stopper besides the chicken and waffles is the Red Velvet Cake.  Indulge.  Seriously.  But make sure you share.\n\nAlso, this is a bad place for first dates because it takes a really really remarkable person to tear your attention away from the food."
"Came here for dinner after a particularly disappointing steelers loss. Good service, nice atmosphere. I ordered the Havana burger, modeled after a Cuban sandwich. While my buddy ordered the pulled pork. Both sandwiches came with both regular and sweet potato fries, the sweet potato fries were excellent. We also split the buffalo chicken dip which was the highlight of the meal for me. Not much wrong with this joint. Burger was a little overcooked but not enough to ruin it. Will definitely be back at some point in the future."
If you need an Security System at your house or place of business this is the place to call.    Got all my equipment free.  Great installation. Great people.   You feel right at home.    \n\nThese are people you can definitely trust.      \n\nAnd best of all: you are being monitored by America's largest alarm company.    ADT.\n\nMy alarm went off and boy did they respond.   Too quick for me.  They got there before I did and I was down the street.
"Really great option for cantonese food in Oakland. I've never ordered from the buffet (it doesn't look too good), but they make an a-ok congee (no donuts, unfortunately), reasonably good roast duck & pork, and the fish maw soup is also very nice.\n\nIt's near my work and I like coming here for a late lunch when it's not crowded. The interior is kind of beat (drop-ceiling, battered furniture, etc), but I really like the laid-back atmosphere. \n\nThis is my favorite place for a secret 90-minute leisurely lunch on a weekday with friends and sharing a few dishes. Just arrive after 1pm!"
I'm not sure what else to say about this place that hasn't been already said. This place is LEGIT. Lines are long but goes fast. Chicken has always been fresh as can be when I go there.\n\nChicken is the best I have tried in the south so far.\n\nThe service was top notch also. The south for sure is very very nice and friendly and this place is no exception.\n\nThis is my place to eat again when coming back to NC.
"Great place. We needed a temporary day care and Traci was very helpful. Our two daughters loved it here. The older one was upset we didn't take her there earlier, they didn't want to leave. We were also able to watch them throughout the day, which was comforting."
"Very nice employee. Everyone in here were friendly and worked hard to get things right. i didn't have to try hard to get someones attention and there help. went i when it was on sale. one pair, second pair half off. Then 30% of all track jackets. perfect!"
"Paisan's gets 3 stars for the food, plus one more for the atmosphere and the beer list.\n\nHearty Italian favorites, slightly on the bland side. The food is decent, nothing special but not bad either. If you feel like carbing out, get the spicy cheese bread -- just like Mom used to make it under the broiler. The texture of the pizzas is great (crust slightly crispy, toppings slightly juicy), but again, it's bland.\n\nThey have about 8 local brews on tap. Can't argue with that!\n\nGorgeous lakeside location with one swanky dining room that has a fireplace. Bar area has windows in the round. The main dining room has wood-paneled booths transferred here wholesale from the previous location -- that takes some effort. But the neon sign on the outside, on the side the faces the lake, has been broken for ages. What's up with that?"
"i LOVE sharp edge creekhouse!  we are there almost every friday after work, and we've never been let down.  We've had 1 or 2 minor things go wrong with an order, but it's not even worth mentioning because it's always immediately taken care of above and beyond expectation.  The food is I would say, just average, but we love going there because they have a great beer selection and we always feel so welcome and taken care of when we show up.  The staff is so friendly, and so knowledgable.. these people know their beer!  Their late night menu is decent.  They have a bunch of half price appetizers, and have a limited selection of full price items as well (it's basically the entire menu excluding soups and salads).  The prices are good and we always leave satisfied :)"
I ate here on the advice of a co-worker. The price was decent and the good was good. A bit smokey walking into the business as you pass by the outside grills. Overall a fair meal for a fair price.
"A Vegas classic for, oh maybe 100 years...or so it seems. I hadn't been here in quite a while but  it's still how I remember it - in a good way. It went away for a period of time, replace by a ridiculous bikini bar but thank the divey bar God that they brought the Sand Dollar back!\n\nGreat location, great bands (mostly blues and classic rock) they have open mic night so you can bring your shower voice in and give it a whirl on stage.\n\n$2 PBR drafts, yes it's low brow but I like it. They do have a great staff of friendly bartenders who keep you lubed up so go have fun, listen to some live music and enjoy a Vegas classic."
"When I lived in the university area I used to love this little mom and pop joint. The husband is the business manager, his wife cooks and runs the kitchen and their son generally works as the one server.\n\nI don't suggest going here if you don't have some time to spare, it can take a while to get the food out. However, they do orders to go and you can always call ahead.\n\nI've gotten a number of things here over the years and I definitely have my favorites. The menu runs the gambit of Greek and Persian dishes. However, my 'usual' is the saffron chicken with zakresh rice (with dried currants). I almost always get an extra side of tzatziki, which has the perfect level of tang to it. \n\nThe souvlaki, salads, kobideh and platter with dill rice and lima beans are excellent. As everyone else has said, decor is pretty stereotypical, but I find the place endearing and always feel welcome here."
"Pretty good food.  The orange chicken was a bit TOO sweet, but I am partially responsible for not asking for hot oil.  Egg rolls are fresh, and their pork fried rice is spot on.  Probably the best chinese joint in the east valley."
I've ended up here to end many a drunk nights out. The staff have always been friendly and I usually always get the same thing since I've had pretty much everything else. It's always been good here.
Stopped by last week with my fellow yelpers. I was a little late cause I heard the craps table calling me. I got the Sprinkle Special and it hit the spot!! It was my first time out here and it won't be my last.
I also think their poppyseed hamentaschen are to die for. Sometimes I'll make a detour on my walk home just so I can peak in their window to see if they have any day-old hamentaschen left. They're sold @ a discount and they make my freakin' day.
consistently the best seafood in town. great atmosphere & service. limited menu-very few choices outside of seafood. king crab is great. the bbq style is not real good though. dungeness is alot of work and snow just doesn't have enough meat. go with the alaskan king crab w/butter. awesome!!! a little pricy compared to other options in town but worth the $$$. steaks are cooked perfectly & seasoned well. veggies are always hot & crispy. the corn & potatos in the steampot are fabulous
Michiganders living in Vegas should all stop in and say hi...and have a beer. Karen is behind the bar and she's extremely attentive and makes good conversation.
"I just got a new muffler on my 2000 Honda Civic. Overall,  I had a good experience.  They were fast and friendly but I felt it was a little more expensive than the other reviewers lead you to think. I spent $312 on a new pipe and muffler which came with a 1 year warranty.  All around a pretty good deal at a reasonable price but not a crazy cheap deal by any means."
"Really good food.. \nThis place is a total hidden gem in Phoenix.. more like the real Chinese food you'd get in places like LA, SF and NYC.. not the typical AZ buffet crap..\n\nPrices a a bit high but the food is delicious.\nTheir hours are a bit strange and they often look closed even when they are open.. weird.\n\nMany times Ive been here I was the only person in the place, which I don't understand, the food is really good.. Esp like the Egg Foo Young\n\nThe portions are much smaller but the food quality is much higher.. If your used to eating at Panda Express or China Buffet you won't like this place.. \n\nBut if you grew up in Seattle, SF, LA or NYC you'll def appreciate The Prime. Its not as good as those places but its the best damn Chinese food Ive had in Arizona and Im wiling to pay for good food.\n\nIm a big fan of The Prime Chinese Restaurant..."
"After a bad experience at TGI Fridays, my boyfriend and I decided to check out more local restaurants to support local business as well as open up our taste buds to things other than chain restaurants. Having family in Mt. Washington, I pass it occasionally so it's always been a place I've wanted to try. This was our first stop...\n\nThe food was excellent and a great start to more of a finer dining experience. It's fancy, but not suit-and-tie fancy, so if you want to come in a nice pair of jeans and a dress shirt - you're good. The food was great! We ordered the Pasta Carmela and it was enough to take home. The garlic sauce was light yet satisfying and had a zing of spice which perfected the meal. We also were served garlic bread and a salad with a wonderful house dressing that reminded me of an Italian/Balsamic mix. Also note that the place is BYOB. Enough said... The place itself sort of crammed which was one of the only downfalls, but overall the experience was pleasant. Service is great, too. I definitely would like to come back and allow others to experience this gem."
"Clean and professional animal clinic- I'll admit it doesn't look like much from the outside, but they offer a great level of service. I live nearby and they were able to take me in first thing in the morning at a half hour's notice. We came in, filled out paperwork (you can find it on their website to speed up the process), and waited just a few minutes for an exam room to be available.\n\nThe doctor we worked with was Shayne Randall- pleasant, thorough, and gentle with my furry friend, I would work with her again. Front office staff are also polite, prompt, and understanding. Brought my cat in at 8AM and had him home with a diagnosis, medication, prescription food, and a follow up appointment, by 4:30PM.\n\nPricing was reasonable, but I would appreciate it if more of the charges were explained- was told the fees for urine testing (~$40) and x-rays ($100) but was not given the opportunity to decide whether my pet was given an injection (~$40) or what the general exam fee was ($50), on top of my other charges. Just a heads up that they do push the Hill's Prescription Diet pet food."
"I honestly can't figure out why this restaurant only has 3 stars. If you want an authentic Vegas dinner, this is your place. The atmosphere is old school Vegas and the steak is some of the best I've ever had. The service was friendly and quick. My friend is gluten-free and the hostess and wait staff were incredibly patient and accommodating while explaining her options. I had the filet mignon and tableside ceasar salad and highly recommend both!  I'm definitely going back the next time I'm in Vegas!"
"Thank you.  Thank you thank you thank you.  I'll let the other reviews talk about the cuisine.  I'm not well-enough versed in Nepalese to really get into it.  I will say this:  the textures, the flavors, the quality of ingredients.  Wonderful.  Simply wonderful.\n\nPlease do not think my review (and the rare 4 stars) is because I live in a gastronomic desert.  I do, I admit it.  But the food here is absolutely wonderful.  Not only that, but the size of the place, the hole-in-the-wall ambiance, and the cash-only policy allowed me to pretend, for half an hour, I was in New York City.\n\nYour mom says you should eat at Himal Chuli, and so do I."
They are quick! Always quick to get your order to you and quick to refill drinks. Love that the food here doesn't make you feel heavy and actually tastes healthy without skimping on flavor. Only drawback is some tables are conjoined to other patrons which can be slightly awkward. Nevertheless great place for pho!
Let's just say this... you're drinking beer in a church.  Doesn't get much better than that.  The Onion Soup was great as well as the Wild Boar BBQ Pizza.  Can't beat the prices either.
"Business dinner. I was buying. I was hoping Spago, or IL mulino, or La Cave, etc. And the big shot i was taking out was old school and demanded Golden Steer. I wanted to jump off my balcony at Cosmo.  Golden Steer @ the Sahara?? You serious? Oh yes he was.\n\nMan, what a unbelievable suprise. While a classic steakhouse setting, greeting and service were upscale and professional.  Our server Tom Kehoe really made the night for us with amazing recommendations: seafood platter, bone in 22oz RIBEYE, and 120$ Napa Cabern that blew us all away. And he was engaging,  authentic, friendly, and charming without being phony or overbearing. He was on top of everything, controlling the pace perfectly. We trusted him all night long and his kitchen delivered a hell of a meal and a great business dinner.\n\nSahara or not, This place and server are recommended."
"We went here for cocktails on a Thursday. Bar ambiance was awesome - old school decor, tunes, and drinks. Excellent. Back the following night for dinner ...bread top notch, glass of veggies -very good and unique...I tried the special filet ordered medium rare....I could not cut through it - I thought maybe too raw - sent back/ came back hotter but same bloody -tough cut....disappointing. I can't eat anything I can chew through. The salad - wedge - was excellent and HUGE. Sides were very good hash browns and mashed carrots compote. BF had walleye - excellent. Service was excellent - we were seated in a small room in between the dining room and bar which was fine with us - quiet and intimate..... Until a party of 10 college kids were seated next to us but we were done anyway. Overall very good - I was just unlucky with my filet.....:( \nAlso even though I didn't finish 1/2 of my steak we were both over full. Portions are very large."
"For first time chicken buyers, my husband and I were nervous. We went to this feed store and most of our fears were settled. The employees are super kind, friendly, and helpful!\n\nThey have everything in there, except animals. However, they have a bulletin board for neighbors to put info on selling stock. We were pleased to see that we could buy chicken feed and our dog food all in one place! They sell regular food and holistic/organic options. Bonus, if you live where deer come around, they have bags of corn. Yes, it's beginning to be like a petting zoo around my house.\n\nI found the store itself very well stocked and organized. In fact, it was really clean. I wish it was closer to where I live because I would make frequent stops for all my animal food needs. \n\nThe prices are good and a bit cheaper than I found from online carriers."
"They are right down the street from my house and when I had a check engine light come on they were able to repair everything the same day.  I could go on and give boring details, but it basically boils down to the fact that they are friendly and efficient!"
You have to order the carne asada burrito it's amazing. And they only take cash but there is an ATM inside in case you need it. My daughter was a little disturbed by the bleeding Jesus mural in the wall.
"Amazing cabeza tacos!\n\nCarne asada tacos on the salty side, but not too bad.\n\nSalsa is mediocre, should have been more thought about\n\nOverall, the best in town, [so far]"
"""I have to travel to Pittsburgh several times a year, and I always stay at this Residence Inn. Yes, it's a bit old and outdated compared to other Marriott properties I've stayed in, but it's very clean and perfectly fine for a long weekend. The staff is awesome -- I've never had a bad experience with anyone, and they are always willing to help in any way you need, whether it be something hotel-related (i.e. asking for extra towels, etc.) or needing directions to local attractions. The rooms are a good size and feature a nice kitchenette. Anytime I've stayed here, the bathrooms were clean as well. The only thing I really don't care for is their \""""business center\"""", which is one extremely slow, 90s-era computer and a printer. There is free wi-fi too, but it's slow.\n\nThe location is not bad. It's obviously close to UPMC, and it's not far at all from the University of Pittsburgh or any Oakland attractions. It's very easy to get to the rest of the city by car -- I haven't found that anything worth seeing is more than a 15 or 20 minute drive. I will definitely continue to stay here."""
"This restaurant is irreplaceable for me. I simply love it. There is no better place to go to treat yourself and a loved one (great for dates) after a long week.\nI am always blown away by the unique tastes, textures and gorgeous plating that L'Etoile has to offer. Also, anyone who walks in is treated like royalty (even if you showed up without your formal attire) \nI was totally taken by the experienced and professional wait staff and their wine connoisseur is just a pleasure to talk to. \nI would have given this 5+ starts, but I cannot lie, I just don't have the money to go to this restaurant as much as I'd like. It is not for the faint of heart or the sparse of pockets. I try to make it here for dinner at least once a year. But oh how I wish i could eat here more often. \nI always have a lovely time at L'Etoile and I'm very much looking forward to my next visit"
VEGAN donuts.  That taste DELICIOUS.  And cost ONE DOLLAR.  WTF else do you want? \n\nBest ones? Boston (soy) creme or the gigantico apple fritter.\n\nSo worth the trip to China town... get your vegan ass in a taxi and get a dozen to take back to the homeland. \n\nCASH ONLY!!!
"Are you kidding me?  A vegetarian dream in an odd Antique store?  Yep and fantastic prices and wonderful food to boot.  More than reasonable prices, portions and panache. Seriously, though, this hole in the wall is worth finding."
"For the period of time I wasn't a resident of the city and decided that I wanted to do a bar crawl on the South Side I opted to get a room here.  Best decision of my life at that point.\n\nParking is provided behind the hotel and only $14 extra.  Come and go as you please while you are there.  Three of us stayed in the room and with two beds and a pull out sofa it was a nice choice.  No sharing of beds for us.  \n\nWithin walking distance to everything on the South Side made it easy to basically leave everything but cash and ID in the room and venture out.  It was a party weekend in the Burgh so even after the bars closed there seemed to be an after party in the hotel itself.  \n\nPool and fitness center within the building with a restaurant on the ground floor.  So if you didn't want to go anywhere while there you didn't have to.  Great location too if you wanted to head downtown, just go across the 10th street bridge and you are basically in the downtown area."
"""We needed a place to eat before heading back on a Sunday morning coming down. All of the breakfast places in Squirrel Hill were at capacity. We walked down the street and stumbled into Rose Tea Cafe. The server was a friendly guy who was able to point us in the right direction. The chunk chicken that my buddy ordered was delicious. It was very similar to a Thai basil chicken dish but with chunked up chicken instead of ground up. I appreciate the word \""""chunk\"""" so that was an added bonus. It also made me think of the Houston, TX slang of \""""chunk up the deuce\"""" which means to throw a peace sign to somebody. I ordered a bone in pork chop over rice. It had a sweet BBQ-like sauce that was not bad. I was trying to keep my cost low at around $9 because there is a $15 credit card minimum."""
Their fruity tropical drinks are incredibly delicious!! Some are really boozey and others not so much. The patio out back is a lovely place to spend a summer evening (although the uneven ground makes for a wobbly experience at times - or maybe that was just the drinks). They don't take cards which is pretty unfortunate for a place in their price range.
"I had a pizza topped with pineapples and ham (Hawaiian is my favorite!)  Although it tasted great, I did not like that the cheese was somewhat greasy.\n\nThe service was excellent; could not have been better.  The restaurant was very clean and the architecture is gorgeous."
"I used to frequent Nova's on my way into work. I haven't been in quite awhile but I stopped this evening for a cup of Java. What made my quick stop even better was the gentleman working behind the counter. There was quite a line in front of me and he was patient, friendly and professional. When it was my turn I embarrassingly didn't have enough cash (who carries cash anymore?!) and didn't want to order other stuff just to meet their debit card minimum and also didn't want to purchase a gift card as I am moving out of Charlotte. He said not to worry, it was on him and told me to enjoy. Any other time I've been to Nova's in the morning the staff is always super friendly. Today topped all of my experiences there and I have to say that on top of the incredibly nice gesture, the coffee was perfectly brewed as usual. I will miss this awesome place when I move. Keep it up - the service, and yummy coffee."
"Knowledgeable, patient, eminently reasonable in all respects. What more could one ask for?"
"""I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered (coffee, tea, pastries, lemonade, smoothies) They have a lot to offer and you can get whatever flavor combination tickles your fancy. One day I was feeling adventurous and ordered a strawberry-coconut soy latte. The barista said \""""In 15 years I've never made that before\"""" It was amazing! \n\nThe only negative things I have to say about the 61c is that it can get very crowded and the tables are situated very close together to maximize seating ."""
"Not only the best mexican in Charlotte, but the most fun place to eat it.  Chicken Quesadilla is awesome (I have ordered it as both an appetizer and entree in the same meal before, it is that good), colorful waitstaff, good margaritas and large selection of mexican beer at a good price.  A few months ago they had a waiter that looked and acted like captain Jack Sparrow and somehow pulled it off (although he kept calling me darling).  No reservations, be prepared to wait (only downside).  Skip the queso.  Fish taco is also solid.  Make sure you don't go on a gallery crawl night or it will be a 2+ hour wait.  Also, the hostess here is typically rude and the times they give are meaningless (we were told over two hours and called within 15 minutes) - I wish they would just take reservations or get a decent hostess)"
"Gooski's is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh!\n\nWhy, oh why, would I enjoy such a small punk dive as Gooski's, you ask? For one, service is amazing, beer selection fantastic, shows there are great, they have the best jukebox in the city (maybe even in the state!?), and their prices are decent. Only setback - smoking's still allowed here, so I wind up having to shower immediately after every visit. (Not that I don't shower already after a sweaty night at a bar, but you know what I mean!)\n\nFor a (very) amateur beer connoisseur, their fridge sends me to heaven and back. They have a full supply of pretty much all the Unibroue beers, Delirium, Lambics, and a whole slew of other imported beers I've never even heard of. More importantly though, their usual weeknight bartender is amazing! To be honest, he looks to be an intimidating character, but in reality, he's super nice, patient, mad efficient, and helpful in selecting my next brew of choice. A+ for service!\n\nDefinitely check out Gooski's if you don't mind a bit of smoke and some Polish Hill punks."
"""Dr Cathleen Whitcraft and her vet tech Laura are an amazing team! I have to say I have been to quite a few vets in town, and I absolutely love this place! They give honest opinions and advice. Also, their compassion when it came \""""time\"""" for my Mia will never be forgotten. Unfortunately I'm moving out of Vegas, and I will miss them a lot."""
"""I love this place, mostly because it means I don't have to deal with the oversaturation of bars in the South Side.  The \""""squirrel cage\"""" as some affectionately call it really is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh because it's a little dive-y, but still hip, and has nice booths to sit in where you can just get a cheap pitcher or two and chill with your buds.  It's also great for people watching!"""
Go sit in bar for drinks. In the dining area you will get great or lousy service depending on server.  One of the best places to eat in the Whitehall area. Very good standard food chain.  Tables for groups is nice.
"As a Charlotte resident for a little over six years, this place has pretty much been a go-to throughout this time. I'm surprised that I haven't gotten around to write a review about Cabo until now.\n\nThe place is pretty loud especially during peak times (Friday and Saturday nights) but it has a fun and funky vibe. If you plan to go during peak times, be prepared to wait. However, the plus sides are that they text you when your table is ready and there are a number shops and bars to stop in while you wait.\n\nIn my recent visits, the waitstaff has been SUPER friendly and accommodating. You automatically start off with a small-ish bowl of corn salsa and chips. Personally, I recommend getting one of their signature margaritas. I usually stick with the skinny margarita. As for the tacos, I'm a fan of the BBQ mahi mahi tacos with rice and beans. The rice and beans aren't the greatest but a sufficient enough side choice for myself.\n\nIf you are a fan of fish tacos and a laid back time, Cabo is a good choice!"
"Strawberry Fields is bougie as hell, it's as if Trader Joes, Bristol Farms, and Whole Foods had a love child and put it in a tiny upscale store in the middle of nowhere.\n\nSo needless to say, I love it.\n\nI have fun browsing needlessly expensive organic chocolates, dried cranberries, or obscure imported rice products.  But what makes it better, is that this store actually carries Appletiser, my non-alcoholic beverage of choice from South Africa.  That's right, it's basically carbonated apple juice, but in a delicious, cold clear way that makes martinelli's weep with jealousy.  \n\nFor that, I will cheesily say that I love Strawberry Fields.  Forever."
"Blue Marlin is great for date night. I've tried most of the entrees, and my only complaint was that the seared tuna with quinnoa was a little too oily. The soup and all of the other entrees I've tried still make Blue Marlin worth 4 stars. Other reviewers have said that it's loud inside, but the outdoor seating is quiet, peaceful and perfect for summer in Madison."
"Yet again a very inexpensive and very friendly experience. We decided to stay again at the hostel and got a private room with a full-size bed that demanded that you rise by at least 8 am. Hey, you don't stay at a hostel to sleep without end or shag with comfort! No! It's cheap, friendly, safe and doesn't break the bank. Please note: Limited parking is extremely limited and the street parking directly in front is metered. Walk about 4-5 blocks West and the free parking is plentiful. Take your shoes off and stay a while!"
"I was hungry, and Judit was running late, so I ran across E Carson to try out the Real McCoy. What a fantastic little hole in the wall! If you're looking for good, cheap eats, come here. Half (at least 6in, seemed bigger) hoagies start at $3. Three dollars! I think the most expensive one was still less than $4. The menu is limited, but, really, how many sandwich options do you need? The lady running the joint is really sweet, and the whole place has a very home-cooked feel to it. I went with the polish ham and provolone and a side of potato salad, and it cost less than $5. Best part? It actually tasted good. Fresh bread, plenty of ham, sour pickles--yum!\n\nCash only, and take-out only. No tables or chairs to enjoy your cheap eats."
I have been using this vet for 15 years +.. The quality of service they offer is immeasurable.  They are personable and the staff is so accomidating.  There are no buts with them just great service. Honesty and integrity are never in question. This can be tricky with other vets because in this profession they know we love our animals.. I've heard horror stories and luckily don't have one to tell.. Dr. Wilson and Dr. V are both awesome! My doggies are always in good hands with them!
Pretty much your standard pet store. Two things I do like is that there's on-site grooming services available and they had plenty of stock of the Blue Mountain dog food I use. I usually went to Petco in CT and they were always out.
"this is the place to go if you've procrastinated on a costume. they have a ton of stuff and they rotate in seasonal things. the employees are eccentric and fun.  there are costumes for rent and to purchase.  the only thing is the costumes are a bit pricey (which is why I recommend it for procrastinators).  if you are able to plan ahead, you'd get a much better value shopping online."
"Very nice people running the place.  They aren't as busy as some of the more popular places in the area (Pho So 1, etc), but they serve great food at decent prices.\n\nAbout average on the cleanliness for an Asian place.\n\nHowever, their food is excellent.  Their Pho is great, I've had it a few times and it was excellent - all of their meats (steak/flank/chicken/etc) are good quality and their broth is great.\n\nIt's just not in a prime location to attract a lot of traffic, haven't been here in awhile, but planning to go back when I have time."
I went for a symposium here last weekend and I have to say that the campus is pretty snazzy. I go to grad school at CSUN and our campus is like a homeless person asleep in an alley way. Not so with UNLV! The place was really nice with allot of modern facilities. \nThe anthropology faculty and staff were incredibly knowledgeable and were really involved with outreach efforts.
"My parents have lived down the street from here since 1995. We used to go during the afternoon or early dinner, the menu is diverse and pretty much everything is good. I havent been here in over a decade until recently and I was very happy to see not much has changed. You can get breakfast at anytime, free drinks at the machines, amazing fried shit, in house brews (among others), friendly crowd and staff, lots of seating and pretty much a local spot. Beer wise I like the Leglifter or the Talliwagger personally."
"The entire staff are awesome! I think I know almost every single persons name that work there and vice versa.  \n\nI'll admit a few years ago I had a fall out due to an issue with a manager at this location.  But I'm glad that a year after that I happen to come in for a business emergency and found out that she no longer works there... So now I'm glad to say that I am back as a loyal, happy customer.  \n\nThey recently remodeled the place- so it looks more organized and updated.  They have bilingual staff - Japanese and Spanish people that can help you out with anything :P. This location gets high traffic due to all the businesses in their close proximity.  But definitely their professionalism and friendliness overrides waiting in line for a few minutes !!"
Mad Cat deserves more than 5 stars. I love giving my money to a local business that cares about animals and supports charity. This is the #1 reason why I refuse to go anywhere else. They sell food that is actually natural and good for your pet (like Orijen!) instead of the stuff that you find in big box pet stores. The prices are fair and my dog loves the little chews that are buy 3 get one free. The employees are also supah fantastic and they even have free samples of pet treats at times!
"If I were to buy a home in Las Vegas it would have to be around Rancho and Craig because it's next to two great establishments, The Draft House and Lee's Discount Liquor.    But then again I'm not sure my liver would stand for that.   \n\nLee's is awesome.   They have a great selection of beers, wines and spirits at very reasonable prices.    The staff has been friendly, but I've found it to be more fun to walk up and down the aisles to see what goodies they have for sale.    The last time I was there bought a Delirium Tremens and an Arrogant Bastard.    Mmmm mmmm...  good to find them both in the same spot.   \n\nWill I be back?  Of course I will."
By far the best place to take your car.  I drive  30 minutes to get there and pass many other car places but wouldn't go anywhere else.  Vic and Dean are as nice and honest as they get. They have serviced our cars for many years!
"I like the Mt. Lebanon location more, I think.  Sq Hill was always so busy.  I like the unique menu, good service, and I don't miss the naucious feeling that you sometimes get from some restaurants."
"Having not yet been to any of the bakeries in PIT, I have only Arizmendi and all those hippy slow foods California bakeries to compare it to.\nIt's a wonderful bakery to have nearby!  Being able to swing by and have fresh bread with dinner is amazing.  \nAll the loaves I have tried thus far are de-lish.  The only one I found a little lacking was the Left Coast sourdough.  It had the perfect texture, and its hard to argue with freshly baked, but the flavor wasn't nearly as tangy as I would have liked.\nI am excited to work  my way through the seasonal selections as the year goes on.\n\nBonus points for the well curated and well priced cheese selection.  If you are looking for something a little more special than what the GEagle offers but don't feel like making the trek to the Macaroni Company in the strip."
"As someone who works in SouthPark, I visit this Starbucks A LOT. And for the most part, it's your standard mall Starbucks. But the employees here really make the difference. They're all friendly and cheerful and they remember their regulars and their drinks. It's the only Starbucks I visit with any kind of regularity. It's that good."
"This place has every nut , bolt and screw you will ever need! staff is helpful and attentive!!!"
"I eat at this restaurant at least twice a week.\n\nThis is the best asian fast food restaurant in town.  I love everything that I order there.  I am picky and like to leave out certain vegetables or change the sauce or alter the spiciness.  I have been able to do so and pleased with the outcome every single time.  In the hundred or so times I have been to Taipei Express (no joke) I have never had a bad experience. \n\nI wish there was room for them to expand and build an addition, but there isn't.  Also, parking is hard to come by.  I always park in the next door lot, even though it says office parking only.  To date I've never been towed.  Also, little know secret, there is parking directly behind the building...but only about four extra spaces.  \n\nAll in all, I am in love with Taipei Express.  MMM!"
"Mainly a fan because I love Mediterranean food and they are so conveniently close to my house.  Beyond that they are kinda nice too!  But everytime I go I just know to get the hummus side because it is going to be dry, very dry food.  I get the chicken sharwarma and for some dry is not always bad and like I said the staff always treats me good and I am so thankful for their location.  Their bread is not the fluffy hand done pitas that I am use to so it is real thing and normally it may be hard on the outsides but the inside is nice a chewy-sometimes! Also for the price of a lunch under 7 bucks with salad, rice, torshi(sp?) is very good.  I personally just have to conjoin it all together with their awesome hummus to really make it a great Mediterranean experience!  Literally I still visit this place at least twice a week so it certainly is not bad to me by any means!"
"I remember The Beehive when it opened up in the mid 80's. I grew up on Southside and this place is kind of a historical now. When I come back into town I swing in there. Their espresso drinks are all pretty good and the food is ok. \nThe main reason to visit this place is the atmosphere. It is very urban and hip in nature, and has a lot of personality. Each of the 3 rooms has its own feel for sure, however the last room is a smoking room and if you are not a smoker you do not want to go in there....it is gross as hell. \nCheck it out for sure, as it is very Southside in feel."
"You cant go wrong with any flavor at Dave and Andys. Really the only place in Oakland to get homemade, fresh scooped ice cream. \nThe only problem students might run into, is that they only take cash, but the have an ATM inside."
"I'm still not sure if this should get 3 or 4 stars (I'd give it 3.5 if I could), but there really are many awesome things about Angelic. Normally I don't care for decor, but this place is really a great place to eat and drink. Speaking of which, yes, this place no longer brews beer on the premises. However, the brewer ended up starting another brewery in town (Ale Asylum), and Angelic has all of these beers, along with many other beers.  That's very good. \n\nThe thing that I wish Angelic would improve on is to broaden their appetizer menu; almost every appetizer they serve is made with cheese (which I don't eat), and of the items without cheese, almost all of them are rather expensive. So for me, I prefer to come here to drink rather than to eat. However, there are others who will, without a doubt, like the appetizers more than I do, so that's cool. If you think you will enjoy  it, super."
"As someone who was brought up on Turkish food, I was pretty impressed.  I had the Izmir kofte with lentil soup, both of which were great and authentic, but their yellow rice was unfamiliar to me.  My friend had the salmon special, which was also in an unfamiliar style, though he was apparently very pleased with it.  Lunch came out to about $20 for the two of us.\n\nThe service suffered a bit toward the end, particularly because they only had 2 wait staff for lunch, and they were clearly overworked."
"Wouldn't think about taking my girl anywhere else.\nScott the owner has been outstanding.  The staff love my girl and have even stayed open late just to accomodate my schedule so they can get to see her!!!\n\nAnd BTW they are no judgemental, and pitbull friendly.\nPuma's nailed have never looked better (perfectly grinded down and rounded (NOT HACKED WITH CLIPPERS).\n\nCan't say enough good things about these guys and gals.\nMediocre staff may come and go (it's a groomer not a doctor's office folks), but the owner cares alot and will always go out of his way for the dog b/c you can tell he's a huge dog lover and that's what makes the difference!"
"""Why did I wait so long to try this place?  Admittedly, the location doesn't jump out at you.  Portofino's is located in a strip mall off of Eastway Drive.  The interior is small, but lovingly decorated in the Italian style.  The music compliments the decor.  \nOur server was the nicest man!  He said, \"""" you look like a wine drinker,\"""" and offered me a sample of an Italian red that wasn't on the menu.  So good, and it was only $6.00!\nMy friend got the pasta fagoli soup, and a pasta dish featuring salmon.  I ordered the Gorgonzola tortellini minus the grilled chicken strips.  Our meals came with bread and salads, featuring some if the tastiest blue cheese dressing.  My plentiful dish was so good that I could have drunk the sauce if my manners were subpar.  My leftovers were boxed, and my husband will have a special lunch tomorrow.\nWhen we left, the entire staff said goodbye and thank you.  It is so rare to have everyone smile at you.  Southern hospitality Italian style!"""
"I ordered Pesaro's last week and it was great. I know a lot of other people have had bad experiences, but I really loved it. We got a large pizza with black olives and extra cheese. It was cooked perfectly, delicious and it got here in a reasonable amount of time with no problems. I'll try it again soon and hope that my opinion doesn't change!!"
"Nadine's is a place where the inverse property of food takes place. The smaller this place is, the better its sandwiches are. This is one rule that you definitely must keep in mind if you choose to step in.\n\nNow, I didn't get to eat in my first time, but I did get to eat well. I was privy to trying the French dip and the fried pastrami they have there, which are basically complete decks of meat, cole slaw, pickles, and rye put together. Pretty good. \n\nI definitely want to go back sometime."
"""Best Goodwill I visited in Charlotte area and let me explain why...\n\nThe Matthews Goodwill is in a relatively prosperous part of town (near Providence and McKee Rds) and then donations they receive outmatch what you find at other thrift stores.  It's not uncommon to find gently-used men's Gap, Banana Republic, and Brooks Brothers shirts and pants.  While other thrift shops have \""""vintage\""""-looking clothes (I'm using vintage euphemistically here), this Goodwill has clothes that pass for brand new.  \n\nAlso, the book selection is quite amazing.  They sell hardbacks for $1.40 and paperbacks for .99!  I've found some pristine books that may have been read once.  Even if the store is out the way for you, you'll save major $$$ by purchasing your books here rather than at Borders, B&N, or other new book retailers.  \n\nThe service is typically amiss for Goodwill-the cashiers are indifferent if not downright unprofessional.  The furniture is overpriced, so don't waste your time looking for a steal here.  Otherwise, this Goodwill is A-OK with me."""
"This place is a little slice of Detroit, minus the Robocops and crushing unemployment rates.  Their hot wings are really delicious, but be sure to ask for more hot sauce if you're going to get them delivered.   They can be sparing at giving that up.\n\nThe pizza itself is okay, nothing super special -- though when hungover, it does magic.  Combine with the wings and NFL playoffs to create a really fun environment when eating there!   PS:  If you put a little ranch and hot sauce on their Guys and Dolls pizza, you will increase the deliciousness 10x.  \n\nDefinitely try it out on sports nights!  PS:  Large is LARGE.  Huge. Feeds three people and leaves half leftover."
"""The only place that I go when im craving sushi!  Its not an all-you-can-eat place. The rolls are a good ratio of rice to fillings and the fish is delicate. This is a family owned place. I think most of the customers go back because the chefs are so friendly... Kinda of like the \""""Cheer's Bar\"""" of the sushi world."""
"He is an amazing pediatrician, very smart, has an MD and JD.  They have a very busy practice but he never makes you feel rushed.  He listens to concerns and gets along well with my would be doctor husband."
"Cats eating us  out of house and home!  We have three and some like the dry stuff and some like the can.  Not to mention the kitty litter!  We love em and Petsmart has what we want, so we stop in often. \n\nA quick trip to Micheal's next store reminded me I needed food for the little darlings, so at lunch, made it in without long lines.  A really good place to find a large selection of pet items!"
"I love McDermotts. I go to them for everything, and every time I've had them fix something, it stays fixed. I have a junky old car (13+ years), and they've kept it on the road for the last 2.5 years."
This IS the place to go for any shoe or leather repair. Luis has been a miracle worker... Puppy chewed the leather couch and he fixed it (three times) - countless  designer shoes have been refreshed- heels fixed- belts mended. He's a sweetheart and doesn't overcharge. God knows I love my shoes and I know I'm in good hands with Luis!!
"""Another in my multi-part Las Vegas saga of reviews. \n\nAlthough not legendary by any means, this buffet is a perfect cost to quality ratio. The after tax, before tip cost for lunch is around $17.00 including a beverage. The excellent sushi, crab legs and other seafood measure up.\n\nSome exotic things you may find are crispy fried frog legs (tell your friend they're chicken wings), crispy fried squid (was a little over-cooked, but still tasty if you stick with tentacles) and a menagerie of shelled seafood prepared in a number of ways.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of the items they offer are garbage, but they have just enough good items to allow you to satisfactorily bypass these items of questionable quality.\n\nOur server provided excellent service. Amusingly, although she had an otherwise thick accent, she could say \""""you're welcome\"""" with absolutely no accent at all!\n\nFor those wanting to avoid touristy buffets with inflated prices for the same quality, this is a great place to try."""
If it wasn't for yelp i would never knew that there is a Gurudwara Sahib in Las Vegas area. Beautiful Building and open to all regardless of gender and race. i uploaded few pictures i hope you guys like them.  This place is 20-25 minutes away from Las Vegas Strip. There is another Sikh Temple which is very close to the Las Vegas airport.
They have the best boba in town! There boba is always soft and plump and its soooooo good! I hate when you get boba that is like falling apart! Plus the place is adorable and the staff is super nice! The have a punch card and vip card that I religiously use! If your looking for a good boba place go here!
"Yes, this place is a little rough with lots of blue collar customers. Great beer specials and wonderful oysters on the half shell, only 35 cents each M- F from 5til 7 pm. Fresh seafood baskets of shrimp, fish scallops and sides.\nExcellent waitress, Ashley, very attentive to service. Other location in Matthews closed thank God, what a dump.....great place if you wanted a fight.\nSouth Blvd is good stuff"
"I came here per a recommendation from the hotel front desk/shuttle driver. The ice cream is rich and very smooth. Plus, a single scoop is enormous! The horchata flavor was decently rice-y and cinnamon-y. I would have liked there to be more rice flavor. I do regret not getting the zanzibar chocolate that everyone raves about. If I'm ever in Madison again..."
"""This place is definitely a dive, but in a charming family-run way, and they know what \""""vegan\"""" means (e.g. no fish sauce). The vegetables in my spicy red curry seemed fresh, and the dish was delicious. \n\nWhat else? They give you tons of rice. Water tasted a little funny, but I might just be used to Chicago's tapwater. To be safe, get a beer instead."""
"I can only speak for the ribs because I am on the low carb thing. I get mine with no sauce, they are the best ribs I have had in the charlotte area. \n   To get ribs  this good I was driving an hour away. \n   My daughter loves the chicken, beans, and fries. I can not say anything about the sauce because I have not tried it and when I do have sauce I always have it on the side, to many opinions on what makes a good sauce and I would not want the sauce to ruin a great rib. These ribs need no sauce anyway! \n I love BBQ ribs and I am very happy to find ones so good so close."
"The most complete collection that I've seen in a music store in a long time!  The only thing I didn't find was a separate Electronica section, but overall still a great place.  Multiple copies of albums that I hadn't seen before in any other store, old consoles and video games, and reasonable prices (maybe a touch above what you'd pay elsewhere).\n\nHigh points: Huge selection, responsive staff.\n\nLow points: No vinyl (that I could see.. maybe I wasn't looking hard enough).  Parking may be difficult in the evening, because it's in a popular location."
"I am not sure if this is the actual grocery or what, but I will review it as such.\n\nThis is a small bakery that has great breads and pastries.  They also have a small grocery with specialty items and some of their own sauces, spreads and oils.  Their produce is always fresh and fairly priced.  They even make their own large dog biscuits which sell for only $1.50 each.  My dogs definitely approve.\n\nOne Saturday afternoon I went in around 3pm and they had the loaves of bread buy one get one free.  I don't know if this happens in the late afternoon every weekend or if I just got lucky."
"I don't think I can emphasize enough how much easier (and just overall less stressful) of a time it is to come here on a mid-week weekday.   Service is better, food is better, drinks are quicker."
"I moved to Charlotte several months ago and needed a hair salon that can handle Asian hair and lucked out finding J&S. This shop is operated by several Malaysian ladies and the place is packed every time that I have been there. While most of the clientele is Asian, I do occasionally see others coming in for the great deal. Men's cut is only $13 and add a couple of bucks you get a relaxing shampoo. At first I was afraid they do not speak very good English but after a quick conversation with Stella I felt much better.\n\nThe place is not super classy and you will hear the stylists talking to each other in Cantonese every once in a while, but it's clean and they do a good job. I will definitely continue to go back."
This is first and only place I go in Pittsburgh for any sort of technology issue.  Kevin is honest and helpful.  He fixes and repairs all sort of computers and I plan to work with him to purchase my next computer.  \nI have coming running here with a dead laptop and Kevin has me back and running in under an hour.
I don't go to Dish for the culinary experience.  I do love the laid-back vibe with some good southern hangover/late night grub.  I like to order a half grilled cheese sandwish with a cup of tomato bisque.  I love that you get a deviled egg as a side to many dishes.  Nice touch.  My favorite is the black bean and rice burrito.  Cool tunes in the juke box.  Just a good local spot w/o the frills.
One of the best steak places in town. So juicy that you do not need steak sauce. Good portions as well. Decor is nothing modern or fancy. It is quite rustic. Cheese bread is addicting. Service is hit or miss which is why they lose a star. But the food is pretty amazing for a place hidden away in the northwest.
"I feel like nothing screams Charlotte as much as Lupie's cafe. Having grown up here, I cannot remember a time without Lupie's. The food is always consistent & very reasonably priced. I'll admit it is not blow your mind good, but its pretty darn tasty. The staff is always pleasant. If you're ever in the Huntersville area, they have a sister location up there."
"I have been to see the the guys at Hub Cap Annie twice. Both times were over the top, can they be any more helpful, polite and fair!!! I can not say enough good about this business.  If you need help with your tires, wheels, or hubcaps. Look them up.... Both times I was in and out and in less than 10 minutes and couldn't have been happier."
"""I had the best experience when purchasing my car from this dealership.Doug Saxton and Terry were so professional and courteous it was amazing.There was no pressure or \""""hard sell tactics\"""" that we all fear when buying a new car......They kept in touch even after I had bought the car.....please see them when in the market for a new ride.\nBe sure to say Kathie sent you......"""
"The sushi at Kiku is the best you can find around, IMO. The service is always great too. \nThe restaurant is lacking in style and lighting, but who cares if the food rocks."
"""I've lost count as to how many times I've been back to MSD... let's just say an intervention may be in my future.\n\nSuffice it to say that I think this place is simply superb. \n\n+ The bread speaks for itself. It's all amazing. \n+ The breakfast food is amongst the best in town. Their omelettes are fluffy, perfectly layered, and never over-cooked. Text book perfect.\n+ The breakfast hash... to quote Homer Simpson, \""""mmmmmmmmmm, hash.\""""\n+ The pulled pork? I smoke a mean pork shoulder, but I'd be hesitant to put mine up against theirs. \n+ Kickapoo coffee\n+ Small, but awesome selection of bottled beers\n\nIt can get a little crowded during the busier weekend hours, but do yourself a favor and wait it out. Truly 5-stars on all levels."""
"I love this place. It's so laid back, GREAT beers, cool crowd. No yuppies (that I could tell). Hard to find in Charlotte."
"Let's be clear on what the four stars are for:  the ability to sit outside, look out on one of the finest views you will see anywhere of a city, and drink a beer.  Period. \n\nThe Grandview Saloon offers several floors of dining and drinking.  The food, if I remember was probably two-three stars, but to be honest, I haven't been there since it got cold.  I think there was a new manager starting who was interested in introducing better wine and food so things may have changed since I was last there in the fall, but either way the service was always friendly and again, the views great.  \n\nIt's also been surprisingly easy to get a table outside the times I have gone there--I would have thought this place would be packed all the time. \n\nAnother nice bonus is that it is located next to the Duquesne Incline.  I enjoyed giving out-of-town guests a chance to catch the incline and then have a drink there at the top before heading back down.\n\nI look forward to warmer weather soon and getting chance to head back up there!"
"Been goin here for years and seen a handful of barbers, they're all good, no other shop compares... I just moved to henderson but I'll still be getting my cut at Gerardos"
"Tomato bisque is great, and the buffalo chicken sandwich and turkey wrap are also excellent. Can be pricey, though. Excellent beer list, which is the main reason I come here. Service is hot or miss, but the bartenders are excellent. Not the best place for a night of pool and drinking...your bill will be large."
"The tofu basil was amazing. Pounds of wilted basil- the most i have  ever seen in one dish before. SOSOSOS GOOD.  I have not tired anything else, but that was worth coming back for."
Good place. Had an Italian #19. As I was trying to figure out what to order I realized several repeat customers were there. I knew this because of the conversations they were having. Staff was very friendly. Order was quick. \n\nSo why there instead of any other sub joint?  The Bread!!  Anyone can make a sandwich but the bread was amazing. \n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving a five is the price. $8-9 for 6 inch and $9.50+ for 12 inch.
"I've been to Starborn Tattoo 4 times now to get piercings and to bring friends to get piercings.  The employees are all really nice and funny.  I could see how some people would disagree, though, because I think you need a good sense of humor to get along with everyone.\n \nThe prices of piercings are average with anywhere else I've seen and all of the ones my friends and I have received have been quality.  The place is clean and they don't mind filming or bringing multiple friends. \n \nThe one downside is the parking.  As a small female it gets a little scary parking there and walking to the building at night but usually someone will walk you out."
"Being the best pizza in Oregon is about the same prestige as being the best hockey player in Uganda, you don't get alot of bragging rights. The pizza and other menu items are decent , service good and the delivery is fast."
"""This is as good as it gets. The service, timing, and professionalism was spot on. I went in for an 11:00 apt and was out by 11:45 and paid $185 for front brakes out the door.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the feeling of comfort while you wait. There wasn't ever a time I thought \""""They are going to come and tell me something else is wrong and expensive\"""".  The other amazing thing was an elderly man who came in about 15 minutes later. This man was told he needed a fluid flush by another store and they would cut him a deal at $300, he declined and wanted a second opinion because that was a lot of money. The tech did the test and explained to him that his fluid was fine, there was no need to flush it. The elderly man shook his hand and thanked him for his help.\n\nThat right there...is enough for me. I won't take my cars anywhere else."""
holds some of my fondest memories of my college years....the grad school years when i had a car to get to this place.  i could never order anything other than the reuben and beer.  it was so good i couldn't try anything else.  oh how i miss the 1990s and this place because it doesn't seem like anything has changed here (and that is a GREAT thing).
"These are the best donuts I have had ever since I moved away from the east coast and Texas. Ever since I have moved to Vegas, I have been looking for a donuts place that sells actual donuts; none of those Krispy Kreme's so called donuts. Well, Ronald's has them!!!\n\nThey have many varieties, but I usually just get the plain, chocolate or sugar sprinkles. \n\nBottom line is, if you know better to get Krispy Kreme, you need to try Ronald's and brace yourself for some real donuts!!! Bon App\u00e9tit!"
"My experiences here have been great! Most recently I came in to replace a tire and it was done very quickly and the service was polite and friendly. They also checked on a number of other things for me for free. They didn't try to upsell me on anything, and they gave me expected time frames for the life of some of my other parts. All in all, it was quick and fairly inexpensive, as have been my previous experiences here as well."
"""\""""YUMMMMMMM\"""" - Nadia C.\n\ncalabria is awesome. the sandwiches are delishious i've tried 3-4 different sandwiches, each one was awesomeness. at under 8 bucks each, it's not as cheap as subway or other chain sandwich places but lets face it. fresh is way better.\nthe italian sandwich is my fave, the mortadella here is f'n fantastic and the salami is pure meaty awesomeness. all the deli meat is available at the counter and is sliced when sandwiches are ordered. \n\ni have not shopped here for groceries as i'm still content with safeway, fresh & easy, and sprouts. plus i'm not italian..so i do not desire all the little \""""special\"""" ingrediants for italian foods. i'm a little miffed by the hours they are open. only 4pm on a saturday and closed on Sundays? this is a little neighborhood shop. i would actually go here more if they were opened more. but it's a family business..so i guess their family is more important then running a business.\n oh well, i'll keep having wet dreams over the italian sandwich on sundays when i cannot have one. :("""
"The food was great, and so was the service.  The entrance at was a bit odd though.  There is a bar entrance at one side, and exit only door in the middle where the hostess desk is, and the restraunt entrance at the end.  My husband had been craving a teriyaki burger forever, and since they have a build-your-own burger menu he was quite happy.  I would go back for sure the service was great and our glasses were always filled."
make your own pizza! wow this is such a good price for the size of the pizza and what you want on it! they give you so much toppings compared to any other pizza joints. the only trouble i had was to take it home! it barely fit in the passenger seat so i had to drive carefully and not to slam on the breaks so i wont lose my dinner lol. ALSO im a small asian and this pizza is bigger than me! \n\nit took awhile to cook at home. i baked it in the oven it was a bit watery so i put my slice in the small toaster to dry it up a bit and to make the crust crispy. pizza is better when the crust is a bit crispy. \n\noverall i like this pizza place! \n\nif your starving and want to eat pizza right away... this isnt the place for you cuz you have to bake it yourself!
"I had to take my boys to get their hair cut for a funeral this week.  I love Daphne's bakery and noticed there was a barber shop beside their bakery so I chose this particular barber shop.  There were like 6 men and at first I felt awkward going into the shop.  However, the gentlemen were very nice and made me feel right at home.  The only downside is that they did not take credit cards - only cash or check (neither of which I had on me at the time).  They were very kind and trusted/allowed me to run to the nearest bank branch to withdraw money in which to pay them.  They were very quick and did a great job with my boys.  They can expect a return visit from us.  I was very satisfied!!!!"
Brought our rescue pup in for a ruptured cyst and they got us right in. They were super sympathetic and careful not to overstress the dog. Very pleased with the work of Dr. Stone!
"You can find their brews in local shops around town if you cant make it down to see them in person but its highly recommended that you do. \n\nThe staffs is very knowledgeable about their beers and are happy to give you a sample of whatever guest brew they have on tap that month. \n\nThe regulars were very welcoming whenever I show up and were always had a new and interesting topic to discuss from politics; to sports and even music. \n\nThe beer is always fresh, super cold and refreshing its worth the drive to experience a local brewery at its finest. \n\nOnly negative and reason I didn't give them five stars is that they don't serve food any longer; if you get hungry they are always willing to place an order for you and they have a seemingly unending list of local menus."
"This place is tucked in the back of small shopping center on Montford. I drove by this place several times a week for years and never noticed it. I stopped in one day and it is my new favorite lunch place. They have an excelent selection of top notch sandwiches and if you dine in you get a free cup of soup. I've had a few pitas and was less than impressed, but other than those everything I've had was really good. \n\nDuring lunch it gets really busy with mostly moms and older couples. During this time the waitstaff, while always friendly, seems to get overwhelmed.\n\nOn nice days they have a few tables outside at which you can sit and enjoy your lunch. And after lunch you can go get dessert at TCBY."
"Nelson is the bomb, everytime I go they make me feel like a king. My sons and I will not go anyplace else."
"When writing a review about Price's, you have to talk about the fried chicken! so let me jump right in and say it's delicious. I was a bit skeptical about what the fuss was about, but I can definitely see why people like it so much. \n\nIt's always packed in here. They only accept cash. There don't allow substitutions. And they charge for hot sauce.\n\nBut you know what? all of that stuff is fine. The chicken is awesome and the price is very very reasonable. I recall the hash browns also being really good too. The hush puppies, slaw and roll weren't bad.\n\nThe chicken was excellent. Definitely a must try when you're in Charlotte!\nDo it! boom."
"One of my favorite Indian joints, ever.  We don't live in Charlotte anymore but I still remember Jaipur fondly.  I also love the family style service.\n\nChanna masala is probably the most common curry the world over, but I swear Jaipur has some of the best.  I also love the bhindi, saag paneer, mint chutney and lentils.  Their naan is pretty darn good.  \n\nI have honestly never had a meat dish here, and I have never tried the buffet, so maybe that accounts for the poor reviews?  The owners were always really gracious to us.   I don't know why they have bad reviews on that either!"
"Renfrow's is an institution in Matthews, NC. It's been there forever and has everything you could need from a hardware store. We've gone there to have screens repaired, which they've done quickly and inexpensively. It feels like going to an old fashioned general store. Weathered, wood floors. Candy for the kids. Out back they have plants and chickens. It's almost worth going to be a tourist alone. But they do have a big stock of items as well and I love giving business to a local family run store over a huge chain any day of the week. Unlike big chains, they can actually help you out with advice with most questions you would have."
"This wonderful restaurant received a baffling unknowledgable review in the Sunday State Journal.  I've been going there for years, love it, and have never taken a friend who didn't love it.  It's packed w/Asians consistently, which speaks to its ethnic excellence.  The vermicelli bowl is scrumptious.  I like reviews and reviewers, but this one was dead wrong."
"I've been buying from this place for several years now.  It's the closest thing to buying from the noodle factories in Chinatown in San Francisco  when I was growing up and traveling to from our home in the suburbs.\n\nFreshly made noodles from the manufacturer that makes noodles for many of the top restaurants on the Strip and surrounding areas.  There is a small office in front with a price list of the available products for sale.  They sell won ton skins chow mein noodles, and all of the other Asian mainstays for Asian cooking/recipes involving Asian pasta.  Just remember that this is a CASH only transaction type of place, and try to have enough exact change handy.  Some noodles are sold by the pound also, pre-packaged  or bulk."
I ordered the crab cake sandwich with tots. I was surprised madison has seafood other than just tilapia.  I would give my order a 5 but I thought my sandwich was a bit dried but I'm sure the crab cake would be even better in the form of benedict deliciousness. I would come back to try their other items. The cookie egg roll was ehhh...maybe bluephies can start making tempura (green tea) ice cream if they're into deep fried dessert  wink wink :)
"""While this isn't my go-to Target (that would be Midtown Tar-jay), this location suits just fine if I'm bopping around South Blvd. \n\nIt's your typical store (not a super Target), with plenty of well-stocked, super clean aisles, well organized stuffs and plenty of season items. Parking is pretty much a breeze considering that Target is on the far end of this shopping center. One point I must make is about the staff....\n\nHubs and I were killing some time at this store before a matinee at the AMC next door and we were told to \""""have a pleasant shopping experience\"""" by three different Target staffers. The first time it was nice, the second time it was odd and the third time I was laughing. But hey - I appreciate the well wishes, Target. You know I'll be back..."""
"The daily specials are good, but my favorite is the Kim Chi fried rice.  It's much better if you request it with less salt.  The bubble tea selection is without equal in the area.  They have one with a mix of black tea and coffee.  Delicious...who would have thought?  haha\n\nThe seating is like that of a nice quick-service eatery: clean, crowded and comfy.  It's not ideal for large groups."
Hidden gem.
"I've stopped by this Rubio's quite a few times. Strangely enough it is probably the furthest Rubio's from where I live here in the valley. But I do have a friend who lives close by and if I'm in the area it is always nice to stop in and grab some tacos.\n\nI like Rubio's tacos. They are fresh and I have never had a bad experience with what I tend to order. I rotate between their original fish taco platter, street tacos platter, and grilled fish platter. I've never had the burritos, quesadillas, etc. On my last visit I had the street tacos platter (carne asada, chicken, and carnitas). They were all tasty and well prepared. Not fats or gristle, just good meat.\n\nThe chips are nice to dip in the beans and the numerous salsas you can get at the salsa bar. \n\nLastly, this Rubio's is clean, the employees were very nice to me and my mother (and made sure my mother did not get any guac in her meal). Overall, Rubio's is still a fave of mine, especially this location."
"Loved the expirience. Food was delicious, I just wish it was a little more spicy... but then again, I didn't ask, so its my fault. :) Russell was awesome, made all of us feel very comfortable and relaxed during our first forray into Hawaiian/Korean food.  Will most definitely be coming again! (P.S. Everything we had was delicious, but i liked the meat Jun and the korean cold noodles best). Loved the peanuts!!"
Completely agree with Seth Y. on the smell issue. Other than that the green fees are reasonable as long as you don't mind golfing in the afternoon. Everything is very organized and well marked and the course is fun and challenging for players of all skill levels. I can't wait to go back and actually get to finish 18. Slow groups should be forced off the course! Grr
"""I've been to the Biltmore shopping center plenty of times but never really \""""shopped\"""". I mainly come for the numerous restaurants they have! The entire complex is really large and can be confusing when walking around, but I don't mind since it is outdoors and very inviting. I don't want to call the Biltmore a mall, but it's very similar to an outdoor mall. However, I feel like it is less gimmicky than Desert Ridge or Tempe Marketplace. There are plenty of places to sit and relax - really relax. I like that you can unwind, when the temperatures are right! Overall, the Biltmore is nice to window shop as I'm on my way to one of the numerous restaurants in the area."""
"Yes, there are heaps of Roberto's in Vegas... and California, for that matter.\n\nI'm just adding this location because I wasn't aware of it until I drove past it after selling my kidney filling up my car with fuel at the Chevron.  \n\nGreat hard shell tacos, and rolled tacos (taquitos)... the rice is just as flavorful as the locations in San Diego.  \n\n... and I thought Roberto's only tasted good after a surf session!\n\nGive em a try!\n\n\nMahalozzzz!"
"I was very pleased to find this cafe nearish to the University and open till 11:00pm.  The coffee I had was nothing amazing, but tasty enough to drink black and that's pretty rare these days.  There is a variety of seating from comfy chairs with little tables next to them, booths, plastic furniture, metal chairs outside...whatever your preferences are it's there.  All in all it is a standard non-corporate cafe that is at the same time rather characterless and blah in style.  And the fact that there was just the one person servicing both the cafe and the connected ice cream store next door meant my friend and I were waiting for maybe 10 minutes before we could order.  I'd certainly choose this place over a Starbucks or other chain with canned decor and bad coffee, but I can also imagine that there are cuter and more comfortable cafes with more personal style somewhere near here."
A careful selection of high end items. The meat department has a pretty spectacular display of beef and pork filets and seafood.  The spice aisle was also very impressive.  I will keep this on my list of places to go for hard-to-find items or when I need a fresh perspective on grocery shopping.  But I probably won't shop here on a regular basis because it's pretty darn pricey.
"Maybe I prefer my clothes a little more urban than the average white guy but, I liked this spot and love the idea of being able to look fly on a budget.\n\nIts HUGE!  Lots of variety.  Urban wear to suits and everything in between.  Accessories too.  My only complaint is that there wasn't much service outside of the fitting rooms.  But at these prices, that was expected."
"I love going to this place for their meat jun. Doesn't have a lot of fat or any for that matter. Portions are plenty! Always have to take it home. Overall, really nice people here and good food!!"
What else can I say but the BEST. Hands down.
"I like this place a lot, but pretty much everything they carry can be had for a lot less money, albeit often with fewer frills, somewhere else.\n\nThat said, they are a GREAT source of gifts, especially for people who like to cook--my dad collects cookie cutters and they have a massive selection of those, as well as all kinds of nice cake pans and baking/serving dishes and whatnot.  I've also gotten a number of novelty silicone ice cube trays here--what can I say; I love heart-shaped (and strawberry-shaped and star-shaped and shell-shaped) ice cubes.\n\nThey also carry a very nice selection of Japanese pottery--tea and sake sets, bowls of varying sizes, etc.  I'm a bit spoiled by having lived in both Tokyo and the Bay Area, but for the upper Midwest, the selection is actually pretty decent and reasonably priced."
After reading all the rave reviews of this place I decided to trust my fellow yelpers and give it a go.\n\nReal NY pizza in Las Vegas? It couldn't be! \n\nI ordered a Large 2-topping delivered $20-Beef & Mushroom. Thin & crispy crust with nice sauce & REAL toppings. Damn Tasty!\n\nNever been to NY so I can't compare but it was just they way I ike it.\n\nThanks Yelp!
"""I have only had the pretzel stick, but it was really great! Reminded me of the Philly pretzels of my youth. Pretzel was dense and chewy and they have little packets of brown mustard. Fabulous. \n\nThe pretzel \""""sandwiches\"""" they offer look pretty atrocious, but maybe I'm just a pretzel purist."""
"Love this place! Came here a few years ago when my stylist wouldn't chop my hair off for me. I've had great experiences with everyone here, but Tamara is officially my new stylist. She knows what I want, even when I don't. \n\nI come in saying that I want long hair again but a short cut (I'm a female - we're notorious for contradicting ourselves) and she finds a way to give me exactly what I was looking for. \n\nThis is my favorite salon in town. Never see an unhappy customer here! Plus in August they are giving students and teachers a discount!  Total plus."
"One of my fave pho places in Las Vegas. The food comes out fast and the dishes are tasty. It's hard to steer away from my usual pho tai, but when I do I go for the bun bowls. I'm always stuffed to the gills when I leave and usually go home for a nap. MSG? Yeah... maybe but it's so worth it."
"This is actually for 4.5 stars.\n\nStopped in last week to get some produce on sale, like strawberries for $1.99 for a pound, and a bag of cuties for $3.49. This one, located in the Wal-Mart shopping center, is much nicer than the Tropicana store; like a brighter, cleaner, shinier version- hence the edge in stars for my review. I came here for specific items (sale items) plus we had just shopped at Wal-Mart too. But not as much as the Tropicana location (convenient to my workplace and on the way home). The frozen selections (low fat meals) were slightly higher than Smith's pricing. \n\nNice setup, clean store, few shoppers, and speedy checkout."
"Some of the best deep dish pizzas in town. If you disagree, I doubt your understanding of what makes a great pizza! I work nearby so I've had every (no joke) pizza on the menu and they are all great. The KC Barbecue, Bucky and Olympic Garden are some of my favorites."
I'm teetering between a 4 and a 5 on this one. I went for the first time yesterday and I was IMPRESSED. The restaurant was cleanly but still had an awesome downhome feeling. The hosts/hostesses and all of the wait staff was accommodating and always made sure to check back in or explain menu items. The menu is full of delicious Southern entrees that make it difficult to choose. I plan to make this a regular spot (but not too often don't want to pack on those extra pounds!) LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
"I have been going to Smoke Ranch Junction for over 5 years. It is a great place to get lost and have a great time. It is out of the way and off the beaten path. It is a Chicago Bar and a Bears Bar! No wonder the sore loser from Detroit didn't like it. The people are friendly and the place is clean, even though it has a rustic look. You couldn't ask for a better place to get away and let your hair down without leaving Las Vegas. It is my place to hang out and unwind.  I don't usually write reviews, but I recently got onto Yelp and read a 4 year old review that I just don't agree with. So check it out for yourself and see.  You be the judge."
"""Hydraulic chair shampoo stations, head massages, fetching ladies,  free mints... What more could you possibly ask for with a mens haircut? I guess just a good cut, but they've got that covered. I stopped in and got my hairs did by amanda. Needless to say, it came out pretty sweet. I actually look somewhat handsome now. Girls actually say \""""hi\"""" back when I say hello. I got hired at a new job. Booyah! Though, I think it would be completely insane to accredit this solely to my hair cut, but what the hell? Maybe, just maybe some magic happened at the tip of those scissors. I'll also note, im very pleased with the price of my life make over. 33 dollars. I dont know any life coach that can beat that...Anyways im rambling. Ill be back, globe."""
Small family owned diner style breakfast. Every thing there is great. There is not to many places like this anymore. I'm a sucker for cornbeef hash. They always have a new special every time I go. ( not sure if it's daily or weekly). They even have a stuffed omelette that has home made chilli in it. I have never seen that before. But when all is said and done every thing on the menu is good it's all homestyle cooking an reminds me of early morning breakfast as a kid.
"I love being able to do some spring cleaning and get paid for it.\n\nCleared out a majority of the dusty DVDs and some of my games for my old GameCube and the Wii.  When I say a majority I mean one of those cardboard file boxes, two large plastic totes and a slender plastic tote.  All was gone through and decent amount was given to me for nicely taken care of DVD/game collection I no longer wanted.\n\nStaff was friendly and accomodating.  Always seem to have a smile on their face.\n\nNote: if you do decide to sell items here and don't want the cash, you can get I believe 30% more if you opt for the store credit."
Good food big portions reasonably priced.
"Mediterranean Cafe is one of the few places on State Street that has a clue about what they're doing.  These people work hard and run a very efficient, friendly, and affordable operation-- you get a very good meal very fast and that is rare around here.  Please, please, please open for dinner!"
"Best sushi I've eaten, bar none. A little pricey, and service was a tad slow, but the food made up for it."
"This course is very beautiful and pretty reasonable. I found that the greens were a little rough (almost like sand). But this was during the mid summer season, so that might be the reason. Fun course with plenty of difficulty for the average golfer, such as myself."
"Loves us some pupusas! Seriously super good food at a super cheap price. We don't ever get anything else, so I'm not sure how the rest of the food tastes... But the pupusas... Mmmmm hmmm.  Good. Bean and cheese is a personal favorite. Definitely recommend!"
"There's nothing I can write that hasn't been said about this place already.    The patio is a great - and inexpensive - alternative to hanging out at some bar.  Wish they had a bit more in the way of food, but overall, nice job, CM!"
"This was my first trip to an Afghan restaurant, so I can't speak to how it compares in that respect. I had chicken curry with couscous and I thought it was delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked, not at all dry, and the curry and cous cous were tasty. My friend really enjoyed her meal as well, she had the lamb curry. My beer was awful but it wasn't anything they recommended, just something they keep in stock, so that's probably a matter of taste. The waitress was fabulous even if it took her a minute to notice us!"
"I love this office.  The whole staff is wonderful and Dr. George is super thorough. They allow you to come in the back and watch your animal be treated so you can calm them.  On times I haven't gone all the way back I could hear Dr. George discussing the things I mentioned to him with the rest of the staff..like my kitten's food preferences etc. It's just a homey, nice place where you feel your pets are getting wonderful, attentive care each time."
"I took my mother here for a check up and the staff were very helpful and friendly.  Dr. Rober Gaimaro truly cared for my  mother and treated her very gently and gave her a thorough examination. He knew that my mother also did not have any health insurance therefore he recommended some alternatives that are cheaper for her prescriptions and also told us where to go that were offering generic specials. This is truely a place where the Dr. himself and staff cares for you and not just your money. I love this place, my mother who had been through so many other clinic who had treated her badly will never go anywhere else  but here. I recommend this place to anyone and also specially to the elderly people."
I liked the kiosk ticketing. You can tell the theaters are getting used pretty hard but it is still a pleasant place to see a flick. I would expect an update from them in the next couple years considering how many people in the Concord area frequent this movie theater. Prices for refreshments could be lower...
"I love a good bargain and there are many to be found here. Not only are there a plethora of awesome things, they are all super cheap because duh, it's a thrift store. For example, I got a spice rack and a fruit bowl for $1.90. And here I thought a dollar couldn't buy anything anymore. I also saw a sweet armchair for $6 (but alas, I have nowhere to put it.) My favorite section is housewares, but they also have the usual clothes, furniture, and books section. So save up all your pennies and go wild. (The only con I can think of is the dust; I sneezed up a storm in there.)"
Best pep boys I've been to!! The customer service is stellar and they will take care of you when your in need. I walked in needing my brakes fixed 20 mins before they closed and not only did they accommodate me but they finished in less than an hour. Come here for all of your car service/repair needs!
"The smell of coffee hits you when you first walk in. It is a great scent.  It's what a coffee place should be like. \n\nI ordered the White Russian drip coffee. It's really good stuff and I wish that I lived closer to this place.  Coffee was warm but not hot. I could probably stick my hand in the cup and without injury. \n\nI walked in and there was nobody behind the counter. I waited. Waited some more. It felt like ages. Finally someone comes out from somewhere, takes my order and not all that pleasant. Tells the person behind me that she's bored. I was bored waiting for her. Good experience except for customer service and warm coffee-  so 3.5 stars rounds to 4. \n\nSeems like a good grab a coffee and sit type of place. Not a fast food-like coffee shop."
"""Kimchi is the staple food for any Korean restaurant. The owner waits on you at this location and he is THE MAN.  Kimchi is first class as I haven't had kimchi of this quality in a long time. Comparable if not better than any so called, \""""First Class Korean Restaurant\"""" in LA, NYC, Bergen County(NJ). I've been to all of them and this Kimchi is up there.  The other food is not worth the trip if you are in a mood for cold noodle or the soft tofu soup. But the kimchi makes up for lack of flavor from any other dishes on the menu. The service is too good to not make the trip, so if you are in Las Vegas, check this place out.  It has once way window from the inside so open the door or ring the bell.  You won't regret it."""
"Ok so I have to update my review and give them another star!  I have spent a lot of time recentley traveling and have not have too much time to go to this place (one of my favorites!)  Anyway since I've been making it my weekly tradition again I must say they are better than ever.  Last time I was there the service was extra good and so was the sushi.  I have some friends coming in from out of town soon and I can't wait to take them there....I don't think they believe me when I say it exists!  Trust me when I say places this resonable,  equally good, and with such a huge selection do not exist in Chicago.  In fact i'm heading there tonight to eat some sushi and hopefully they have the ALCS on.  Trust me guys don't let this place get away!"
"We had prix fixe menu.  Most items were excellent, but the scallops left much to be desired."
the guy that works register is always there..and u can tell he is visably tired but always gives great service..And food is always on point
"The ladies there are very helpful, things are decently priced and will order anything for you...\n\nif you ask for tips they will take time to throughly answer every question, even the one you probably wouldn't have thought about until you got home!"
"If you don't like the Chicken Coop, something is wrong with you. That simple."
"Seriously, what more could I ask for? I love Asian food, yet, I don't shop at Asian markets...until now. I am starting to cook more Asian dishes and I remembered my yelp friends suggesting this place. Thanks, friends!\n\nFirst of all, I was quickly overwhelmed by the amount of aisles of food, cooking items, and whole fish on ice. However, after I acclimated to the store I was able to find what I needed and my shopping basket became full quickly. If there was an item that I was unsure of or I couldn't locate, the woman behind the counter was very eager to help. By the way, if you are looking for chicken feet, pig heart, ox tail, or the like, you can find it here.  \n\nI will definitely be going back to this place because they have everything (at least what I need) and I spent half of what I would have at any other main grocery store. I encourage you to bring your own bags as well...they were really appreciative that I did."
"I have been looking for good British food in Pittsburgh for almost as long as I've been here... and I found it.\n\nI stopped in on a Saturday night for the (extensive) Scotch selection but stayed for the Chicken and Mushroom Cottage Pie. If it's any indication of the rest of their traditional British menu, I don't know why you'd go anywhere else. It was flavorful, filling, and all around delicious.\n\nBartender Cortney knows his Scotch, too, which is very helpful considering their gigantic selection. They have half of their back bar dedicated to single-malt goodness.\n\nIt's also worth noting that, for a South Side Saturday night, the place was not packed and filled with the usual stereotypes. It is largely a restaurant, of course, but the environment is very classy. Seems like it might keep the annoying crowds at bay a little.\n\nAll said, I wish I could live here. I'll be back."
"Although it is not obviously the healthiest choice for a late night snack, nothing beats a warm, fresh, doughnut from Greenbush. \n\nAnything is good when it is fresh out of the oven, but I'm a big fan of the apple fritter.  One of the largest doughnuts on the menu, but also one of the most delicious, sugary, treats.  Ever.  You can pretend like you'll share it with your friends, but I guarantee that once you bite into it you won't want to!"
"Great Pizza, Great Price, Great People.\n\nFrom street view this family owned pizza shop would not have been my fist choice, but I was being treated so I did not object. The white pizza was really good, I couldn't get enough. The seats were not very comfy and the decor is nothing to write about, but they made up for it with their service!"
"The guys wanted a good steak dinner. We decided to go to The Range Steak House and we were not dissapointed. The guys each got a rare 24 oz porterhouse  cooked to perfection! It looked so mouthwatering, I had to have a bite. It just melted in your mouth the way a good steak should! I opted for the blackened salmon. The seasoning was a bit salty for me, but the salmon itself was cooked just right! The sides: asparagus and baby mushrooms, were great compliments to the main course. Yeah, it was a bit pricy, but it was worth it. One bad issue is that it did take Forever to get the bill! Would I go back?... probably."
"I have found a replacement for my favorite college coffee shop.  The caramel macchiato here is a fitting replacement for my beloved T-spoons in Iowa City.  And boy was I relieved.  I was beginning to think no one could get it right and I was doomed to an eternity of sub par lattes.  Well that's enough with the dramatics, but it really is a very nice place.  The staff are friendly, and the service is fast.  Plus that lovely coffee smell that permeates everything."
"Where do I even start?\n\nAs Inner Fire has grown through the years, they just keep adding to their roster of lovely and motivational teachers. They offer enough classes throughout the day that if one teacher doesn't blow you away, you can easily try another. Everyone who works there and (most) of those who practice there are welcoming and open.\n\nLike another reviewer said, your first class -- or first few classes -- will make you feel dizzy and nauseous. Don't despair, it happens to everyone. You just have to hold on to the fact that it will feel better. Promise! \n\nDefinitely try it out. Student rates are good, and there are some free community classes offered on weekends."
"This is an old time plastic menu breakfast place by my parents house.  Looks like ypour typical IHOP. Trusted by fellow yelpers on this one. The pancakes were the star. Made from scratch and very good. Portion size for a short stack could feed two, no problem.\nHadn't had this type of food in a long time. Kept me full and satisfied all day."
The locals love this place. It is one of those places that you JUST KNOW someone will suggest for lunch in either Dilworth or uptown.\n\nIt is good- don't get me wrong. I like the pizza with pear on it (trust me). The crust is thin- the way I personally prefer. The salads are fresh. The outdoor area in Dilworth is nice.\n\nIt is a bit overpriced though and I will never understand the undying love that the locals have for it (really- there is a huge fan club)
"Both my dogs are patients at Gentle Doctor. I found this place through research and reviews after their previous vet moved out of town.\n\nTheir primary vet is Dr. Dawsey, but they've seen Dr. Fujikawa a couple times as well. Both doctors are wonderful, very gentle, very patient, always available in person or by phone to answer my questions and concerns. They give me very in-depth descriptions of procedures, products, health issues, etc. if I ask for it; they are very knowledgeable and professional.\n\nThe staff is always on top of things, keeping the hospital clean, calm and surprisingly quiet. I've never boarded them here but wouldn't hesitate to do so. I had to leave one dog for most of the day to repair a torn nail. He was sleepy but calm and unstressed when I picked him up. Dr. Dawsey called a couple times to check up on him in the following days to make sure he was doing well."
"This  Eat n Park  location is pretty good.  What I really like about this place is that it essentially the zone 4 police stations real HQ.  Go to the station house and there might be a disinterested officer behind the desk.  Instead just head over to the eat n' park on Murray.  No doubt you'll find at least four officers, especially in the morning.\n\nYou'll be able to feel quite safe while you enjoy your smiley waffle."
"If you're broke, love tasty burgers and live in Da Burgh or just visiting.... THIS IS YOUR PLACE! I love this place... CHEAPEST BURGERS IN TOWN! The only down side is... it's not 24 hour! I now live back in California and a tear comes to my eye every time a thought passes through my mind of my dear Pickle Barrel... tasty morsels.... out as fast as they went in. WE WILL REUNTIE THIS SOON!"
"Today, I was lucky because I went with co-workers who one of them is from the Sichuan Province. He ordered for all of us and got 4 dishes which were all Szecuan Cuisine. He ordered in Chinese and he did not know how to translate in English to us. Please check out the photos that I took for the delicious dishes that we ate.\n\nEmperor's Garden is definitely not for the American Chinese Cuisine, which I can see why this restaurant has mostly bad reviews. You will not find Chinese Broccoli with Beef if so, it may not be good. \n\nHowever, the authentic Szecuan Cuisine was really really good and very spicy which I love. \n\nI will definitely come back here as long as my co-worker is with me."
"Good food with a fun atmosphere.  I like everything that I get here, sometimes they get a little crowded and the service can be slightly on the slow side, but overall it's worth at least one visit."
"A tad pricy, average portions, but it's the best chinese food I've had in the states of Pennsylvania and Michigan"
"I love the Biltmore. Now, if I only had the money to shop there. Sure, there are some more averaged priced places...Macy's, Borders, MAC, Pottery Barn, but most of them are truely top shelf retail establishments.  Gucci, Saks, This Little Piggy Wears Cotton, Tommy Bahama, Betsy Johnson, etc line this outdoor shopping layout.  \n\nMy favorite part is that on Fridays (at least they used to do this, havent been on a Friday in a while), they have an open air market in the middle of all the shops complete with fresh fruits and vegtables, and hand crafted gifts.  \n\nDuring the summer an outdoor mall is a bit intimidating but once it dips below 100 degrees, this up scale shopping experience is much more than just browsing for new shoes."
Great old school restaurant excellent service tasty prime rib  \nTable side preparation of dishes.  \nDo not be fooled by the location in a strip mall\n\nWould have been 5 stars but tne steak Oscar was tough \nThanks Tom for the service
"Been coming to NY P and P since 1994. Nothing has changed, and that's a good thing. No frills, down to earth Italian eatery. The pizza is much better if you eat it there, hot and fresh. I live near Mark Riches new york pizza and pasta, and this is not the same place. It's much, much better! Meatball and chicken parm subs are some of the best i've ever had. Just remember..the food will taste twice as good if you sit down and eat it there!"
"I wish I lived right around the corner from this bar.  We stumbled on this place after japanese curry where they did not serve any alcohol.  The bartender was a sweet, awesome lady who took a real interest in her customers.  She bounced from group to group, talking and socializing.  The drinks are cheap and they come fast.  There really isn't much to not love about this place.  Man up, ring the doorbell and have fun!"
"""Not sure what was BETTER!...the food or the service?\n\nEvery time I stop at this location the staff is just so welcoming. For a \""""fast\"""" food service I wouldn't necessarily expect it but the people that work there must love their job because it seems apparent. They are so friendly, every time. The food is always awesome. Fresh and fast. Reasonably priced as well. Love, love, love."""
"The guys at Grand Avenue Pizza (which I'm trying to get people to start calling The GAP) recommended a great pho place called 43rd Express. We went there the other day as their kitchen was closing, so they gave us free macaroons to express their condolences. They were like ice cream heroin. And their generosity cemented the place in our tastebuds, so we went back the following day. Great pho, all around, but the best part was the Egg Soda. I haven't found one of those in a while. I will definitely be coming here more regularly."
"Now, I have never stayed at this hotel.  However, I will worked closely with Ben Glanz reserving rooms for various functions and he is phenomenal.  \n\nHe is accessible, he works diligently to make sure we have the space we need and that my people are taken care of.\n\nThanks Ben!\n\nAs for the hotel - my staff who stays at the hotel enjoy the large rooms, fridges, and the evening meet and greets that the hotel sponsors.  The shuttles take them where they need to go and, if they ask nicely, the shuttles will take them beyond their scope.  \n\n5 stars.\n\nthanks\nAimee"
"Went today for an oil change and they're closed, for lease sign up and no one at the place, it appears HondaTronics is no more (hopefully they find a new location)"
"After reading the reviews on the 5 star rated Dekes I gave them a call on October 23rd.  I was surprised and thankful they were able to come out on the same day!  Steve gave me a time frame - called me 30 minutes prior to showing up.  He is very nice and respectful I felt he was honest about my heater repair, I don't feel like he was trying to rip me off, which I am very thankful for!\n\nMy condo is upstairs, I felt bad that he had to keep going up and down to the roof - he did not complain, he did not seem irritated -he simply said this is my job and I will fix your problem!!!\n\nI will refer Dekes -100% \n\nThanks again Steve!"
"The food and service are both very good, I do however wish they where open later on weekdays with me being a 3rd shifter the options can be somewhat limited.  I do appreciate that they have no problem calling when the driver arrives."
"Ate here on the last night of our (Mikie, Sarah & I) Fatty Weekend trip.  We had been walking and knew we needed food before starting out drinking shenanigans but probably chose this place because of the bar we could sit at.\n\nGood grub and a cool bartender that was attentive and had a nice dry wit.  I had a tasty burger and even more tasty Jack and Coke...or 3.  I don't quite remember.  I think there were some shots too.  Right? It's probably best that I don't remember..."
"""Very helpful and friendly staff ready to help running pros and newcomers alike. They did a great job of helping fit me for a pair of shoes, carefully watching my feet and working through subtleties in shoe design that I would have missed.\n\nThey have a nice selection of other running merchandise, too, and were equally as helpful with those items.\n\nI am knocking one star for the very strict \""""you better like your $100+ pair of shoes\"""" return policy. Happily I haven't regretted my purchase."""
"My husband and I went for a motorcycle ride.  We ended up in this part of town.  Not normally somewhere where we'd eat...simply because it is so far from our house.\nWe split a platter...one beef and one chicken enchilada with rice, beans, chips and salsa.  Really tasty!  Their chunky, pico de gallo salsa is delicious.  Wasn't a huge fan of their hotter salsa.  Reasonable prices and good service.  It hit the spot for our day ride.\nIf this was closer to us, I'd make it a point of going back there.  Not necessarily good enough to make a 45 minute trek though."
Come after 11pm to get half price on almost everything on the menu.
"I have been using this club since it opened.  I swim and use the locker room.  My only complaint is that they do not know how to clean the tile floors.  I see the cleaning person with a string mop, which is basically just spreading dirty water over the floor.  The floors are in need of professional steam cleaning."
Dr. Alex is the best! Years of tightness in my back and shoulders is gone! Ive been in to see him at least 10 times and i havent felt this good in years. Hes very knowledgeable and taught me a lot of different stretches I can do to keep myself feeling right.
"Some co-workers talked me into Lo Lo's, so I tried it.  Loved it, but thought I could feel the blood flow in my arteries slow down.  The food is great tasting, but it may not prolong your life.  But, hey, none of us can live forever.  Their chicken is the best, cooked golden brown and crispy.\n\nThe restaurant is located just south of downtown Phoenix in an old house.  There is not much space inside the house, so if you go there for lunch, leave early.  There are lines out the front door after 12 noon.  If you are in Phoenix, you have to try Lo Lo's.  There is nothing else like it."
It is hard not to say the same thing that hasn't already been said. The folks at this establishment really know how to put together great food and good atmosphere. Beer selection is really good. Whisky selection is fantastic. Wait staff and bartenders are very good as well. They genuinely want to be there. This is my new favorite spot to eat when I am in Pittsburgh.
"In town for a week been here 3 times! Food is very addiction tasty!  I order combo fried rice, ragoon and curry noodles.  Place is a dump (carry out place),  location is hard to find around high traffic road.  but all I care about is the good tasting food."
"Stickler's is a great place to grab a quick lunch.   The prices are good, and the quality is solid.  They have a good selection of sandwiches, toppings, and an excellent build your own salad option.  It is definately a cut a cut above it's competition.  I haven't tried the ice cream and shakes, but I hope to soon.  My only major complaint is that the hours are fairly limited.  Sticklers closes early during the weak and is closed on weekends, which is pretty normal for downtown restaurants.  You should definitely stop in if you want a fast and quality lunch in downtown Phoenix."
"I really thought the food was great, for breakfast stuff.  Passing by a table, I saw a couple order omlettes....  My God!!  These things were like 4 inches thick and looked like shepherds loaves of bread!!\n\nI ordered Eggs Benidict (Venitian Style) with the sauce on the side.  It comes with potato pancakes.  Muffin, mushrooms, spinich and wonderfully poached eggs that look like mounds of sour cream.  Perfect!  My wife had 3 egg breakfast or something basic like that, also good.  Try the Venitian Eggs!"
"The guy was super helpful while advising me on the best way to ship my envelope. He thoroughly explained all of my options, and since this was an important letter, I really appreciated that.\n\nI also got a few documents notarized. No complaints. It was quick and easy. I'll remember this store when I have something else to ship."
We have been going here since 2007. Whether we have an appointment or an un scheduled visit we always recieve great care for our dog and are never made to feel like any concern we have is too small. We have also used the boarding facilities on occasion and have had no problems. The doctors are caring and kind and to me that is all that matters for the dog I love so much.
"Hip-hip-HOORAY for the lovely people at this UPS Store.\n\nI came in the other a day a bit disheveled, overwhelmed and in my pajamas. Low and behold stood an angel to rescue me... an angel in the form of the notary. She was one of the NICEST people I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with at a business. \n\nShe took the time to help me first understand everything I needed... then second took care of it all with a huge smile on her face. Quick, painless and easy. Did I mention how nice she is? I almost gave her a hug, but wasn't sure if that was appropriate. \n\nOn top of the friendly staff, the prices are so affordable. They even had a list of specials and discounts going on at the time. What's better than cheap printing? Even cheaper printing!\n\nThe store is super convenient if you are in the South End area. It's located right off South Boulevard. I will definitely take all my future copy-scan-print-ship-notary-lamination needs here."
"Picked up a bottle of wine before heading to a nearby hotel.  State run store, being from NY, it's the same prices I usually pay.  Friendly people."
"Ok so at this point of Cinco de Mayo, it is possible that I would have thought any food was amazing. However, their french fries out of a bucket and microwaved carnival cheese was out of this world good, and I think they had the cheapest drink prices we had seen all day. Good food. Cheap. I'm in."
Friggin epic sandwiches.  Pretty busy - parking is a pain.  The sandwiches are AMAZING though.\n\nDon't be in a hurry here - takes a good 10-15 minutes to get your order.  I don't care - it rules.
"If you're tired of waiting in line at all the big hotels and want to eat brunch off the strip, this is where you should go.  All the plates we ordered we're filling and large.  Some noteworthy items on the menu: Chicken fried steak, pumpkin and banana bread, and the corned beef hash!"
"""Any conceivable spice you may need is probably at Penzey's.  In what could be an overwhelming experience, Penzey's lays out its retail store in simple terms--salads, baking, soups, pepper, etc.  Each spice is available in a variety of sizes, allowing you to try new items without committing to a huge jar.  Descriptions and samples of each spice let you \""""smell before you buy\"""" and suggested recipes are posted for taking home.  Gift boxes of spices are available--I'd never considered giving spices as gifts before, but Penzey's makes it seem...right."""
"We were here for my boyfriend's work Christmas party last night and I have to rave about the food.  The food potions for the evening were crab cakes and a filet. The filet melted in your mouth. It was by far one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. \n\nThe down side was the only option for dessertwas cheese cake.  I am lactose intolerant. The salad was a Caesar.  I don't like lots of dressing and it was swimming. It was good, but over dressed for my tastes. \n\nThe view was amazing. The city looked great as always. The room we were in was long and narrow. it was hard talk to others because of the narrow room. \n\nWe will definitely go back."
"Look, working downtown means that I have tried the sandwiches at every chain place in town, be it Subway or Silver Mine.  I say with confidence that Cousin's is the best cold sandwich you can buy.  This place is really simple, with about a dozen sandwiches that have lots of meat, good vegetables, and good bread.  The portions are the biggest for the money in town.  Admittedly the meat isn't fantastic, but it is recognizable what meat you are eating.  Furthermore, if you try and get too fancy with ordering hot food etc, you will probably be disappointed.  But, if you are hungry and want a sandwich close to the Capitol, this is the place to be."
"Hands down, favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and probably favorite Taiwanese restaurant ever!\n\nI love almost every single dish they have on the dinner menu.  I would stay away from the fried rice and fried noodles, etc though.\n\nThe intestine dish is perfectly spiced, perfectly flavored and perfect for a cold night.  Their three cup chicken is unmatched anywhere else! \n\nEven their milk tea is fantastic!  Perfect blend of milk and tea flavor with tasty sweet chewy tapioca balls.  \n\nThe wait is pretty bad since so many people know how fantastic of a restaurant this is so come prepared or come during off peak hours.  The place is small too so I wouldn't come in too big of a group unless you want to wait even longer. \n\n\nSigh, Rose Tea, how I miss thee..."
"This place surprised me. Good coffee at 4 pm on a Saturday afternoon is unheard of, but I found it here. I did not try the bread but I will. I did order a croissant, and despite Rachel F feeling that they didn't live up to her summer in France, I will evaluate them based on my many experiences in France as well as my many travels all over the world and extensive sampling of croissants, I can say, they are not bad. In fact, the taste is actually pretty good. They are not truly buttery or flaky as a croissant should be, they are more dense, bread like. In fact they are more of a crescent roll than a croissant, but if you just evaluate them against other cafe croissants, you would agree they are not bad.,"
"Save-Mor Beer, you make the ridonkulous PA liquor laws slightly tolerable.  They carry my beloved Abita brand, and have a huge selection of many other local, national and international breweries. There's a walk- in cooler section with your normal beers, nothing fancy in there though.\nPlus, their commercial can't be beat!"
"I've been here a few times and the food has been wonderful. I've only gotten the deep-fried cod with fries, but it's always delicious with tasty tartar and coleslaw on the side. \n\nOnly thing keeping me from making this a five-star review is that it's served a little cold - could be hotter from the get-go."
"""Mary's is the best for alterations in Madison.  The young woman who works there is super friendly and a talented seamstress.  They are consitently quick with their alterations and friendly.  When I am in Madison I will only come here for my alterations.  Price is average for their alterations.  I remember giving them the difficult task of making a \""""bell bottom\"""" jean into a skinny leg jean.  The alteration looks flawless, you can't tell it was once a retro jean, and the cost was $20.\n\nSupport local businesses!  We need Mary's in Madison for a long time."""
"Micheals is good stuff. This is excellent custard. Flavorful, smooth, rich. When I judge custard I try to look past the flavors of the day, the novelty sundaes, the toppings, and zero in on the taste and flavor of plain ol' vanilla. If the vanilla is good, then the custard is good. Micheals' has excellent vanilla. Micheals is, therefore, excellent custard."
AWESOME HANG OVER FOOD. \n\ngood drink prices and really good comfort food at great prices.  The service is cool.  \n\nNote that there is smoking inside so you'll either a. love that information or b. hate that information.
"""Vegan donuts; what is this about?... These donuts pass for grade A, top choice donuts. You can't even tell they are \""""vegan\"""". One of the best donuts I've ever had. and the prices are reasonable ($.75/donut and $.85 for the bigger donuts) Glazed donuts were fresh, airy and mmmm just so good. The others we tried were the chocolate donut, bear claw, and the donut holes. Now, I don't want to leave out the apple burrito. We just had to try that, and let me just say that it was \""""off the hook\"""" good!!! Remember McDonalds back in the day when they fried their apple pies? There you go! I am definitely going back to Ronalds Donuts when I go back to Vegas."""
"By far a leader in Madison steakhouses.  Craig runs a right ship and it shows in the joint's consistently well executed food,  thoughtfully balanced wine list and well timed food/beverage delivery. \n\nHits: Wedge salad and petite fillet. \n\nMisses:  Undercooked hash browns...that the kitchen will remedy if you order them extra crispy. \n\nHints: Ask for a booth next to the bar if you  want a more casual, private meal."
LOVE Popeyes.\n\nPros:\nBest fried chicken there is.\nThe sides are AMAZING. \nTakes me back to my roots.\n\nCons:\nPrices are a lot steeper than they used to be.\n\nI've eaten so much Popeye's that I think a few years have already been trimmed off my life.........pretty good way to die I suppose.
"Hands down best BBQ in Las Vegas, macaroni and cheese is out of control. If your in Vegas and want BBQ this is the place"
"Simply AWESOME! I wouldn't even bother calling anyone else. On time, professional, friendly. What more could you ask for?"
"ive only had the bistec de puerco but it was so good. rice and beean, good. plantanos, good. everything that anyone that ive gone with has been good. i would go here all the time if it was closer to my house."
"The hardest part is deciding what to eat and, so far, I've discovered that you can't go wrong.\n\nI've been several times for lunch and brunch. Ordering off the printed menu is always solid and so are the daily specials. Chili braised chicken sandwich is my lunch pick and the chorizo corn omelet is my breakfast go-to. The salads are also great and super satisfying. \n\nOne word of warning: there's bound to be a loooong wait at peak times, so try to beat the crowd."
"No menu is posted outside (wish there was), but we took the plunge and headed downstairs to check it out.  The menu was fun to peruse, and I was pleased because there were several vegetarian options to choose from.  Entrees were served on either rice or ethiopian bread and were moderately sized and served with a side salad.  Several African beers were offered, which were fun to try.  Our waitress was not overly friendly, but attentive enough to be fine with me.  The main room seems to offer a bit more ambiance than the back room, which felt a little lacking in that department.  I'm not sure if it was the overhead lighting or the chairs, which felt a little rec room-like.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Fair prices and several veg-friendly options.  I was glad we tried it and it was enjoyable enough for me to recommend."
"The tour was great for the most part. The tour bus arrived on time for pick up and the tour guide was entertaining and funny. We actually got a tour inside the dam and got to see what goes on underneath it. There was a museum which shows how the dam was created. The tour was very informative and interesting. My favorite was walking across the dam. I have a fear of heights, so looking down was a problem! Part of the tour that I went on included a visit to a nearby chocolate factory. The factory was ok, there wasn't any chocolate being made that day, so I was kinda bummed. I did get a free sample though. But I felt the factory tour wasn't necessary. I would rather just visit the dam and nothing else. But I got a package that include other tours beside the dam. So if you want to visit the dam, either go on your own or try to get a tour where you just visit the dam."
"""If you know me well, you know my favorite milkshake is a Butterfinger milkshake. I don't know why...it could be the teenage summer I spend drinking one a day...but anyway, when I want something cold, delicious, and slurpable, I always opt for a Butterfinger shake.\n\nAnd that's where Mr. K's comes in. Holy goodness. I haven't really tried anything else on the menu, since we usually come just for dessert. But the Butterfinger shake with hot fudge is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nService is speedy, and friendly enough. Nothing over the top. It's a TOTAL old-school burger joint and you can see the flat top sizzling when you order. I always see tons of people enjoying standards like burgers, fries, hot dogs, and the like. \n\nIt's adorable when older couples, who likely have been patrons since the place opened in 1967, walk in and order \""""the usual.\"""" Makes my head spin with happiness.\n\nGo to Mr. K's. Do it. Go for dinner or a shake. And be happy."""
"Holy cow! Great steaks and a good selection of single malt scotch. If you are not a BIG eater, don't go here. Huge portions are served here and the service is not bad. Since it's at Sam's Town, it's kind of out of the way. But worth it. \nPrices not bad either."
"So how could you ever say anything bad about this place???  Excellent, exciting beer selection with rotating seasonal selections, lots of wine, fun variety of NA drinks, a small bar with local craft brews (also rotating regularly), various sundries and snack foods, CANDY, PBR, and a deli with both omni and veg options.\n\nThe patio is always hopping, and on weekends they play live music on the back lanai.  The staff is hip, but not too cool for school (as they don't act like they're too cool to be friendly), and it's a crazy mashup of people.  I come here basically every night after work, and fucking love it."
"Love love love love love this place!\n\nSuper casual, no fuss no muss kinda place! I love that for Vegas....I've done the whole stay and a super duper nice Hotel pay lots of $ for what? A  room that I don't really see much, but to sleeping, and go get ready. Love the 25 cent chicken wing promo =]\n\nMy only complaint is the Hooters girls when I was there were NOT HOT! I guess I just assumed Vegas Hooters girls would be drop dead gorgeous...for what it's worth you get what you pay for and if you wanna stay somewhere laid back, casual and cheap...this is the place for you!"
"This is the clear winner in Vegas for taco joints! Everything we had was spectacular, but the Carne Asada tacos took the prize!!\n\nGet a Sandia! It will make you want to take back all the bad things you did as a kid! It's that good.\n\nBeats Abeulas and I did not think that was possible."
"I LOVE Selwyn Pub for a laid-back evening when you want to stay local.  I must admit - I must be getting old cause it is TOO LOUD inside at the bar for me.  The music is old school which i LOVEEEE but it is so loud I can't wait to leave.  \n\nOutside is heaven tho - an all evening (or afternoon) cozy spot to chit chat with the locals  Not a super-young crowd, mostly business professionals and college grads.  Plenty of tables and couches and seating - just a super outdoor patio!\n\nThe bathrooms are TINY - just two stalls ladies and be careful you are not standing behind the door if someone comes in."
"Stopped in relatively early on a Friday night to enjoy $1 drinks till 9 PM. Charlie's was pretty empty, which everyone kept saying was unusual, but I don't typically enjoy large crowds so I was fine with just a handful of people around.\n\nEveryone working there were nice and friendly. Drinks were strong. I love the outdoor seating area - there's covered areas, areas that look like bleachers, regular tables, and areas to stand. There's also a volleyball area which looks pretty fun. Inside was an amazing dance floor that was just getting started when we left. I could see that being an awesome time.\n\nOverall I had a nice time. I would stop in again when it isn't super busy."
"This place is the same as the one in Anaheim, ca. The place wasn't packed as I thought it would be. Great service, the food came as fast and coffee was refilled without asking. Definitely will come back if I'm in the area since it's about 30 mins away."
"Eaten here 50 or more times.\n\nFood is very good, always clean. Hot and sour soup is always great.\n\nServes canned soda but I don't see that as a drawback unless you expect free refills.\n\nJenny - the owner is really sweet but gets lost with big tables and it has helped that she always has help now with the table service."
"Nice standard all around starbucks.  \n\nI like to get my hot chocolate here some mornings if its not too packed.  A couple of the girls and guys actually know what I want when I come in and it's already started for me-so kudos to them.\n\nSometimes they are training in the morning,  which can slow things down... But overall a solid place to get some hot cocoa in the morning. The barista's are knowledgeable and very quick and concise. \n\nThis particular location is always clean, Lots of seating indoor and outside, though I wish there were some big cushy seats like you find in other starbucks. There's always tons of free Wifi-types here doing homework or goofing off on their laptop. \n\nIf your just committed a crime, and decide you immediately needed a coffee afterwards....you should probably avoid this Starbucks- Local police love to sit and have a brew with each other in between and during shifts here. lol\n\nCheers! \n\n-MikeB"
"Vegas doesn't have much to offer in the way of food, except on the strip. Who wants to go to the strip every night for a meal? This place is amazing. Definitely the best Thai food I have ever had. Every time I walk out of there I just rave about how amazing my meal was. The papaya salad and the Panang chicken are to die for. The service is awesome and the decor is really nice. This is a must check out in Vegas."
"OMG!!! My favorite bakery and their Vegan!!! My girls have major allergies to dairy and eggs, so this place was my savior for desserts for them... Love everything here!!"
Great comedians at a good price. Drinks are a little pricy but beer is average priced. Always a fun.
"Well, for one, I am a Green Bay Packer fan.... but that's not why we're here are we?! Great pizza, burgers and salads! The brewery brews some of the best beers ever and the seasonals are exellent. Brats are awesome and you can get a burger with brat, hamburger and a pretzel bun! MMMMMM!!!"
"One of the more unique places in Madison.  It feels comfortable, the lighting is pleasant and the food is classic Italian.  It reminded me of the East Coast Italian restaurants of my youth.  \n\nThe pizza was good, the garlic bread was just ok and the standout was the caesar salad (ask for the anchovies).  The smoked trout pasta was tasty if a bit heavy.  The thin crust pizza ranks as some of the better pizza in Madison (Lombardino's is still better).  \n\nThere are two reasons Greenbush lost a star:  the prices and the acoustics.  \n\nPrices are reasonable but not great - although I must admit they use local farm-raised meats and eggs which I'm sure cost more.  \n\nThe acoustics are HORRIBLE when its full (which it was on a Wednesday night when we visited).  They really need to invest a few acoustic tiles for the low ceilings.\n\nOverall a solid a player on the Madison restaurant scene."
"This review is for eyebrow threading. I relocated to PGH from Chicago and have been searching a good couple of months for a place to get my brows threaded. I was about to haul it out to Monroeville Mall from Squirrel Hill, but checked YELP and decided to give Junee a try in Oakland. I'm glad I did. Junee has great customer service skills. She asked me how much I wanted off and after she was done asked me if I was pleased with it and even touched up a few spots after a triple inspection. As everyone says, she's super sweet and polite. I highly recommend her. Cash only, $12 + tip."
Went there since the vegetarian spot next door was closed.  Pizza is pretty good.  I'd eat the crust alone..yummy.  Nice staff...I'm killing my diet!
"As far as the food goes, this place is A-OK. As an Eat 'n Park, I give this location 4 stars. As I stated previously, the late night staff are pretty awesome and hella patient. If I worked here,  I'd be fired within a week. \n\nThe remodel looks great, I love all of the Murray Ave.  pics that adorn the walls and kudos to the E&P brand for supporting local growers and incorporating them into their menu."
"Luv-It Frozen custard is honestly, beyond words. I've been going to this place since I was little. Hands down, THE best frozen dessert EVER, and I feel bad for you if you've never tried it. \n\nIf you don't know what to order, just know, anything and everything you decide on will be amazing.\n\nx"
"this is a great dive bar.  it's also a great place to play pool where the people aren't assholes if you aren't awesome.  the drinks are cheap and the people are real.  on a side note, my parent's got engaged here when it was a mexican restaurant."
"""Was very leery of a fish-taco place... but I am sold!!! I am trying to talk my other half into giving it a go...and I am betting he will be converted too!\nWent with a friend who knows all the out of the way, non-chain places to eat. Had the corn salsa-yum! Liked the beer-batter fish. Very crowded, not big on the \""""ambience\""""...but it was soooo good!"""
"Excellent helpful staff, helped me choose an air filter that can be cleaned and will save me money and windshield wipers and helped me install them in the vehicle."
"SHO GOOD.\n\nCame here for a graduation dinner and the food just kept on coming.  \n\nThings I remember before I was blinded by a plate bigger than my upper body of lobster:\n\nBlack bean fish\nHoney walnut shrimp\nChinese brocolli\nDuck\nLamb\nClay pot beef\n\nThe waiters made up for a lost pre-ordered food list by giving us a discount for the lobster. Service was alright for a Chinese place, but food was just delectable!  \n\nPretty big space as well."
"love it.\nThe building seems huge, but that is because of the soaring ceilings.\nThere us usually something local and edgy at this gallery.\nI remember sitting across the street eating at some fairly windowless corner bar (that is now a cosi!) and watching the demo/construction.\nA crane came through and hit a pipe.  Water sprayed like a fountain all over the place.\nThe guy in the hardhat just stared, totally perplexed and unsure what to do.\nBefore that there was a gallery here, and it was small but brilliant.\nMuch like Madison!"
"I will keep this short and sweet since I've only been here for oil changes. They have great service and friendly staff. I've never run into a problem here. Yeah wait times can get a bit long for oil changes but for $15, I'll sit back and be patient. My son gets antsy at times, but lately he has the glass case of collectibles and neat items to look at which they've just added. \n\nWe've even left one vehicle and picked it up once it was finished. They are even open until midnight which might come in handy one day. They have complimentary water while waiting and even soda on some occasions. Available to you either indoor or outdoor seating while you wait. \n\nI'll be here every three months for my regularly scheduled oil changes. :)  thanks Sun Valley Auto!"
"Really.... I want to write a review, but Lauren V said all I wanted to say.\n\nI loved the light and mirror effect room.  I wasn't sure I would call it art, but it was cool as all cool.\n\nThe charred wood installation piece is fantastic to stare at...velvet rope and all.  I can't say I blamed the kid, I would have loved to run through it myself.\n\nThey seem to get some of the greatest traveling shows -- the Secrets of the Forbidden Palace, the Rembrandts, there was an impressionist one, Ansel Adams,Curves, the evening dresses, the Himilayan Art, Degas....\n\nIt's large enough that you can spend hours there, but broken up into sections so you don't feel you have to do it all.\n\nI hear they show movies there too!\n\nTuesday afternoon/evening = free!"
"Nice breakfast sandwiches such as ham, cheese, egg english muffins and a 16 oz coffee for $3 and some change.  $1 bbq pork sandwiches (I don't want to know what's in the meat at this time ... ignorance is bliss).  \n\nI like that the employees are always friendly, and this might be related to the fact that it's an employee owned cooperative.  \n\nAnd you can always count on a seldom played 80s and 90s song playing on the loudspeakers while you're pumping your gas.  \n\nTheir car washes are also really good and efficient.  And we stop here for milk on the go sometimes.  Fast and easy for my Sun Prairie existence.\n\nI'm docking them a star because unless you've been living under a rock, styrofoam cups are kind of not cool.  Switch to paper cups for hot beverages and I'll revisit the rating."
I got my hair done here today I had Claudia up for my hairstylist she was absolutely amazing I definitely recommend her she absolutely knows what she's doing I have blond hair and I have had a rough time finding someone that can do it right
"I love me some Jones market.  As there is a dearth of Russian/Eastern/Central European restaurants in Las Vegas, Jones is a life saver.  I miss my Polish food and Jones gets me through by stocking such favorites as Profi pasztet (Polish country style pate), Delicje (chocolate covered biscuit cookies filled with fruit), and Prince Polo (chocolate wafer bars).\n\nThe selection for Polish food is better at the Polish market (duh) but Jones is closer to my house and is gigantic. I think Jones is targeted more toward Russian/Balkan products but, that's fine by me, I love to buy it all.  Also, my boyfriend regularly cleans Jones out of their Serbian pickles, stuff he buys by the carload (they are the best ever).  If you're scared to try the typical groceries, you cannot go wrong with Milka and Kinder chocolate and their tons, TONS of delicious European beer.  Nuff said."
"ULTA has won my heart, completely. I shop here frequently and every time I do, I get excellent customer service and the workers actually want to satisfy my needs. \nI visited ULTA today to hopefully change my eyebrow powder into a darker color since I dyed my hair black the day before. (I had golden light brown hair for two years) unfortunately I couldn't find my receipt for the eyebrow powder I bought earlier this year. (I was actually lazy to raid my room looking for the receipt) So the worker was generous enough to do an exchange for a darker color. There was a slight price difference of $2.70 but that's not much, right? I was completely satisfied. \nI also bought a Dolce and Gabbana perfume for the winter since my old perfume has a more floral scent and the worker who showed me it was so sweet as well! I am currently in love with the perfume. Love this place!!"
"This review is long overdue.\n\nAs a new customer, I booked a special 2 hour facial + massage combo with Diana.  I enjoyed every minute of it!!!.  The massage was perfect in terms of intensity and areas covered.  The facial was even better!!! This may be a little bit too much info but she is thorough and great with extractions.  I felt like my facial was much better than the 90 minute ones I get (and pay 2x the price) back at home.\n\nI highly recommend this place! However, minus 1 star for the lack of professionalism to the front desk/management.  I happened to be sitting in the waiting room for 10 minutes or so and the entire time it was gossip central between the people at the front.  Very distracting and it made me wonder what they say about all their clients."
"It's small and crowded, but they've got a great selection of organic goodies. I don't hit them up as much for groceries, though, as I do for lunch and smoothies.\n\nMy favorite is the tofu dog. It's rare to find a good tofu dog in Charlotte, and somehow, it's just not the same to make it at home. They make a righteous faux hotdog at Berrybrook, and I make a trip across town to eat there pretty frequently.\n\nThey've also got excellent smoothies. I'm a fan of the berry flavor, but there's several options to choose from. \n\nYou sometimes have to wait a while at lunch, as it can get a little crowded. There's not a lot of space to eat in or outside, but I've had a few interesting conversations with people who've shared my front porch swing."
Great sandwiches
"Anna's is fantastic, and pretty much can alter anything you bring in.\nI have brought multiple pants there (dressy and jeans) and have never had an issue with the final result.  I have also had a few dresses and skirts done as well.  On top of that I brought my wedding dress in to be fitted. I bought my dress as a sample so it needed multiple alterations, as well things I wanted changed (taking off some beading) and they also did the bustle- which was difficult on the dress I had.\nI couldn't have been happier with everything they did! Although with specific employees some of the things I was saying was 'lost in translation' but usually one of the younger girls was around to clarify what I was wanting.\nI will always bring my items to Anna's"
"We had met some friends at Yellow Rose for trivia on wednesday night. It was packed and right away you are greeted with a popcorn machine, so go ahead and help yourself. It was busy but not too busy and loud where you could not hear the trivia questions. It took about two hrs to get through the game but it was fun stuff. A waitress or two were in training so I did not get a drink I ordered, but like I said, it was busy. I would go again but I hope that they decide not to have Musicals as a trivia category."
"I was surprised by the generous portions of lettuce with that came with my order of spring rolls.  Attentive and quick service.  Never had a problem flagging down one of the 4 servers on duty.  An all around good experience.  The first pho I've had in Vegas.  While not the best broth I've ever tasted, it wasn't disappointing."
"between 4 and 5 stars. the food is absolutely delicious, but then again, sea bass is hard to mess up :P the drinks weren't as impressive, but the food and dessert are so absolutely delicious, for the food alone this place doesn't deserve less than a 4 star. the prices weren't out of ordinary for a fine dining place like this. the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is, well, nothing's exactly out of expectation good either. Wish I could give it a 4.5-star."
Love this place. I've only gotten a pizza here a few times but I frequently get the Baconstix and Cinnastix. So good... Their bread is like crack. I've never had a bad order from here. The only downfalls: delivery minimum is $10 (my Stix are about $7... First world problems) and they aren't as cheap as their competitors.
Came here after an evening of checking out the Stratosphere and noticed this place while trying to find my way out. \n\nNot too bad Roxy's Diner.. Not too bad at all... I would recommend this spot if you are looking for a quick bite to eat. \n\nI went with the Philly steak sandwich and fries and I walked away full and happy. The price wasn't too bad either and service was fast and friendly.
"Hey it's cheap, conveniently located & funky.  Great little outdoor pool just like in leaving Las Vegas.   I've stayed here several times for trade shows at bigger more expensive hotels.  Your experience 100% depends on who you get in the rooms next to yours; considerate neighbors or noisy idiots.   Also check out the Super8 for great rates but....NO POOL!  HoJo's has a pool...."
"One of my favorite cafes in Madison.  Great for coffee, a quick sandwich, or wine/beer.  Decent place for working/studying, but the internet can be pretty slow if at capacity (often busy on the weekends), also has a bit of a limitation in terms of outlets.  Favorite thing is the wine tastings (Fridays or Saturdays) - more expensive than other tastings in Madison ($9-14), but great themes, bottles, and conversation."
"This has been my go to hardware/home improvement store since moving to this side of town 13 years ago. It is one of the older Lowes in the area but is well kept and clean. The staff  over the years has been consistently above average. I do prefer Lowes to Home Depot, not sure really why other than I usually receive good service at Lowes as opposed to other chains. And yes Lowes is one of the big box stores that help kill the mom and pop hardware stores, but at least they offer good prices and decent  service."
"""Small? Yes. Parking? Sucky. But Awesome!!!! I worked in a comic book store for 10 years next to this place and my pores sweat their great menu. Upon entering the location you will notice that it reminds you of a dentist office. Weird but true. \n\nOn a weekday you will be hard pressed to not find an open table. Fridays through Sunday, good luck. It is an intimate space that allows you to keep your swearing to a minimum (there may be a kid right behind you, and I mean RIGHT BEHIND YOU). \n\nThe food is your basic \""""kabob-style\"""" menu. But this is not fast food. Lamb and steak cooked precisely to your request, veggie apps. like baba and tabouli are as fresh as it gets. Rice is delicious!  Also beware of their salad dessing...you will become addicted too it!\n\nSmall, but diverse menu. Very good service. Great to take out and eat at home. \n\n...They now have a corking fee, but who cares? Bring you biggest bottle(s) of wine and indulge, after all it is BYOB!"""
"Went to their lunch buffet, was impressed by the selection of the salad bar, the only thing I wish they have is some soup. Pizzas really tasty & full of toppings, they do get their pizza line well stocked with decent choices! Only if they have more dessert pizzas. For the price it's well worth it, especially Vegas doesn't have a real pizza buffet, we have Cicis! They also have a dinner buffet on Tuesday for the same price! I'd say they need to have more advertisement to get more business 'cause a lot of people doen't seem to know about it."
"One word - Vodkatorium.\n\nThe vodka menu at this place is a force to be reckoned with!  And when they call it a vodkatorium, how do you pass up taking a peek into this posh-styled diner?  I suppose they have food, too.  I've only tried the mediterranian pasta, which was good, albeit a little greasy for a pasta.  But seriously, this place is about the vodka.  Hands down."
Yummy chicken and to-die-for waffles with all that buttery goodness. I had gone there with a few colleagues for lunch and though it took them time to seat us and we could not sit together the food more than made up for it.
"""Out of town family is visiting.  You don't know where to take them. \n\nThe Dish is by far the best option. It is Southern, home style, everyone will find something on the menu and the atmosphere is relaxed. \n\nI absolutely love their grilled cheese and tomato soup (best tomato soup besides Trader Joe's tomato and roasted red pepper). They also have really good quesadilla's (or \""""Mexican pizza\"""" as my brother in law calls it). Everyone loves their Cajun meatloaf. \nAnd, always, the deviled egg.\n\nThere is usually local art on the walls. There is outdoor seating.\n\nThey do have a breakfast (I think Saturday). HOLY CRAP it is fatty, but really delicious (there is some sort of hash brown casserole that is INSANE)\n\nI don't go here on a regular basis. I think I would easily gain 20 lbs if I did. If you are hankering home cooked food though- this is the place to go.\n\nI have noticed that the Dish has been a little inconsistent over the pass few years. I remember in 2005 it was ALWAYS GOOD. I guess that happens over time."""
"""Review is for the Lobby Bar only.\n\nDad's sister and BIL were in town for just one night.  We met them here for drinks and dinner later at The Gallery Restaurant (separate review)  Setting and atmosphere were perfect for catching up with family not seen in more than a year and for sharing pictures and stories.  We sat in the very comfy upholstered furniture near the fireplace rather than closer to the bar which was a bit more boisterous.\n\nCocktails were reasonably sized, not what I would describe as generous and, although I didn't see the bill, I would guess they were not inexpensive.\n\nService was prompt and friendly.  But they did ask to \""""hold\"""" a credit card at the bar until we closed our tab.  Always makes me nervous to have a credit card out of my sight for any length of time.\n\nIf you need a place for cocktails with the parents or in-laws or to impress a potential client, this could be a good option for you."""
"First of all, this place is dirt cheap - nothing is really over $5 - I felt like it was the 90s again!  (Sigh....)   They have delicious sandwiches - BLTs, grilled cheese, hot turkey, pulled pork.  Each sandwich also comes with two sides, such as fries, mashed potatoes, cole slaw or mac 'n' cheese.  The sides are good, but nothing spectacular.  Still, the service is great and the price is right."
I love Thai Basil! Their evil jungle noodle is super good! And I love that they actually make the food mild in request. Some other places seem to make it even hotter when you order mild but Thai Basil is spot on!
Been coming here for about 7 years now...I drive all the way from Henderson because the shop and staff are that good. Trustworthy in their quotes and thorough in their checks. If  you have a Toyota or Honda... this is the only place I'd go to.
"I've eaten here plenty of times and always happy with the quality of the meal. My favorite are there fries with al pastor! It comes with all the fixings like nachos but instead of chips they use French fries!!! Love the salsas available too, compliments any item perfectly! \nI like to order their shrimp burrito when I want a change of taste and it is scrumptious!!! Imagine jambalaya wrapped in a tortilla and there's your shrimp burrito.\n\nI haven't eaten here in awhile mainly because service there has been on a downward spiral, I ordered thru the drive thru and it took me roughly twenty minutes to get my food, I understand (and appreciate) thoroughly cooked food but that's a long wait for drive thru service maybe they should hire a couple more workers to speed up productivity.\n\nI gave this place 4 stars because I truly love the food and would recommend it to anyone, just have to make sure that they aren't in a hurry for their food"
"Came here for breakfast twice recently, once in October and also on Christmas day. Wasn't expecting this place to be packed on Christmas day but it was. Despite being packed we were seated quickly (party of four) and were able to get our order in fairly quickly as well. It came out maybe a few minutes later than it normally would have but this was to be expected on such a busy day. As usual the food was great and very well priced. If you're a fan of IHOP, you'll love this place even more."
"GREAT PLACE TO LIVE!  I just renewed my lease for many reasons. The place is nice gated community and quiet at night. Any maintaince issues gets resolved quickly. The office staff are fantastic! And like anywhere in NV we see some bugs, well I let the office know. And they took care of spraying quick, and haven't seen one since. Gym is 24hr which I love. And it safe around here."
"This is a great time for people of all ages, there are a ton of games, beer, and quality appetizers.  I can spend hours killing time here and enjoying myself.  They have a lot of great first person shooter arcade games that you can just keep playing and playing with the swipe of a card.  \n\nI always see a lot of business parties being held here, and I think that it is a nice choice.  Too many business outings are held in quiet fancy restaurants and it just gets boring sitting around talking about work over wine.  I would much rather come here and shoot some hoops with my co-workers.  The only downside is the dent that it puts in your wallet, there is a lot of entertainment and it is easy to get carried away."
"The absolute best Korean Cold Noddles in the world! Well, i haven't tried the worlds', but they got some mean cold noddles."
"""Done Once, Done Well\n\nA friend recommended me to Back to Basics.  He takes three vehicles here.  We own two cars officially classified in Arizona as \""""antiques.\""""  They love them.  Gary & crew have repaired things for me other places didn't get done right.  My pickup is in for a smog violation today.  They have made carb adjustments and are taking the truck to emissions testing to make sure their work is good.  They also have a reference list of other automotive pros; for example, mobile minor body work.\n\nThey are becoming my sole source of auto maintenance when I'm in town."""
"My maid's name was Yesenia - she was the most enjoyable person I could have asked for them to have sent to my home to clean it. I paid $230 for a 1 time deep clean, and she did everything I had asked for when I called yesterday.\n\nYesenia spent about 50 minutes on my kitchen, then about 30 minutes on my bathroom. Vacuumed my entire apartment, picked up stuff that was on the floor, made my bed, and dusted everything.\n\nI would definitely use their services again in a heartbeat."
I bought my bike here and it was a big investment but their customer service post purchase have made me feel really good about my purchase.\n\nFirst visit they fixed my bike for free since it was such a minor issue.\n\nSecond time I got a complete overhaul after I had rode my bike hard and put it away wet for a year. I paid I think like 70-80 bucks and they handed back a brand new bike.\n\nVery impressed
"I just want everyone to know that Back To Basic Automotive is the best Automotive shop you can take your vehicle too.  They are very, very honest and outstanding mechanics.  These group of guys really care about their customers and their prices.  I can call them first thing in the morning and if they can fix my truck right a way and if the can they will if they can they will be honest and tell me.  I just really trust them, and I respect them for that.  Most of all they do an amazing job and fix the vehicles at a low cost.  Great job Team.....YOUR THE BEST!!!"
"Came here to celebrate with my family and had a genuinely wonderful experience.  The views and service are spectacular and what you expect from a fine dining restaurant like this. Over all the food was very good, though some dishes were better than others. My family had all different cuts of fish and they were all prepared expertly. My scallops stuffed with crab were the only minor disappointment, and they were fine, just not exceptional, nor worth 38$! The prices are seriously up there, but within the realm of reason for most things. Definitely only a special occasion restaurant but still very good. Only thing I'd change today would be their music! Odd pan flute selections made me think I was in a yoga studio, not a restaurant. So strange!"
Great service through and through from valet service through house-cleaning all the way to check-out. Staff really go out of their way to greet you and make you feel welcomed. Good location.  Rooms are adequate.  Comfortable bedding and nice toiletries.  Some minor cons:  you have to pay for internet and it's wireless only; no pool.  Would stay again though.
Mulligans is Iceacholics spot every Wednesday nights. To be honest not the food come for every week but hanging out with the boys and two of the coolest bartenders EVER Heather and Ron. They do close the kitchen down early so by the time we get there too late. The inside really nothing much there couple bar games dartboard or boxing punching game. They do have karoake nights and comedy nights certain days of the week. Small bar nothing special but the people that work there make it special. SHOUT out too Heather and Ron. If your looking for little dive bar have some drinks with friends in the area. Great choice! =)))
Old Navy is great for affordable basics.  I'm a fan of their jeans and athletic clothing and you can't beat their flip flop sales.  For such a busy store customer service is good.  The dressing room staff is quick to get sizes for you if needed and the cashiers are always friendly.  Only complaint is much like Kohl's they force you to use your card to take advantage of some of the deals but I do like the convenience of returning on-line purchases to the store.
"My parents and I wandered in here after a Sunday afternoon of furniture shopping, having zero clue about the food or the prices. Luckily, we were pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh, healthy and delightfully affordable. I recommend the chicken lentil soup, though I thought the hummus was a bit too bland. My father raved about the Shawarma Salad (beef and lamb strips over mixed greens), and my mom loved the Rolled Chicken Salad Pita. Our neighboring diners had the falafel, which looked delicious. \n\nWhat I especially love is that Aladdin's is a great place for vegetarians and carnivores to eat together in harmony. I can't wait when my college friends come out here to visit. My only suggestion would be to spice up the interior a bit. It doesn't need to become a cheesy harem, but right now it looks like a generic Panera Bread."
"The best late night food in Pittsburgh. The food is good, it tends toward fried and salty but that's fine. Portions are ridiculous. I love mustard, and by far the best mustard I've ever had was here. The pizzas are done well in a brick oven. But even if you hate everything else, the beers alone are worth the trip."
"I grew up eating at Macayo's.  Birthdays, holiday's, any big event, my family went here.  They are always laid back and let you do what you want.  If your a loud group(which my family is) they will put you more away from people.  At 22 years old they let me color my picture and then we fold them up into paper planes and toss them around the room!\n\nIt is great.  Now that I'm old enough to drink, their drinks are amazingly strong!  Gotta lot a little extra Tequila for your Margarita!  Food is always the best and their fresh chips and salsa keep me coming back!  The staff can be a little......slow, but everything else makes up for that.\n\nPlus......they are located in the best shopping complex, so I work off all the food I ate by shopping."
"Wow!!! This is the BEST chicken I've had ever! The waffles are amazing. After telling some people abt the restaurant, everyone had a comment to say, but the combo is really good. You aren't mixing the waffles w/syrup and chicken; I mean realistically you can, but they taste so good individually that you you'll savor every bite! \n\nI'm going to bring the hubby here! So yummy!"
"It's obvious from the moment I walked in that this is a professional service shop. The facility is very clean and I've watched the staff treat their customers extremely courteously.\n\nI bought winter tires here and they've made swapping tires easy because they store my off-season tires on-site. I've also had oil changes and winter inspections for a couple of cars. Minor quibbles were addressed in a no-questions-asked, customer-is-always-right fashion.\n\nI trust Capitol Tire to always treat me with integrity and respect.\n\nNote: They are extremely busy so it pays to call ahead."
French onion soup... mmmmm. definitely a stop when i come back to the city..
"""Still very good authentic Thai food in Vegas....although I have a new favorite!\n\nMy friends love the \""""large\"""" thai teas...which are huge!  They have to be like 32oz of yummy or close to it....and cheap!  I think they were about $3!\n\nWe usually order pad ka pao and pad kee mao, as hot as they will make it.  The curry is also very good here, but not my fav Panang curry.\n\nThe location could use a refresher...showing it's age...and the location sucks...\n\nBut the food is why you come here!  And it will be worth the trip!"""
"""I started taking my 2002 Jetta TDI here a couple of years ago after moving to the west side.\n\nTheir work has consistently been better than my previous mechanic, they're quite good at working with multiple budgets (\""""This is a NECESSARY repair\"""" vs \""""This needs to be fixed in the next 6-12mo\"""" if you don't have a lot of money on hand, rather than adding unnecessary extras.\n\nThe online appointment system on their website, as well as ability to email and discuss problems instead of relying on phone tag has also been quite handy.\n\nThey came on the recommendation of two different friends, and I've since recommended them to a number of friends myself."""
"I was pleased to see the recent renovations at the Village Tavern. I have always been a fan of it's very good food and last night's dinner there was excellent. The shrimp and grits were possibly the best I've ever had and my husband loved the spinach chicken salad that he ordered. There was one very glaring problem, however. The new tables in the center of the room were extremely uncomfortable. I like to sit with one leg crossed over the other just above the knee. These tables made that impossible. They are made with leaves that can be folded out to create a larger table, but when they are folded in, there is not enough room for the average person to sit comfortably (and no, I'm not a large person - at all). I'm sure that the person who bought these tables never attempted to sit in one of them with the leaves folded up. What a shame. They should be replaced. So in the meantime, be sure to ask to be seated someplace other than these tables."
"Walking distance from the office. The breakfast (2 eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast, jalapeno, iced tead w/ lemon) $5.25. Lunch specials are all around $5. The view is nice with window seating. Orders are made to order, so it takes a few more minutes. The crowd is City of Phoenix employees ranging from lawyers to police officers. It's a place to eat modest priced home cooked feel food."
"Hotel was ok.  Clean and nice staff.  Breakfast was good.    Waffles, cereal, fruit, hard boiled eggs.  \n\nPool looked ok... With hot tub.   \n\nWish the bathroom was a little bigger and they need some sheer curtains."
"Very friendly service, clean, good food.  It was just a tad noisy but that's to be expected these days.  We will go back here."
"I've been here quite a few times.  I usually order the same thing, last time I branched out and tried a chicken and shrimp burrito.  It was ok but the real winner for me here is the mahi tacos, they're great!  It's disappointing though when you place a to go order and get no chips and salsa.  Thought that was a fluke the first time but they don't give them for to go orders.  Tacos are so good though it doesn't matter too much."
"I just wanted to say that everyone should get a Vanilla Lisa's Love Lotion.  Just go out right now and try it.  You won't regret it, and in fact, you'll probably thank me."
"This place is awesome! Salsa bar, beer, margaritas and authentic tasty Mexican food. This place has the best ceviche tostadas. EVER. Hand down. The machaca  burritos are amazing too. The carne asada tacos are just ok. Not taco truck status, but still yummy. The guac kind of ruined it for me."
"Went here after a post-Xmas and it was pretty good. The portions are huge and they have that old-timey feel inside. You feel like you are in Michigan or somewhere woodsy inside. I ordered the corn beef hash which was huge. They don't have hash browns but use these homemade potato chips instead. They are good, but I really wish I had more hash with my hash, if you get me. I tried the banana bread which was warm and delicious too, but very filling. The waitresses were so friendly and attentive. Shermaine was always on it for the coffee refills which is great. Nothing worse than cold or empty coffee.\n\nDefinitely a good local spot and one I would gladly come back to patronize."
"""If you're looking for political-themed, Steeler or gag gifts, this shop is a good place to check out.  I thought the non-birthday card selection was a little small, but I'm also really particular about my greeting cards.  Like many card/gift shops, this place carries some soaps and bath products, and those Quotable Quote mugs/magnets/cards.  There's also a small toy selection, which is handy if you need a last-minute gift for a child or just someone who's, as they say, \""""young at heart.\""""\n\nThe owners are very friendly, but don't hover, which I appreciate since I need time to soak in all the different products in the store.  I prefer the bigger card and gift selection at Kards Unlimited over on Walnut in Shadyside, but in terms of employee friendliness, this place wins and is definitely worth checking out if you're in Squirrel Hill."""
"Consistently good traditional Americanized Chinese food.  Take the hometown Chinese joint that most have an affinity for from their childhood, spruce it up a little, and what you end up with is Sesame Inn.\n\nOne of their several locations, Station Square is definitely the hardest to find, but don't let it fool you!  Relative to all the other food options in Station Square (sans Melting Pot (one of our favorite date spots - late night fondue!) and Texas de Brazil (which I haven't been to yet)), this represents your best bet for a quality meal unless you want to shoot for the Grand Concourse.\n\nStick with the General Tso's and you'll have a good meal that will satisfy your hunger.  The chicken actually looks and tastes like chicken and it's more than filling.  Sesame Inn's consistency transfers across all of their locations, which is a good thing to me."
"Pros:\n-Very clean\n-Awesomely comfortable beds with super fluffy pillows\n-Quiet (and we were there on a busy weekend with a home football game)\n-Starbucks in the lobby and in the hotel rooms\n-Was able to get a room on Priceline for $60 the day before we arrived\n-Free parking\n-Foursquare promotion = free breakfast buffet in the restaurant\n-Friendly, helpful staff\n-Not right downtown but easily a 5-10 min drive from the Capitol\n\nCons:\n-Like another reviewer said, the showerhead is very low - not great for tall guests\n-Some rooms face railroad tracks; we didn't hear any trains but not sure if this is disruptive at other times\n\n\nOverall, a great place. It seems like it's been recently updated and well-maintained. I'd recommend it to anyone traveling through Madison."
"Fantastic service! The prices are at or better than what you would expect to pay at any QUALITY dry cleaner. The dry cleaning, finishing, and tailoring are top notch! The staff is exceptional as well. We were pressed for time and needed something cleaned and pressed within a few hours and they bent over backwards and got it done... NO extra cost. SUPERB!"
"I've only stopped here for coffee, and they do it well.  The baked goods always look fabulous but, I stay away because they go right to my hips.\n\nA big wine selection, plus some  gifts.  Tables are a bit crowded together and it can be hard to find a place to sit when it's busy.  Excellent people watching!"
"Parking is never a problem; lines can be long but lots of teller windows open, and business banking line is quick.\n\nSpecial shout-out to Jennifer Bagget, who is absolutely lovely and helpful.  She took care of all of the business banking needs I had, always remembered me by name and all of the business account details, and was extremely responsive -- just terrific!"
"Everyone should really get the opportunity to experience Ian's pizza. It's work of art...to be devoured, likely at the darkest hour of the night.\n\nIf you're looking for traditional slices of pie, I'm sure you can find one or two here. But the real draw to Ian's are the creative concoctions. I think my new fav is the mac n' cheese pizza, which is their best selling slice, and for good reason. Loaded with cheese, this is your slice if you're from Wisconsin - or just a cheese lover. Other candidates for my hunger include the sausage penne alfredo, any of their BBQ slices, and the fajita. They also do monthly special creations such as the gyro or Chicago dog.\n\nEnough reading of my ramblings and go grab a slice. And eat one for me - I'm 971 miles away."
"My wife & I frequen this place. I live about 25 minutes away from this place but sometimes we are here 3 times a week. Our favorites are the luv-it special, western & banana split. My daughter likes the bumble berry. Sometimes I will order a pint of their frozen custard and usually it takes me longer to finish it than a regular half gallon of ice cream from the supermarket because it's very packed unlike store bought ice cream, which to me now is half air."
"Have to say I must of been crazy not to visit this place sooner in my life.\n\nWalked in the door and was just in awe of the atmosphere. Yes, it's just like its advertised...a Roman Catholic church turned restaurant/brewery. \n\nThe food we had was adequate. No over portion sizes for Lunch here. Prices were good. \n\nA trip to a brewery without tasting beer is just unAmerican...so we had a few samples. The IPA was hoppy as expected with the bite in the aftertaste quite brisk. \nWhat I found even better was the Cherry Quadzilla, a special beer they make, not always on tap but today it was. Has such great flavor, goes down smooth, cherry/Carmel taste with just a hint of bite. \nCould drink it all day, however with the higher than most alcohol content, I don't recommend too much if you have to drive! \n\nAll and all it was a great experience. The chocolate moose cake is good for an ending treat!! ( comes with 3 pieces of peanut brittle on the side). For me to say it was good means something because I don't even like chocolate cake!!\n\nWill definitely be going back again in the near future!!"
"Definitely love Jack in the Crack because its not to expensive., The Food and Shakes are made fresh. The desserts are tasty and they let you add stuff to your order at the menu without frowning. And if SOMEONE steals your cherry on your Strawberry SHAKE they will give you another one LOL."
Every time I have been here the associates are very welcoming & helpful. I bought a Christmas shirt for my pug. Needless to say his rolls on his neck hindered the shirt to fit without choking him lol  I went in today and had a hassle free exchange. Don't forget they sell CRICKETS.
"Went there for dinner. We had the egg rolls, Mongolian beef, and Generals chicken. Food was really good. The only negative thing I can say is that the egg rolls were a little on the greasy side and you don't get very many. Service was good. Decor is outdated but place was clean."
"How come people only give 3 stars to this place?\n\nTHEIR FOOD TASTES GREAT!!!!!!\n\nwe ate so much and we only pay $15 per person!\n\nthe hakau is realllllly good, the skin is perfect!!!\n\ni love their leek pork and shrimp dumpling, it's sooooo good.\n\nthe lomakai has shrimp and lapchiong inside, which is not what you find at other places.\n\nthe fried bread is sooo crispy and not too thick!"
"This is the place that rich people come to do all their shopping (I mean if i could afford to I might too).  This is an upscale specialty grocery store (I think it might be a chain, so if you think you have seen one somewhere else than you probably have) that has a great selection of prepared foods, deli items, seafood, and a large bulk nut, candy, and spice section.  The produce here is expensive and not the best in town, but everything else they offer is top quality.  Think of this a a larger, cheaper Dean and Deluca- the perfect place to pick up something to take to a cocktail or dinner party (the have a decent beer and wine selection)."
I got a flat on the side of the freeway.  This place had me up and running within 35 minutes.   They were honest and fair and very helpful I will definitely use these guys again.
My favorite place to take people. I've never had a bad meal. Most of the time I order 2 meals so I can have one later. Love their red sauce. Put that sh*t on EVERYTHING!!! Mmmmm
"Really good pad Thai, but can get expensive. I recommend going for their lunch specials other wise it can get expensive of you start ordering rice, chow mien, etc. the lunch chicken pad Thai and the chicken Thai salad are really good."
"Drew's is a really nice family restaurant. I'm surprised at the negative reviews. I've been here several times and the food and service has been consistently great. It costs about the same as Eat N Park but is considerably more upscale (especially compared to the horrible Eat N Park in nearby Edgewood). Compared to most similar places, I'd go here any day. \n\nTry the fried zucchini with horseradish sauce."
"I haven't been to a LaQuinta in a long time, but this stay just changed my mind on the brand.  The room was spacious and updated.  The bed and bedding was super comfortable.  GREAT value for the money.  Karen greeted up upon check in.  She was extremely kind and helpful.  She even helped us with where to park our RV.  We were nervous about where to stay the night to where our RV would be safe - LaQuinta was in a safe location, with a very well lit parking lot.  There was also a cute little courtyard to relax outside.  And free waffles, hard boiled eggs, toast/bagels, yogurt, juice and coffee.  I would certainly stay here again if I were passing thru the area.  I wouldn't necessarily stay if I were partying down in Vegas bc it is too far away and you can get cheap rooms on the strip.   We were needing to avoid the strip....we just needed somewhere to sleep on our way thru town and LaQuinta provided a great place for us."
"The Mrs and I rely on the morning smoothie for our small familial unit. Typically packed with greens and not so much on the sugar. Carolina Smoothies, where they have the appeal for the masses and maybe not SO much on the health side, what they do is great. \n\nThe availability of smoothies without sugar, fresh juices, replacements for any sort of dairy, and other healthy additives is a huge plus for this joint. If you're in the mood for a simple fruit smoothie and not a bunch of other junk added in, they will accommodate. My recent favorite is the Key Lime Cooler sans yogurt, extra banana, no agave or sugar added. Tart and refreshing. Great for a morning meal or post-workout. \n\nThe prices vary and the sizes are absurd. You're not going to find a ridiculous 465oz smoothie here, which I like. Also, they have tons of snack foods to choose from -- pretzels, nuts, bars, mixes, etc. \n\nI really like the community board in the back, too. Lots of local info on races, activities, etc. \n\nI'm a fan! Looking forward to becoming a more reliable regular. Viva Dilworth."
Love the food here. So far everything I've tried has been good. Inside the restaurant could use some improvement. Whenever I eat from here I take it home because I don't like the inside but the food is great.
Amazing experience! Jose went above and beyond any expectations I had prior to waking in. He was able to answer all questions and give advice on stuff I didn't even know I needed to know. He was able to provide samples at little or no cost to make sure I got what I needed. Highly recommended and will definitely be back!
"Oh so good.  Get their spinach vegan dish.  The spices are all there and it tastes heavenly.  And the bread and chutneys that come with the dishes are just great.  It's a bit pricey for what I would consider something I that I can easily eat in one sitting, but very very good."
"Have been going here for over four years. They've changed management since I started going but the core staff remains the same. Lisa is my go to gal for waxing and manicure. \n\nAloha is clean, they get the job done (my nails up to two weeks), have AWESOME pedicure chairs, offer complimentary wine (albeit a generic Chard or Cab Sauvignon) and bottled water, have a decent-sized flat-screen tv with no less than a thousand channels, and has a fun mix of customers (I've chatted up guys and gals of all ages and colors while getting my toes freshened up). \n\nMake no mistake - it is no Aveda or Modern or other high-end, high-brow, expensive place but it is cozy, cheap, and convenient. \n\nAloha!"
"These guys are always helpful when I go in.  I here to ask for Rob, but I have found everyone to be pretty decent."
Good food and nice service
"I really did like this place, the happy hour is a little on the short side, but how could you complain if its 545pm when you get there and the happy hour stops at 6pm and you are told by the waitress that as long as you order the frist round before 6 you can get the beers for 99 cents the whole time you spend there. I had the mesquite turkey sandwich and I was pleased with everything about this place. \nThis place is a must go to while in the Phoenix-North area, woodchips on the floor, pistols for the door handels and yummy bbq sauce, fair prices that won't break your wallet,  I walked out of there happy and full, I would love to go back and try the rest of the menu!!!!!"
"Came here on date, the ambiance was absolutely perfect. The lighting was nice and dim and there were candles on every table. There was smooth live music, the type that isn't annoying, the type that you can actually have a conversation with one another and not yell over the noise.  \n\nFood, was great. We had Seafood Fradiavolo and Shrimp Pesto. They were both delicious. I recommend the Fradiavolo! it was bomblicious. \n\nService... well, it wasn't terrible. The hostess, was a little uninviting and although we made eye contact she made no acknowledgement when we walked in. We later found out, she doubles up as a bit of a server, so I understood that she was busy. Still, there should be more people working to accommodate the traffic. Our waiter... hmm, a little negligent, but once he stopped by, he was very quick.\n\nOver all, I would come here again!"
"My wife got her water pump on her PT Cruiser fixed here. We shopped around and the prices here were competitive. The staff was nice. We got our car back a couple hours then initially anticipated, but all in all we were happy with Doctor Auto."
"AwwwwwwMAZING!!! I could eat a dozen on my own! So bomb! I'm not a vegan, and these donuts don't taste odd, weird, or hippie. Wish I had some right now! Definitely take the drive to china town because its so worth it! Make sure you bring cash, no debit machine. PS 1 dozen donut holes for a buck! Yummy!"
"I really like this place. I went for the first time last week and had a man do my pedicure and manicure. The place was clean, used clean, sterilized utensils (unlike so many places dirty places I've visited in the past). I had terrible cracks on my feet, and he (forgot his name) did a really great job on my feet and hands. They haven't chipped, and look so shiny and almost gel-like. The price was $35 for mani-pedi."
"For Madison, this is a good as it gets for cheap, genuine chinese food. The number of international students who flock to this place should be proof enough. Their mapo tofu with pork is very good, and so are their black bean sauce dishes. The calamari in black bean sauce is surprisingly tender and delicious for the price.  Their congee is consistently good and their soups aren't bad.  Before this place opened, there weren't any good chinese fast food places in Madison at all. \n\nBe forewarned, if you're the kind of person who's just looking for some orange chicken or kung pow, you'll probably be unimpressed. But if you're looking for real chinese fast-food, this is the place. \n\nI have fond memories of this place. I live in California now and I'm surprised that I have yet to find a cheap chinese place here quite as good as this."
"Authentic, perhaps not, yummy?- you bet!  \n\nFamous Dave's is a little hokey, a little fakey, but still...the Dave's Ultimate Burger with bacon and chopped pork on top of an enormous burger is literally to die for!  My personal fave is the Georgia chopped pork- as a platter it's a whole pile of food for ten bucks.  the Mr. really loves the bread pudding on the rare occasion we order dessert!"
This is one of my go to places for any kitchen or cooking supply needs. I've bought a lot of basic things here from sauce pans to a few knives. They carry Victorinox knives which have found their way into heavy use and I've had to buy more for family members who fell in love with them. (They don't carry Global or especially Kyocera ceramics though which is like a deity created a knife and gave it as a gift to mankind). But if you need pizza pans to tongs to bartending supplies they can and do have what you need. Service is also very good here even if you don't have an account. \n\nI keep coming back here because in terms of selection and sheer volume of inventory they are hard to beat. They are bigger than the supply place in Henderson and even Clark County Restaurant Supply and they are very competitive on price.
"My favorite Dominos location! I've ordered several times, both delivery and carryout, and I've been pleased with every order.\n\nI've carried out at different locations such as the one on Simmons and Lake Mead in North Las Vegas (don't go there.. they make their food so sloppily) and no one is as good as them.\n\nMy favorites there are the mango habanero wings, chicken alfredo bread bowl, lava cakes, (OMG yummmmmmy) and their hand tossed pizza with chicken and bacon. \n\nI seriously eat there every week. I'm going to blow up, but I'll blow up satisfied haha!"
Cheap but tasty.  Nothing beats that combo.
"king of organic eats. seriously, i love coming here even just for the relaxed type of countryside vibe. i don't know if it's because folks that shop here are healthy, but people aren't in a hurry, or running you over with a cart, or even irritated with life. \n\ni like their shelve gourmet cheeses. they have a section for just health bars. now i know where to go for cheap bars should i pack for a hiking trip. i could spend an hour here just cruising up and down each isle with my mini cart.  the workers are friendly and genuine."
"Overall, a great place to hang out.  The chips were a little stale but the corn salsa had large chunks of tomato which made it extra special.  The Tavarua Wahoo Tacos were very tasty and had just the right amount of heat.  We sat on the veranda since it was a nice evening.  The service was great - constantly checking on us.  The noise level inside was on the higher side.  The Nectar of the Gods margarita went down very fast.  My only disappointment was that they don't serve any Johnny Walker!!!"
Love that it's open 24 hours perfect for when we're craving donuts which Is often. I feel that if I wasn't allergic to milk we'd be coming here more often
"The selection is incredible - I've yet to leave empty-handed, no matter how esoteric my search.  They cram an unbelievable amount of inventory into a very small space, so the layout of the store takes some getting used to.  Pricing is reasonable, slightly more than on-line sources, but a good value considering the expertise of the staff.  They also have a decent selection of kitchen gadgets, though not to the level of Orange Tree Imports or the Kitchen Gallery.\n\nWhile the staff members are not over-the-top friendly, they are incredibly knowledgeable.  I also like the fact that they will let my daughter and I browse freely when we have the time to explore.  The store also offers a variety of baking and cake decorating classes for all skill levels.\n\nFinding a parking spot in front of the store is a breeze, but navigating the congested Odana Road corridor to get to the store - not so much fun.\n\nIf you are in need of baking supplies, I encourage you to check out the Vanilla Bean."
This is my neighborhood sushi restaurant. I can't say enough good things about this place. Nowhere else in Charlotte you can get single pieces of tuna or salmon for $1 each. They are fresh and so big i can't even see the rice underneath it. Nobody can beat their $3 martini special during the week.\n\nGo see Allison at the bar. She is very sweet and will take good care of you.
"There may be other breakfast places that are more unique, have better individual menu items, or are more compelling for one reason or another. But over the years, this place has consistently provided great healthy meals and excellent, fast, friendly service. I have never had a bad experience here and have always left wondering why I don't come back here more often. Then I go and try some new trendy breakfast joint, only to realize I would have been better off coming back to First Watch instead. My personal favorite dish is the Chickichanga, but I've eaten half the stuff on the menu and it's all been really good. And I particularly enjoy the fact that no matter what I eat there, I never feel like I just ingested 9lbs of cheese and grease when I'm done. It's all light and healthy and fantastic."
I am new to the area and desperately needed my hair cut and highlighted. I found a groupon for this hair studio and thought I would try it out! I read reviews on yelp and it seemed promising. I received THE BEST cut and highlights EVER! Julie Naggs was my dresser. She is so creative and really listened to what I wanted. I showed her a picture of what I liked and she made it happen perfectly! I feel I look even BETTER than the model! I could'nt be more happy and I will keep recommending this salon and stylist to my friends.
"Great service!\n\nWent in for some brakes and the guy told me I could get them cheaper elsewhere.  Sorry Mr. Helpful Bikeshop Owner, but you're getting my business whether you like it or not! ;)"
"seriously above excellent for a starbucks.\nNow i have to admit, I used to work for s bucks back in chicago and the guy who hired me is now the DM for starbucks in Wisconsin.  His office is upstairs in this fine establishment.\nHe was a seriously fine manager who knows how to treat his employees, and kept high high standards.  So I am not surprised that this location just feels different than any other starbucks I have been to.\nWhevever I am passing through, I try to stop and see if he is in.\nHe usually isn't, but perhaps I should call first!\nSo, Malcolm, if you are reading this:  LOCK AND LOAD!"
"India Garden is a great go-to for lunch buffet or late-night food.  The selection is wide, the food is delicious, and the price is nice (but much better during the half off periods.)\n\nThe service is pretty mediocre at best, but to be honest I didn't expect much.  They're slow, generally unfriendly, and my water goes unfilled a lot. It wasn't always that way, but oh well.  The atmosphere is pretty enjoyable, in my opinion.  I like having late night food and drinks while Bollywood music videos blare in the background.  It makes for a loud restaurant, but when you're partying late at night, you're not looking for a quiet place.\n\nOverall, this is a good place for Indian food.  The selection is great, with tons of things on the menu (almost 100 or more I think).  It's definitely not the best Indian food in the Burgh, but the portions and prices let you share a bunch of dishes around, resulting in what I'd consider a true Indian dining experience.  I'd recommend late night after 10, when the food goes half-price."
"This is the place I take everyone that visits me from out of town. It's delicious for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and it's cheap, so price is never an issue. \n\nThe burgers are great, the breakfasts are delicious, but that's not the reason I'm here so often.\n\nThe real reason is the Chocolate Egg Creams. \n\nFor those of you that aren't familiar, the chocolate egg cream, originating in New York (as far as I've heard), contains milk (not cream), chocolate syrup, and seltzer. That's right, no egg. The egg creams at Courier are delicious, however, you should all know, they are NOT authentic egg creams as they contain egg whites to help the top foam up. \n\nAt any rate, very few places these days have egg creams, so it's great that this place still does. (But if nowhere near you has them and you want to try, they're way easy to make. My version: Fill a glass 1/3 with milk, add syrup til liquid height is 1/2 up the class, fill the rest of the way with seltzer, stir, taste, add more syrup if you wish!)"
We've used John Fish jewelers several times now and have always been impressed with the quality of materials and service.  Not the fanciest location in town...but do you really want to pay for _that_?  What you will get is fine craftsmanship and honest service.  These guys have been in town since the 70's and it's easy to see why...they are a great no-nonsense shop.
Located in a shopping center near the Deja Vu emporium. This store has all the typical dancer and cocktail waitress outfits as well as overpriced rhinestone jewelry and a decent selection of shoes/boots. The real find here is the outfit making shop located within that can custom make outfits from a variety of fabrics. They were able to ruche the butt of an ill-fitting Victoria Secret swimsuit bottom for me for only $6. Now my butt looks fantastic in this suit! Thank you. And they have pink robes in the dressing rooms if you are modest.
Excellent LARGE subs! Greek owned. TIGHT parking. Rough neighborhood. Divey.
"""Yes, their Oktoberfest is, by far, one of the best outdoor celebrations in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut if it is sadly not September, there is still a reason to cross the river to the North Side. It is called happy hour. \n\nHonestly, things were better before the new drink tax--somehow, a 10 percent tax resulted in nearly a 17 percent price increase. But, regardless, I can't stop going. Every Monday - Thursday, from 5 - 7PM, there are specials. \n\nWhile the website still says that you can get at 22 oz. Penn Weizen on Wednesdays (\""""Weizen Wednesday!\""""), the last time we were there, we were charged $3.50. \n\nIf you're not looking to spend a lot of money, but still want something to eat, an order of Goulash and a side of bread is enough to feed at least three people. Think of it as a gourmet chips and dip. \n\nPerhaps the best part, however, is the entertainment. Where else can you watch grown men in lederhosen play music and sing while you drink a huge beer?\n\nUntil I came here, I thought beer chants were something from the Man Show."""
"I've been to this place about three times now, and it's always been good.  The staff are pretty friendly, even telling us the history of the bar and it's past as a hotel.  They make a mean burger and their Saturday Prime Rib is pretty darn good given the price.  The marinated steak however is more like dried out chuck roast.  I won't be getting that again.\nOverall though, it's a place I will enjoy going to again.  It's earned it's atmosphere, and after 87 years, it's earned it's spot as a landmark.\nP.S.  One more thing, we found out that if you want the Prime Rib on Saturdays, you'd better get there early, or call ahead and reserve your cut."
"The best place for quick, easy and affordable shopping. I really appreciate the staff and there cheerful attitudes and helpful information. I also love all the cheap little goodies they entice you with, while you wait in line. I'm glad I do not have kids, or I'd probably hate them for putting these irresistible little bits of useless trinkets and prizes out there. I use them for summer flip flops, Fourth of July t shirts and beach/camping water toys. I also wind up getting pajamas for myself and as gifts. They're great."
"When my man and I are in the mood for Chinese take-out, we call up Food Express and drive over since they don't do take out. It's so worth it, more than the luxury of delivery. Movie nights would be complete if they would.\n\nI urge you to try the jellyfish appetizer! spiced and slightly pickled, its REAL GOOD.\nOur other favorite is the Honey Shrimp. It's like candy.\nThe only thing we didn't like so far was the Duck tongue in xo sauce. The bone inside made it really awkward to eat.\n\nSo glad to find knockout Chinese in vegas. SCORE."
The best Cuban food you can get in this town. Very home style. The chicken tends to be a little dry at times but over all the food is good. Their Black bean stew or habichuelas guisado (IS NOT A SOUP Mark W.) is delish and their yucca mojo is yummy.
"I enjoy taking my girlfriend and her daughter to this place at least once a month for hibachi. The chef's put on a great show for kids and the hibachi is excellent. Every meal comes with Soup, Salad, and Desert. So you Will be very full when you leave. The Steak and Shrimp are my two favorites. My only complaint is that the place is very dirty. The Bathrooms are right by the kitchen and both could use a good cleaning."
"""Thankfully, Barbs is in  walking distance to my house. This is a great place for your hangover cure, and your wallet will say  \""""thank you sir/mam may I have another\"""" as it is DIRT CHEAP.\n\nBarbs does breakfast, and they do it well, catering to the hearty working class Pittsburgh appetite.  They have a wide selection of Omelets, and you can order biscuits and gravy on the side (my go to fat kid breakfast item).\n\nThe waitress is spot on with coffee and anything else you may need. \n\nEverything was just what the doctor ordered, well, maybe not since I put hot sauce and mayo on everything, but thats another story. Unpretentious, filling, cheap, hearty, delicious."""
"This place is a LV landmark. Everyone should try it. Period.\n\nNow the details...\n\nYes, it is in a shady neighborhood close to the Stratosphere, but SO worth it.\n\nThe have weird hours ( I think they are closed Mon & Tues or something)...and they are CASH ONLY! I never carry cash, so this is a big deal for me.\n\nThe custard? AWESOME. Not alot of flavor selections, but awesome anyway.\n\nI recommend the Western Sundae."
"Marigold was my favorite spot for lunch in Madison for more than a year, and I miss it, especially the salads.   This is definitely not a secret spot - it's packed because it's so good!  Sometimes there's not even a chair to sit in while you wait for your take-out order.  On a cold day, order soup. On a nice day, eat outside!"
I use these guys when I stay on this side of town; love the quick turnaround.  Staff if very polite and do their very best to let you leave happy;  the last time I was there I hadn't been in for at least a month and they not only remembered who I was by name but were able to pull me up in the system without asking for my phone number; \n\nAs far as this type of business is concerned they are top notch and so are there employees; I will use them every time I'm on this side of town and thank you for your hard work and dedication in making me look so good!
"""Fast Forward\n\nEvery trip from NYC to Pitt includes a visit to Aiello's. And if we know anyone driving East, we request a transfer!\n\nIf you are in search of fancy \""""gourmet\"""" pizza, go elsewhere.\n\nAt Aiello's, you order the pizza you specify - and it is absolutely perfect!"""
"I found this place when I first moved here and was staying with a relative on this side of town. Now even though i moved out of the area, I come back because I love my nail technician Phil.  (No, there is never any confusion when calling in for an appt and they think I want a fill LOL!). \n\nThis place has the best prices for the service you get.  They always offer you a cold drink and friendly service. \n\nPhil does gel polish and manicures on my hands and regular polish and pedis on my feet. He is friendly and fun to talk to while he works.  We almost have a love/hate relationship as he is sarcastic and playful just like me, and we banter back and forth. \n\nThe only thing I don't like is I haven't found a chic in the shop that can do a good design on my toe after Phil is done, and he self admits that he has no skills in this area. \n\nIf possible try to come in on Tues-Thur, because weekends are super busy!\n\nEither way, I will continue to drive across town for this place."
"Great bar food, friendly staff, and good drinks. Their food is generally a generous portion for a great price.\n\nHappy hour is fair but not that great.  Good place to stop by for a quick meal."
"Thank goodness for no smoking laws!  Now I can go into Char's without having an asthma attack!  Overall, a fun place."
"If you love big plates of food in a kitschy ambiance, Omelet Place is definitely your place. There are so many different types of omelets that I was stuck. I told the waitress that I was debating between the lobster omelet and the chile verde omelet. Her decision, let the coin decide! *LOL* So I ended up with a chile verde omelet.http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/9oejaQafFch7vjEiHoCQ4g/l Very good. I could only eat a few bites because I ordered some pumpkin bread with my meal. That bread was piping hot and so flavorful. Hubby had the country fried steak. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/B4JKIvsJHlQu-uVp165kYQ/l  He liked it. It wasn't the most fantastic CFS that he's ever had, but he said it was good.\n\nThe staff was extremely nice and the price was just right. It's in North Las Vegas but not that far from the strip. \n\nThe other cool thing that they offer is a mini-omelet. It's cheaper too. I totally forgot though."
"I got an avocado smoothie with aloe jelly. It probably sounds more healthy than it actually is, but it was so delicious!"
The pizza was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but I wouldn't expect much else from an Oakland pizza place. I would still go back. They did have some student special that I think was $8 for a large one topping pizza.
"I looked around at some animal hospitals around my area and these guys seemed to be pretty well established and have a decent following. I called them up, scheduled the appt and dropped him off early Saturday morning for his surgery. The staff were all very friendly and the office was clean. I was able to print and fill out the 'first visit' forms from their website so that helped with check in time. All in all a good experience. I will continue to trust them with my dog"
"""This place is good. Really good, actually. It's sort of hard to find, tucked away in some pseudo-industrial officeplex on E Patrick (just west of Del Sol, on the north side of the street). You can definitely tell it's a locally owned and operated kinda place. It would get five stars, but my corned beef sandwich was, though completely satisfactory, not stellar. My friend's meatball sub, however, WAS stellar. So get that. They make their meatballs fresh by hand. In fact, the owner is the one who made our sandwiches. Nice guy, in an east coat deli proprietor sorta way. Really, they deserve five stars just for the \""""no students in the bathroom\"""" signs on the bathroom doors. Pretty damn funny if you ask me. Definitely worth checking out for a quick lunch, especially on your way to or from McCarran. As far as delis in Las Vegas go, you're really not gonna do any better. And that's not a bad thing."""
"The place is small with a low ceiling. It's in the basement of an old Italian neighborhood social club. It's crowded and noisy for a reason. People like it. We waited 10 minutes for a table. They gave two of us a four-top. On a Friday night at 6:00 there were at least four families with kids at the table. People knew each other. Nice neighborhood feel. It was packed when we left.\n\nUnassuming and authentic Italian. Spousal Unit and I shared a meat antipasto, Sicilian salad and a large pizza. Quality stuff. The prosciutto, salamis and cheeses were excellent,  the salad OK and the pizza was great (anchovy and roasted red peppers). The house Sangiovese was delicious, I had two. The service was fine, even with the crowd and the noise. \n\nThe menu claims that all the meats come from a local farm (that's good). All the deserts are homemade so a return to try those is in the cards. There was also a smoked salmon pasta on the menu that I might have to come back to try. Good stuff."
"What's not to love about CM.  You got novelty items to look through, great beer and a deli that always looks fantastic even though I've literally never tried it.  This location with it's new outdoor patio out front really has a following it seems.  We stopped in just the other day on a weekday and the place was packed.\n\nBe aware the parking out front is weird and you basically have to back into a parking spot.  Strange and awkward.  \n\nI come here for the beer selection, that's the main reason.  They always have good taps on deck and the bottle selection is equally impressive."
"New cat from the animal shelter and we could get a free check up at VCA hospitals.  I dropped in with the new one, Haule, and had a check up.  I had been told he was about five months old, but the Vet told me he was a little bit younger based on his teeth.  \n\nHe was in good health and they encouraged a booster vaccine, free as well, in two weeks.  So I knew I would be back.  There are no appointments, just walk in, their hours are long and seven days a week including Sunday's.  The staff were friendly and prompt.  I have used the VCA hospital system in Hawaii after my Vet retired and he recommended it, but when we moved to Las Vegas, I went to a couple of different animal hospitals.  I am very fond of Durango Animal clinic, but VCA on Spring Mountian is an excellent backup!"
"This review is based solely off their wings and buffalo chicken sandwich. Some of the best in town. For those that have been to DD Peckers, these sauces are nearly identical. The ambiance may be lacking but the chicken is packing."
"Not only great customer service, but my car came out looking amazing. Like its never been in the accident. They even washed my car inside and out. Lily, the girl up front is amazing, she kept me updated on everything, everyday. Never kept me waiting and was always there to answer all of my questions. Lily, you are amazing:)"
The bagels and sandwich we had were good.  The menu was a little confusing. The service was quick and the prices were reasonable.
"Always VERY good never great. I would still go 4.2 stars:) The highlights being the phlliy cheesteak as far as the sandwiches are concerned. But the devil is in the details, i.e. the WISE brand chips they carry, specifically the sea salt and vinegar ones!"
"""This is our second stay on the Governor's Club and I just love it!  Funny I got a better price on line than when I called with my card number - but whatever.  The Club is great if you don't feel like bar hopping.  We go in from Chicago late on Friday and it was super cold.  It was nice to go into the Club have a few cocktails - meet someother travelers.  We also enjoyed the breakfast in the mornings.  The only thing that is a little tacky is that they close at 10:30 - instead of closing or flashing the lights - someone yells \""""closed!!\"""" or something to that effect.  Sort of abrupt and unnerving - we spent th last hour relaxing and then to get yelled at is a little annoying.  We will definately be back however.  Very convenient location.   Super comfortable beds."""
"My father has been going here since I was a little girl, so in 2006 when I got my first car which is a Honda, I naturally started to come here. \n\nService has always been top notch. Friendly, polite, and the fact they have complimentary rides to and from the place is great. My car has always come out of this place great.\n\nThey've always been super fast with repairs, even when it has been a major service. One time they knew I had to leave for Arizona the next morning and the mechanics stayed until 8:30, fixing my car when they normally close at 5:30. \n\nTop notch place.\n\nAdded 1/21/13 --\nI should have done this a long time ago, but last year I nearly totaled my car. The engine was completely smashed on one side, couldn't get the doors open/closed, and the hood wouldn't go back down. The third call (First being my dad, second being my insurance company) was to Wally. A few weeks later, I got my baby back in amazing condition. Forever thankful."
"When you are ready to judge a south of the boarder restaurant by the food vs. the price and quantity this is a good destination for dinner. The cammorones a la diabla is hot but not too hot that you loose the flavors (and your taste buds). Some good ice cold Central American beers at $3.50 goes great with the food. For those of you or your guests that prefer some thing alcohol free try the pineapple Jarritos y Sangria. There plantains, both sweat and not sweat, are a step from the average. \nTry their lunch specials posted on a white board, straight in front of you as you enter. They are all excellent. My favorite is their sopa, a bowl of broth filled with huge pieces of meat and vegetables. Sorry for the locals but they do not serve iced tea."
I have never been disappointed with this sushi Restaraunt for the past 15 years and I think there food is as good or better that any hotel for half the price. It's only 5 min from the strip and make sure you go to this one its the original location and far better than the other ones.
"Choke parking, cheap monthly, great staff. I usually go later in the evening when less crowded but the machines are always clean and and always some one in the check in area when you need assistance with something. The locker rooms are also clean so thats another big plus. Def a gym I would recommend for friends that come to town visiting and need a gym to work out at."
Really excellent food for its price.....Recommend if you are not caring too much on the environment.
"It was good and tasted fresh, tiny place that doesn't care about looks but cares deeply about making some good ass custard. I had some concoction of strawberries and salted pecans and it was damn good with butter pecan custard was very tasty. its a must stop if you are in the area."
Great people.
"went with a group.\nhad a good table in a private room; had some apetizers, oysters, shrimp coctail, crab cake.\nthe crab cake was not good, other appetizers were good.\nhad the t-bone 24 oz steak it was very good although it was more rare than a medium should be.\n\nall in all, it was good but very pricy."
"Food very good ,place very clean"
"I do dig me a nice pair of Pumas. And I'm starting to get into the apparel side as well. Something about it brings me back to childhood.\n\nAs for the store, I was super pumped to find that everything there was 50% off. Dunno if this is just a pre-Christmas thing, but it sounds like it may be more the rule than the exception. So I shopped like a bawse, but alas, the one pair I had my heart set on was sold out in my size. \n\nOne thing that did bother me a bit is that the aisles here are packed so tightly together you're constantly stepping over someone to grab what you're after. And then there isn't really a whole lot of real estate dedicated to sitting down to try on your shoes.\n\nLots of apparel up front. Most of it is pretty simple, and not wildly unaffordable. At full price it was a little spendy, but with the half-off you can score some deals. Not crazy cray crazy deals, but solid deals."
By far the best nursery is Vegas for selection. They carry a lot of things that the other nurseries and home improvement stores don't. They also have the largest selection of Monrovia plants in town as well. \n\nEvery time I go in there they will have something new in stock to buy and plant. \n\nThey also have a large exotic bird population onsite which is great fun for kids. I love watching the shocked look the little kids get when they get pooped on by a bird.\n\nThe only cons is that they don't advertise their specials and they don't have their inventory online. If they did that then they would be 5 star all the way.
"This is Pittsburgh.\n\nI'd also like to settle the debate about which Incline is better. It's this one. For locals, this is great transportation up to Mount Washington and all the restaurants up there. For out-of-towners, the view from the Duquesne Incline surpasses the view from the Monongahela Incline. \n\n***Tip for passengers waiting for a connection in Pittsburgh for more than a few hours. Take the 28X bus towards downtown and get off at the base of the incline (the stop's right there, but ask the driver!). Take the incline up, eat and drink something, take the incline down, get back on the 28X and back to the airport. The whole thing can be done in about 3 hours, eat/drink time included, if you're smart."
"For what they do, they do it really well.  Great eat n run kind of place.  Parking can be a challenge, but it's not the size of their lot, it's the quantity of people heading there for a midday meal.\n\nTheir claim to fame is their rotisserie chicken - they serve it in a variety of ways...... in a tortilla with rice and beans, over a salad, smothered in queso, with mayo in a chicken salad, etc.  I haven't had a bad chicken dish yet.  Portions are on the above-avg side.\n\nThey also have daily specials......CPP on Wednesdays is a solid choice, but my go-to special is the Meatloaf on Fridays.\n\nProbably my favorite part of their menu is their side dishes.....squash casserole, mashed sweet potatoes, black beans, garlicky new potatoes, etc.  You can just order the veggie plate and walk out extremely satisfied.\n\nService is fast.....order at the counter, then they call your name to pick it up in a few minutes (sometimes your order is up before you finish paying).  \n\nNothing fancy about the decor, but it works."
Simple sweet little course. Expansive views of the LV Strip.
"We dropped our truck here when we moved from West Virginia, had storage here for two weeks, and rented a truck to move our stuff from storage to our new home, and our experiences were all great. The staff is friendly and helpful, and they're willing to work with you. \n\nDue to car issues, we kept having to push back our truck pick-up time, and they were more than willing to be flexible with us. They also allowed us to park our still-packed truck in their parking lot after we dropped off our tow-dolly so that we wouldn't have to drive the truck back to our hotel before we could unload into storage.\n\nDefinitely would work with these guys again whenever we need to rent a truck."
"Finally found my favorite dry cleaning store in town.  Price is reasonable, and service is far better than more pricey ones.  They don't ship your clothes to other warehouses.  All the cleaning is done within the store, so it's faster and adds more personal touch.  There are several mom and pops around town, but this one seems to run independently (Lake Mead and Buffalo location).  Love them!"
"I haven't found many pho places out in Charlotte but was glad to find this spot. It's pretty dang good. I had the Pho Tai and grubbed it down.\n\nWhat I appreciate at pho places is when they portion it out perfectly.  In most pho places in LA, they tend to give you way too much and it is nice and all, but you miss out on the satisfaction of finishing off a bowl - I thought this amount was really good.\n\nThe service was just fine and the food was awesome. I hope to come back again soon.  Doesn't hurt that there's an Oriental Market nea\n\nThey must be servin' up some lamb too because I saw a RACK and a half.\n\ndmo out."
"You think they only serve boba drinks and tea here? Wrong! They have a pretty big menu including snacks like fried taro balls- delicious!!! (We love taro! If you're a fan, you should try it.), spring rolls, and soup. I like the mango hot tea, just enough sweetness. I'm a big fan of fruit teas as well as green tea. Large selection of drinks here- hot and cold. Perfect place for dessert.\n\nBut if you're trying to have a conversation on a weekend night, it can be a little hard to do that since this is a social kind of place where games are played, like cards (iem noisy) and there is a lot of smoking (not a smoker so this bothers me and sometimes my allergies don't like it either).  Service is good but it's not like they're smiling and happy about being there. At times it can be hard to get a seat on the weekends. If parking is a problem, just park in the back."
"Not sure if being the Duke here is good or not, but it's open 24/7 so it gets 4 stars from me. Good late night spot close to home to grab some needed grease when necessary. Drive through moves fast and it's in a safe location. Love me some nuggets!"
Very reasonably priced and good service. The place didn't have the cleanest methods but the service and quality were good so i might just bring my own equipment and go back.
"Best Italian in Madison.  Ignore the hater reviews.  Get a reservation if it's a weekend.  Best advice is dine at the bar.  Pizzas  are excellent, calamari and Caesar salad solid.  Top 1% martinis.  Always ask about the specials."
Older gym but still better than the one in my town.  I was in town and wanted to try out the Zumba class with Erikita and it was great.  She is very cardio oriented and I left a sweaty mess.  Parking is easy and there was no need to sign up for the class.
"Amazing place. I'm often too hungry to be patient here, but am never disappointed.\nKnowing how good the food is, it's VERY hard to be patient... And some days we've had to wait about 20 minutes for our food. But it was well worth it, I think. Have never been able to finish an order from here (portions are VERY generous)... Great leftovers! Their pasta is amazing and their pizza is one of the best in town.\n\nI've only dined in, never carried out. The dining room isn't huge, but you won't feel like you're suffocating. The lighting is a little dim, and they often have Dean Martin playing in the background. Flat screens at every corner, I believe-- you'll never miss a game or breaking news! Ha!\n\nThe service is almost always good. The servers are always very nice.\n\nFirst time writing a review for this place (and in general), but I will be sure to add any more info if necessary.\n\nDefinitely a place to go, any time of the week! You won't regret it!"
"Relaxed, classy, and not at all what someone would expect from an adult toy store. The staff is extremely friendly, and knowledgeable about sexual health. They have a wide variety of merchandise, all at very fair prices. I believe the owners breed Newfoundlands, so imagine my delight when a big furry dog came out to give me some love while I was shopping.\n\nDefinitely go here for all your sex-shop needs. 5/5"
"Went in for an oil change - they provided very straight forward, quick, dependable service. They greeted me as soon as I pulled up. I had a headlight out, which they checked with me before replacing. There were 3 people ahead of me, and I was in-and-out in about 40 minutes. The price was a little more than I had hoped, but well worth it for honest personnel and quick service."
"The atmosphere is unique with low ceilings and Christmas lights strung everywhere -- good if you're not claustrophobic. It can get pretty loud, but the drinks were good and the pizza, along w/ paisans, is my favorite in madison.  The antipasta platter was great, although it did have a cold fettucini salad on it. I'm not an expert, but I thought an antipasta should be, well absent of pasta.  It gets crowded fast, parking can be hard to find,  and they don't take reservations. I've wanted to go back again and as soon as I'm able to get a table I will."
"I don't really care for the cones here, but I do adore the birthday cake ice cream. It is the best I have ever had! Instead of the typical yellow cake, there is chocolate cake swirled in! Ginger is pretty tasty as well. The berry crumble was too sweet and was a disappointment."
"I have been ordering here since I was little. Their Generl Tso's is my favorite. Other favorites: pork fried egg roll, fried won ton and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. The lunch prices are awesome. The dinner is more expensive but the same portion as lunch - so try to get there during lunch hours. My only complaint is that they do not deliver."
"Love Sammy's. This was my first time at this location and the first time at Sammy's for lunch. It was very crowded, but I didn't have to wait. I had the chicken chopped which was delicious as always. I couldn't eat 1/2 of it because there was so much. One person with us had a pizza. I don't remember which one, but it was tasty. I usually have the BBQ pizza which is GREAT. Another friend had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was delicious. I'm not so sure about the grits. The texture was more like polenta.  If it really is polenta, they should call it Shrimp and Polenta. If they really are using grits, they definitely need to find a better way to cook them. Overall though, it was a good experience. Service was really good."
"I only tried a few samples of their goods today because I ran across their table of free samples at the South Park Mall of all places.  I have to say, I would have gladly gone back, cash in hand, for more!  What did I try, you ask?  Well I began with the mini baked loaded potato, which was perfectly decorated with just enough cheddar and bacon..mmmm.  Even after sitting out, the potato was not dried out at all, it was exactly the bite you want out of this tasty treat.  There was also crab cakes bites accompanied by a drop of some kind of spicy sauce, also yummy.  Then there was a mini sandwich of some sort, honestly had a hard time deciphering what exactly was in it...some kind of cranberry cream cheese and meat...eeh.  Then, saved the best for last, a bite if puffed brie with a brush of honey.   All in all, I would absolutely recommend their catering to any kind of event from wedding to corporate!"
"Don't hand out too many 5s but Beasley's definitely gets one. Went here after the recommendations of some people from beer advocate. Mike definitely hooked me up. Recommended a few local hits, and gave me a bottle for free! Also hooked me up with a not to be named beer which is extremely hard to find. Maybe he's loyal to beer advocates, but if even a fraction of this customer service is extended to everyone else he's easily one of the best stores there is, and not just in NC."
"Pretty cool place to visit for kids and grown ups.\n\nFIRST: The penguin show! So you pay an extra $30 and a small group of 6-8 sit in a small hallway with one of the penguins! He just stands around or may walk between your feet but don't touch him! Not because you're not allowed to but rather, he's not a puppy. He doesn't realize petting and biting are not the same thing. If you want to pet him, the trainer will hold his head and let you feel his back and wings but if you want to touch him while he's walking past your feet, no ones going to stop you because you signed a waiver.\n\nThe bird exhibits are pretty cool too. They have feeding times published and it's quite a show. They'll let kids and adults put food in their hands and wait for birds to come snatch it.\n\nLots of pretty birds, fun, the penguin part makes it totally worth it!"
"Great service, quiet, nice owners."
"This is the only hostel I've ever stayed in, so I can't compare it to others. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the building, the full kitchen, and the location (right in downtown). The staff was very nice and helpful, and you can't beat the price. My only complaint was that the heater in my room didn't work. It didn't end up being too cold, so it wasn't a problem on my stay, but would've been a big issue a little later into the season."
Got my wife a gift certificate for her birthday and she loved it. She didn't have a nail person since leaving Cali so she needed to find one she liked. Lucky she found Emma and did a great job.
"I can't even count how many times I've had dinner with a friend at Dish, Zada Jane's, Creation, etc., and we've decided to walk down the street to DQ and get Blizzard afterward. DQ's Blizzards and other ice cream treats are the best on a hot summer night, but you see plenty of people waiting to order even in the winter. \n\nIt's a pretty popular spot, so expect to wait a while. And unfortunately, they only take cash. I highly recommend the Blizzard with Butterfinger or Oreos."
"We are very pleased with our service received from Colburn Enterprises. We did not know any plumbers or who to call, so I read the great reviews online. They are all accurate, and we also had a positive experience as well. We had them come out to change a shutoff valve in garage, a faucet bib with copper line, and a bad faucet line inside bathroom under sink. John was fast, thorough, knowledable, and he is a true professional. I appreciate his honesty, and taking the time to explain and answers all the questions I had. I highly recommend this company. Very reasonable prices and done the right way. Thank you, we will use your company for future issues. Don M."
"Great quality...great service. (sounds like a car commercial). \n\nYuppie preppie clean-cut golf-dude central.\n\nVery polished, some dishes better than others, but most were pretty tasty.\n\nNo seriously, the food is good here, but I felt like I made it a little dirty just by stepping inside."
"Every time I have come here I always get my order correct, a delicious tostada salad, more than decent service, and a $2 coupon for doing a survey on my receipt. The wait time is a little longer than desirable but for fresh, hot food this is completely acceptable. Their salsa bar is always well stocked and clean, and I just can't get enough of their black salsa. It's not spicy, it's just so good! I have not been able to tear myself away from the tostada salad yet but a few other things on the menu look good.\n\nHonestly I am somewhat snobby about authentic Mexican food. This is not authentic, but it's still very tasty and that more than makes up for that. Also they have plentiful outdoor seating unlike other Bajas I have been to."
This is one of Tea Stations small locations but it meets the standard of any Tea Station I have been to. The employees were nice and remembered who ordered what drinks. I ordered a large Thai Tea with boba to-go. It tasted like I expected it to.
"Brooke is amazing. Normally when you get a haircut from a salon owner it costs a lot of money but I've never paid more than $30 for a haircut from Brooke. It looks perfect every time! I've also had my nails done with Amber and they came out great the two times I got them done. This is an excellent, small place. It's also convenient to downtown so I usually go over after getting off work!"
"Booked the online special for a surprise anniversary gift for my wife. Our flight arrived 30 mins early but our driver was already waiting for us at the baggage claim.  As we walked to the baggage claim, Wesley (our driver), was holding our name on a sign. He knew it was a surprise so he hide the rose behind his back and discreetly gave it to me to give to my wife. \n\nWesley helped grab our luggage and took us to the limo. The limo was clean and the champagne was waiting on ice. Wesley was nice enough to take us to a bar before going to the hotel to let us grab drinks n snacks since it would be a lot more expensive on the strip. He was very friendly and courteous.\n\nOur ride back to the airport was great as well. We had Oscar as our driver going back to the airport. He texted me that he was outside our hotel waiting 10 mins early. He was polite and experienced.\n\nMy overall experience with Presidential Limo was awesome. They even emailed me that they dispatched the driver. Would definitely us them again."
"Moving is never fun, but with the great service we received at Walker Furniture, it made the move and furnishing of our home an enjoyable experience. Rexx was our salesman, and he displayed top notched customer service. When he wasn't able to meet us because we didn't set an appointment, he asked Robert to assist us who was another great customer service oriented salesman. \n\nBoth gentlemen should be applauded for their great service and hospitality. \n\nWe will definitely continue to shop at Walker."
"Looking for a traditional Wisconsin Supper Club?  Feiler's is the real thing...its not fancy, its not nice...but its comfy, warm and friendly...have a Brandy Old-Fashioned, sit back and enjoy your Cod..."
Breakfast sandwich on spicy cheese bread.  You just can't beat it.
"This place was HUGE and not what I was expecting. The bird is rather random, but fits with the theme. The scrubs and lab coats were reasonably priced and there were as a HUGE selection. Overall, highly recommend this place. The parking lot is very very small though, so be prepared to walk if its busy."
"Okay I know they are called the Original Pancake House but they have by far the best french toast of any eating establishment I have ever visited.  But you gotta order the challah french toast, not the regular.  Pair it with a side of their awesome bacon and coffee and I am in breakfast heaven.  The only downside is this is the only OPH I have been to that has this on the menu.  Win for Las Vegas.\n\n5 Stars!!"
"Good food, excellent service"
"This was the first time I've eaten Nepalese food, and was a good thing to start on. The food and service was great. The only thing I've found a problem was the portions, for the price. Remember however, this is not Mc Donald's, and is a very nice restaurant. Not everything is super sized people. Over all, if your not STARVING, this is a good place to try. I recommend the momo and dal."
It's my favorite theater in town. I never have a problem when I go. The staff is always friendly and helpful. There was an issue with the ticket machine outside the manager let me in and fix the machine and gave me my ticket. It's a good theater and usually has whatever movie I want to see.
"This place was good and found this on the internet.  Anyways I wished I had the sushi, but I was sick so I went with the noodles which was good. It was nice and hot and filled my belly. I loved the salad as well.  I wished I had the other dishes, but it is okay though.  I would come back here again."
"Great to have a place like this in town so you don't have to place all your orders online. Shipping will get ya man, especially on those larger items. \n\nThe selection here is unreal- they have it ALLLLLL. Brew ingredients are all broken out- good finds for extract, partial-grain, all-grain- whatever you're into. All different yeast cultures, hops, etc. I like to piece meal the ingredients in my recipes so this is my jam. Kits are lame dude. If you have a material need, they got you covered too- fermenting, conditioning, kegging, cleaning, whatever.\n\nStaff is great, completely knowledgeable on the crafts.\n\nThere's another shop in Belmont that's a little bigger, but the selection is still pretty comparable.\n\nDon't miss out on this place. South Blvd directly behind the Sleep Poet (same lot)."
"Typical neighborhood pizza place, but it does the job! It's a cute little shop with sidewalk seating and ice cream window in the summer. The inside isn't anything special but it seems clean. The staff is busy but not unfriendly. Usually though, we order delivery. It comes within the normal amount of time and the pizza is good."
"""For good oily food, this is the place that serves delicious dishes.\n\nWhenever I go to Las Vegas and sick of buffets, I come here for good Thai food.  \n\nAll their dishes are good.  I love their Coconut chicken soup, \""""tom-kha-gai, it is soooo good that goes really well with \""""kai-jew\"""", egg omelette dish."""
"Being a sushi snob, I had always considered Umi to be the city's gold standard.  While it still is, Chaya is very solid as well.  My sashimi was as fresh as possible, which is the most critical requirement (in the East End, one must carefully avoid some other sushi stops).  My son ordered the basic sushi platter, so we didn't give Chaya the chance to show off it's creativity, but his sushi was fresh and well prepared. The dining area is very comfortable as well.\n\nPS - it is BYOB.  We stopped at East End Brewing first for a growler of beer, and the crisp waitstaff at Chaya had beer glasses on our table within seconds after we were seated!"
"Went here for lunch. Really nice staff (young girl taking order and serving). Food is very good, not great. Excellent prices and is authentic not like BS places like Ajo Al's.\n\nNice family owned place"
"1.  Authentic\n2.  Byob ($2 per beer/wine glass + $2 per shot glass if you bring sake)\n3.  Reasonably priced\n4.  Good service\n5.  Cant wait to go back\n\nBe prepared for a wait, but its worth it.   One of the stand-outs on the, less than impressive, Murray Ave.   \nI don't understand the fried chicken thing.... but i will admit - its good!   \n\nThe teriyaki steak was not what I was expecting but then again - how do I know if I have ever really had an authentic teriyaki.  The steak was broiled and came with a very thin steak-juice like sauce.  I'm more accustomed to a thicker sauce which is more prominent in the overall dish.  Not a deal breaker by any means. \n\nBest no-frills sushi I have had here.  It should not disappoint."
I wanted to try Pho for the longest time but never did. I finally got up the nerve and can't believe I waited this long. Pho Saigon 8 is awesome. Incredible prices and even better tasting food. The hubby even said it's the best he's had ( in Vegas) so far.  Most likely gonna make this place a weekly tradition.
"Okay, I'm a Chipotle girl.  No need to try Qdoba in my mind.  But I'm glad I did.  I love that they have several choices including soup and salad variations.  Also, they have a vegetable burrito that is not just beans and guac but also squash and other real vegetables.  Servings are similarly huge so you have to watch your consumption, but nothing is too expensive and four-for-four experiences were very good."
"""I always wonder whether I should bother writing up fast food places.  But in this case, I decided I should.  This is for two reasons.\n\nOne is because Jack has a great menu.  It just sounds so good - all those things on the menu just make the mouth water.  No \""""double cheeseburger\"""" here (or McDouble as it's called now).  Instead you get a BBQ Bacon Sirloin Burger.  With curly fries.  I love curly fries.\n\nAnyway - the other reason is the staff.  At least one member of the staff.  I think her name was Shelia.  She was just a bundle of joy, and this was at a fast food place, during the lunch hour, when she was absolutely slammed (and the people behind her were a bit on the slow side).\n\nShe would make a note of people's names, rather than calling them by number, and as people left - at least as we left - she would even remember their name.  How impressive is that?"""
Ordered a new refrigerator. Had to wait 5 days to get it delivered to our house from the warehouse. It was delivered promptly and when we expected it. The two delivery specialists were incredible skilled. They hooked us up and hauled off the old fridge with out even touching a molding anywhere on the house. Very professional. Thanks a lot Home Depot!
"The food is DELICIOUS. It has an elevated Tex-Mex feel.  Everything is beautifully plated which (in my experience) is somewhat rare for Tex-Mex cuisine. The menu has an extensive variety of options.  Everything I've tried has been great.  \n\nOnto the DRINKS!  They have an incredible, unique selection of drinks to choose from. These are some of the best drinks I've had anywhere in Madison.  The bartenders are talented drink mixers. \n\nMy ONE COMPLAINT about El Dorado...the bar is very busy during dinner on a weekend.  Every seat is taken and the standing room around the bar can be very crowded.  No problem...I can handle a crowd.  The problem is that there are only 2 bartenders behind the bar serving the people at the bar AND people seated at tables for dinner.  It takes FOREVER to get a drink...which is sad because they are so delicious. I came for dinner with a large group, and almost everyone gave up after the first drink because they were tired of waiting and trying to get service at the bar."
"""We visited this restaurant last night on a whim, having decided to just drive through Chinatown and find a place that looked interesting. We made it all the way to Koreatown on Spring Mountain before we decided to backtrack and try out the \""""Argentinian' place.\n\nSince we weren't particularly hungry, we thought that we'd just peruse the menu and pick out a few appetizers. As soon as we saw the guarana and the Belgium-made mango juice, we realized that this wasn't an ordinary deli/restaurant. My son had the lasagna, which he enjoyed, and the rest of us shared the Parrillada Martin Fierro, which was one of the shared BBQ options. The meat was a little better than average, which is probably why it's priced so \""""reasonably\"""", but what really sold it was the fragrance wafting from the cooker plunked down in front of us. That, in combination with the free flowing bread and chimichurri sauce, made it an enjoyable experience that we look forward to replicating in the future.\n\nWe were too full by the end of our meal to try out any of the desserts, but they did look delicious."""
SO good. Everything is amazing from the po boys to the jambalaya.  I can't even make a recommendation just get what you like cause its all so damn good.
"From the moment I entered the building I was impressed. The facility is warm and welcoming, the receptionist was friendly, and the doctor helped me with an ongoing problem I have had since childhood. There were many failed attempts in the past with other practices and methods and I can't thank Summerlin Dermatology enough for giving me my life back."
"Ok, so shortly after writting my review, I had a craving for thai and decided to do Komol for take out. De-li-cious. We had the papaya salad, herb salad and chilli mint chicken, along with some fresh springrolls and some mango sticky rice. Both the Herb and the Papaya salad became my favorites, especially the herb salad!  Yummy deliciousness, its crunchy, herby, and slighty sweet with layers of flavors.\nLater on, my we all went to komol as a big group for my sisters birthday, and caused chaos in the restaurant with 8 adults, two 5-6 year olds and two toddlers.  However, they were very patient with us, and were very courteous. Great food and good service, I will definitely be back, and sometime soon, because I have a papaya salad craving. :)"
"$2 dollar cover and no drink minimums to boot? Sign me up! \n\nCame here on a Wednesday night for open mic night, and was treated to a number of acts from the standup scene in Madison.\n\nThe jokes were exactly what you'd expect from a comedy club: Raunchy, over-the-line, offensive, etc... Now I know that while not for everyone, it is good to throw away your inhibitions once in a while and just laugh. And this place will do just that. \n\nSo please keep your political correctness out the door when you come, because trust me, these aren't your knock knock jokes. \n\nOnce in a while, someone goes a bit too far, and an awkward silence settles over the crowd. The good thing is that they sell alcohol, decently cheap ones at that, so there'll usually be one slightly drunk dude laughing his ass off during the awkward silences."
hot hot hot. my husband and i went here and i had a blast. the guys were hot and ripped. I got about ten lap dances sometimes by two guys at a time. the touched my body everywhere as i did the same to rhem. omg i got a private dance and the dancer got really hard so i gave him and my husband blow jobs. was the best night of my life. for those of u who expect free lap dancers u must be dumb no strip club gives free dances and if u r going to b granny prude what the hell r u doing in a strip club. this place is awesome
"""I really like this store. Their staff is super knowledgeable and has been really helpful to me as I learn \""""fancy\"""" photography while not being snooty to me for being a novice.  Their prices are standard, so you usually pay what you'd pay at Amazon (if you bought new). I haven't bought any used equipment there or had anything printed, so I am just referring to buying lenses and getting advice from them. Not voting on their price 'cause photography is an expensive hobby!"""
Great Food
"So um yeah... THIS PLACE IS GREAT! Of course everyone knows why people go here... FISH BOWLS and they are not just silly old, oh a little bit of alcohol, they mean serious business with these things. NOTE: DO NOT DRINK ALONE bad things will happen. Aside from the well priced and delicious fish bowls, they also have great deals on other drinks which is nice. It is a 3 story building on University and it is GREAT. They even have amazing food during the day if you stop in for a late after noon beer and burger! The people that come there are generally pretty cool and pretty wild which makes this place even more fun! also... of course... FREE BACON AND DOLLAR BEERS!!! WOOO can get a little too rowdy though when your walking across the spilled-beer ocean... Only downside, bouncers? COOL Bartenders? COOL. Staff are all pretty cool and just an all-around fun place to go!"
"Call me crazy but i think capriottis(las Vegas) has better Philly cheesteaks than most places in Philly!! Their capastrami and philly subs are mouth watering! They will not let you down.its slightly on the pricier side for subs, but the taste will make up for it.."
Mmmm sweet Osaka. They have some of the best sushi you can get in Las Vegas.\nAs noted by another user the entrance looks like a crack house. They have traditional Japanese seating where you kneel and take your shoes off.
"This is the best Thai food in Vegas. Not only do they listen when I tell them I want it hot, and not white people hot, but they are also quick like bunnies. We can do a full meal and be out of there in under 40 minutes at lunch time. Service is excellent, wait time is minimal (if at all) and their choices are great. I am a panang snob and their's is perfect. \n\nThe best way to judge any cultures food is by the crowd. When you walk into a Thai food place to find it full of asians, you know you're in the right place. Try it."
"Lupie's is perfect for the long day when only comfort food and sweet tea will suffice. Their Texas chili has the perfect amount of heat, teetering on the edge of sweat-inducing. Upgrade to the chili mac and you're staring a day's worth of caloric intake in one dish, but man it's worth it. Their sides, especially the mac and cheese are creamy and buttery, and just about as good as Grandma used to make too. \n\nJust about everything I've had at Lupie's was tasty. I thought their cornbread was a little bland, but that's a huge nitpick considering how much they get right. If you want some delicious, well-priced comfort food, this unassuming place on Monroe Road is worth every dollar and every bite."
"Charlie's Taco Truck\n\nThese tacos will seduce you until you are ravenous! It all starts out so innocently. The tacos wink at your promiscuously, you attempt to ignore their luscious fragrance, and then BAM!!! You're on the bleachers and the community can't tell where your face ends and those enchanting tacos begin.\n\nMake an effort to enjoy these tacos."
Mmm.  Delicious custard to help save you from that blazing Las Vegas sun.  Rich and creamy.  You need to get some.  \n\nCASH ONLY though.
"My last few experiences were not what I had hoped, but the new tasting menu is excellent and everything I've always wanted from L'Etoile."
"I wish my home town of Columbia, SC had a fish taco place just like this, I love fish tacos. Cabo had a ton of energy when I went, the mood and the atmosphere was hip and quaint like the neighborhood it was nesseled in, on a small corner of Charlotte. The service was fast and friendly. Cabo puts a good foot forward with it's corn salsa and chips that come out before meal, I could have just ate this. When I received my beer battered fish taco my first thought was wow is that food or art. My second thought when I bit into it was grease is the word is the word, can I get a towel over here. Over all Cabo was good I might come back sometime, but I think I'll ask them to towel off my taco next time."
Best pizza in the world outside of Italy.  I grew up with Aiello's and there's nothing quite like it.  Whenever I'm home I make a stop at Aiello's before I leave.  You aren't there for the ambiance and the staff.  Make sure to Youtube the prank call to Aiello's from the Howard Stern show - hilarious.
"Do not let the exterior fool you. This place in not about how nice the outside is, it's about how good the food inside is. Food is great and there is lot's of it. Great variety. Friendly servers. Kitchen slow to get food out to you, but it is well worth the wait. Drunken Noodle and Duck soup ...off the hook."
"Took Nelson Q.'s advice and got a apple fritter. I was forced to get the full size because they were out of the half size.  Om nom nom, nice pieces of apple in the dough. Not too much glaze like other places making it the perfect amount of sweetness. I also ordered a jelly filled, pretty good as well. The dough they use here is awesome because its the in between of the lightness of Krispy Kreme and the thick doughyness of standard donut shops. This might be my new favorite spot for dontus, too bad I live far but on the plus side I will start my intern at UMC next month. So they should be seeing me on a regular basis. Good for my taste buds, but bad for my waist line. Ekks!"
"As soon as I pulled into the parking lot I knew my dinner was going to be delicious. Wonderful smells wafted out- tomato, garlic, Italian spices...mmmmm.\n\nI have driven past this place for years been too intimated to go inside. This was a mistake. I tried the garlic and parsley hand cut pasta (the recommend garlic and rosemary was out) paired with the ammmaazzzing Pomodoro sauce- HIGHLY RECOMMEND. It has just the right amount of zing.\n\nThe next time I have to bring a side or dish for a party I can't wait to grab their prepared mac and cheese and other tasty treats. If you are willing to pay a bit more for local and fresh then this is the place to score your next dinner. You will be rewarded. \n\nPS- Parking can be tricky don't even try for the spaces in the front head straight for the parking lot in the back."
"walked in thinking i would simply order a pizza to go. WRONG!! after being greeted by shelby, i bellied up to the bar, ordered a beer, ordered my pizza, and then ordered spicy chicken dingers while i waited. best way to end a friday, i think. thanks, pullano's!!"
"While living in Tempe for school I made several trips out to Vegas. Obviously getting out of boring old Phoenix was a must, but I am talking about driving all the way just for Rincon De Buenos Aires.\n\nThis place has great variety especially to those unfamiliar with Argentine cuisine. Their empanadas were exactly how I remember them to be when I lived down in Argentina. \n\nI was so over joyed when I learned that the owners made their own chimichurri sauce. I ordered pretty much one of many things and a bunch of empanadas. All of the stuff I had was great.\n\nI would love to make another visit soon."
"i love me some lolo's. Best breakfast in town. I refuse to go to the new location, the charm of the Yuma st location makes this place, ok maybe it doesn't but it sure makes a great experience to get a great breakfast meal in such an unsuspected location"
"This place is so expensive but it has consistently been work every cent.  I go coo coo (sp?) for their egg custard, known as chawanmushi.  SO GOOD.  Everything there is so great!  I highly recommend.  It's authentic.  Their wasabi is also fresh.  If you want good Japanese, this is the place to go.   Go big or go home!"
"I went into this store with my daughter i really think is organize and the staff know where the books you want are and they'd  even accepted my expire coupon .\nMy daughter got the book she wanted and we walk out very happy ,because we were treated nicely ad got take care of ."
"Really convenient Indian store with all the basics, plus a lot of really random stuff I actually don't see very often in India itself..\nThey stock essential survival items (Maggi, Frooti, Frozen Parathas etc) plus all kinds of indian spices and pre-cooked stuff.."
Nice Staff. Food On premises is good. Decor and stylistically not out of date. Elevator ride on North Shafts is more lively then looking at a metal wall. TVs in Room R Large.
This place is awesome. I'm giving it 5 stars for their wonderful service and decently priced designer items. \n\nThey have a nice selection of designer shoes. Some new still in the box. As well as bags and jewelry. \n\nThe people who work there are so friendly and make you feel welcome. The owner is usually there and takes her time with helping you. She asked me what my size I was and found pieces that she thought would look nice on me. I was fixed on this one D&G coat but it was too big on me and she told me the truth. They don't force you to purchase things that don't look good on you. They want you to like what you buy. Whenever I have money to spend I come here and always find something great.
Super fast delivery is an understatement.  I order lunch at least once a week. Rarely does it take more then 10mins to get to me. Always made how I like it and never any problems.
"I'm an admitted cheapskate and have only been for the happy hour, but man, is it a great happy hour. The margaritas are much better than any other place nearby (read: on State St. or at Francisco's Cantina, though I love them in every other way). The food deals are tremendous. You can enjoy a very large plate of steak tacos for dinner if you don't mind eating on a geriatric dining schedule (e.g. before 6:30 pm). A vegetarian friend said the popovers were the best vegetarian dish she'd had at a Mexican or Tex Mex place in town. It's not going to provoke any profound food revelations, but it's a fun spot that won't break the bank."
"Love this course.  Sure its a muni but well maintained and somewhat affordable. Charlotte is giving birth to so many upscale daily fee courses that forget about the blue collar golfer that it's nice to have Renaissance to play.  The area around the old coliseum is growing so fast that I expect the city to begin cashing in so if you get a chance to play here,  do it now and do it often.  Lots of sawgrass and bunkering make wayward shots pay but good drives offer birdie on most holes.  Number 18 is the signature with a slight uphill dog left that leaves a downhill approach to an ampitheatre green over a lake.  Beautiful hole.  Nice course,  not snobby,  and affordable."
"I love this place! We always come for Lunch and it's always packed, I enjoy the fish burrtio, but I'm not the biggest fan of fish, but I like it here bc it has pineapples and other things so I don't get the fish taste.. I also like  the self serve salsas. The service is always fast and I love to sit outside on a nice hot day to enjoy my phat burrito!!"
"Enrico gave me an excellent haircut at a reasonable price ($18 + tip).  There are other places in town that are a little less expensive, but this was by far the best experience I've had at a barber shop since moving to Pittsburgh.  He was happy to accommodate my special requests, and flawlessly shortened my hair while keeping it long enough to totally hide a temporary bald patch - something no other barber has done successfully in the months that I've dealt with this issue.  Although it's best to schedule an appointment in advance, he was happy to work me into his clearly busy schedule.  I am definitely going back to Enrico's the next time I need a haircut!"
great beer good food
"Our first butcher shop in the Valley, but after reading reviews this was THE place to go.  Got some soup bones for the pups, two steaks for us for dinner shouldn't have gone the sirloin steak as said 'was very good' next time will stop trying to be cheap and go with the good stuff.  Also got a ham slice that is the BEST we've ever had, can't wait to go back and stock the freezer with some more delish.  Maybe go back during the week when it's not quite so busy and standing room only."
"I am reviewing the General Store specifically. I went to all of the stores, but the General Store was a nice experience. I went in looking for a miniature liquor bottle for my friend back home. I wanted something unique that we can't buy here in southern NM. (Which is a lot of things) The employee named Mark helped us so much. He explained tons of things about liquor that I never ever knew. Then again, I am a virgin to alcohol. I just turned 21 in January so I don't know that much. I thought it was really nice that he took his time with my boyfriend and I. We had a good time learning from his expertise! He wasn't pushy and respected our budget restraints. I came home with a lot of knowledge about rum and tequila. \n\nThis shop gets 4 stars because it's a little bit more expensive than other liquor stores in Vegas (Lee's Discount), but they do have SOME things that I couldn't find at Lee's. Particularly the Alien tequila in reposado and anejo."
Hadn't been here for years and used a Groupon a few days ago.  The food is all very well prepared and very affordable.
"Record Swap is a great shop. Bob really is passionate about what he does and doesn't carry the pretentiousness that other people at certain stores in the CU area have.\n\nArguably one of the best parts of the store is the $1 section on the second level. This section isn't just Christmas and easy listening - there's a huge varied selection of stuff from all genres. Nicer copies of certain popular/common records might be a little overpriced, but you can usually find a copy of the same record in the $1 bin on the second floor in similar if not lesser condition. \n\nIn addition, the selection of new stuff is getting better. Although it's not as good as Exile's, Bob makes sure to have great stuff out.\n\nI'd definitely recommend checking the store out if you're in the CU area."
"I had *ONE* Long Island Iced Tea... the best long island I have ever had.... \n\nThe rest, as they say, was history (history best forgotten and never ever talked about.)"
"I've enjoyed every meal i've had here and can't leave without getting the grilled meats and Chimichurri. Don't expect a fancy atmosphere as in most places here in Vegas. Feels like im in SF, a whole in the wall deli, family owned with some tasty food.  Haven't tried there sandwiches yet but the Lomito sounds delicous. The empanadas were good but not the best i've had."
"Probably the nicest mall in Charlotte. (FYI: I'm currently sitting at what was once the only Apple Store in Charlotte typing this review.)\n\nWhat exactly makes this the nicest, most luxurious mall in Charlotte?  The stores.  How would I know?  Well, although, I'm your typical, red-blooded, football tossing, American male, I also have a mom and that mom loves to shop.  When she visits me here in Charlotte, she only wants to go to one place and that's Southpark Mall for the Nordstrom's and Neiman Marcus.  The only location of these famous stores anywhere in the Charlotte area.  \n\nIn addition, they have unique stores that you're not going to find in your typical, box mall like Copacetic, delia's, Kate Spade, and my favorite Sur la Table.  \n\nDoes Parking suck?  Of course it does.  Would I recommend going here on Black Friday or the day before or after Christmas?  No way in Hell!  But if you can make it here on the right days on the right times, and you don't mind battling for parking.  A visit to Southpark Mall has something for the shopper in all of us!"
A visit to Penn Brewery is a must if you are a beer lover like me.\n\nA choice of 5 or 10 beer flights! I was tempted to try them all out but unfortunately my travel mates are not beer drinkers... (pop/water drinkers). \n\nMy beer flight ($10) even includes their Okotober Bier... which is one of my fave out of all!\n\nSausage Platter ($7.95) with hot German potato salad on the side. The sourness of the salad does need to get use to but it is great to balance the meatiness of the sausages.\n\nMy next trip for sure will include a Happy Hour stop here at Penn Brewery! $3 for a Pint and 1/2 off appetizer... that's would be such a sweet deal.
Everything I said in 2010 still holds true.  I dare you to find a better seafood restaurant (fish camp) even in an ocean town.  Hushpuppies with honey butter - YUM!  One night they have all you can eat crab legs.  Or you get half an order for around $14 anytime.  That is my new fave - half order with clam chowder.  What are you still sitting there for?  If it's not Sunday or Monday - GO!  GO!
"I personally have had no bad experiences here. Their Mac and cheese is the reason I go there and will continue to be for pretty much ever. It's an appetizer, but there is enough there to fill you up and at $6 after tax, you can't go wrong. I could sit here and go into detail on how cheesy and delicious it is, but it's one of those things you have to experience yourself. \n\nThey have super cheap breakfasts. $1.99 I think? that give you a good portion as well. Not only that but $5 lunch specials such as hamburgers and burgers. Their burgers are pretty good but I haven't had a sandwich yet. All and all, I've had at least 7 items on the menu and nothing has been bad. Their happy hour is good too."
"I found the best pizza in Madison, friends. It took 8 years of Madison-dwelling but after careful consideration this is it. It doesn't get any better in this city. They boast an amazing cheese and sauce combination that other Madison pizza places cannot manage to do. ALSO the calzones are amazing. I get mine with spinach and feta."
"A great place to relax outside and have a beer.  Great beer specials during the week.  It's not really a great place for food, as it is definitely more of a bar than a grill.  The bartenders are very good and always fast to get you a cold one!"
"""I booked a special group dinner event for my mother's 90th Birthday. We had a total of 30 guests including 5 of her great great grand children.  Because of our small group we were seated in the \""""Ladies Waiting Room\"""" that is a part of this grand old train station that has been brought back to its former glory. \n\nGroup events do not generally rate my high expectations.  The Grand Concourse has, in my mind, raised the bar.  The service was exemplary.  The food was very good.  I felt that everyone from Brian and Jennifer in the banquet office to the servers to the kitchen staff were all a big plus in bringing our event to a successful conclusion.  The grand Concourse team demonstrated to me and all of our guests that they really care."""
"""I was very happy with my short stay here. Our room was deliciously cold when we walked in from the humid August air. The staff was friendly. Our bed was comfortable. I had ample pillow choices. It was quiet and I slept through the night. Very clean. My one complaint was \""""where was the robe\""""?. I could not find it anywhere. Hotels need robes."""
"I've been a member of the co-op for many years. I find it to be a warm and welcoming place, with great deals on local and organic produce. Fresh, attractively displayed, and as a member, I can get a smaller quantity (say a half head of cauliflower, or whatever) if I like, just by asking. I usually buy just what's on special, and it's very affordable when you do that. The near east side location is great for me.\n\nThe store is changing quite a bit with the remodel, and a lot of my favorite things are not in stock at the moment, the only reason I'm not giving it five stars currently. I'm looking forward to finding most everything I need again when the remodel is completed. It's going to be very nice in there, and it's already so much more spacious. The expanded meat counter will be a great thing, allowing for customizable purchases. Two chicken drumsticks and one skinless boneless breast? No problem! At least that's my understanding of what will be possible. Time will tell."
"Dee. Lish. Us! \n\nI'm in Madison for work, and have been working hard - so naturally I wanted to treat myself to a nice dinner and wine. \n\nThe place was pretty empty, but what do I care....   Just better service for ME.   I sat at the bar, and Carmen (the tender) was very friendly and helpful.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat or drink and she suggested a couple of things.   \n\nI ended up going with a bottle of Shiraz (bc that's my favorite) and although it was a brand I've never heard of Two Hands, but it too was a great bottle of wine.  \n\nNow the 8oz filet I ordered was grilled to perfection, and the garlic mashed potatoes were an excellent compliment. \n\nHighly recommended for a special treat."
"A great lees location! Great deals and they have a huge selection if whatever you are looking for! From beers to wine to cognac! Store is clean and the workers were very helpful! I asked about a new crown royal and was told they did not have it. But what surprise me was that the worker went and researched it and got back to me and figured out that it is not released yet. Blew me away. For an unexpected stop this location was great!  They had a lot of deals like $3.99 wines! We ended up with four bottles of moscato (our own wine tasting)  with fat cat, seven daughters, the naked grape, and rex goliath! All were great we started with the naked grape and it was good! Smooth fruity and slightly sweet! The red goliath was on the tart side less sweet and a little more of that alcohol essence. The fat cat was great! Fruity sweet and smooth! The seven daughters was a bubbly moscato and was by far our favorite! It was sweet, and tasted like a dessert of wine! Overall very happy and will return for more stuffs!!"
"""Whole Foods market in the hood serving soul food to perfection.  Hidden at the back of this grocery store is Mario's southern style cooking to perfection. Reminds me of the time i used to live I. Louisiana.  Places authentic and good as this is so hard to find since most good tasting restaurants here cater more to locations where people are willing to spend more. \n\nThis place is a hidden treasure. I never get anything else but the catfish in here.  I can always find other places in Vegas that cooks good ribs, chicken, pork....but catfish this good is a rarity.  Save money by getting the \""""oh my dinner\"""" meal which includes your choice of meat and 2 sides for 8.99! My favorite sides are the sweet yams, Mac n Cheese and peach cobbler.\n\nDon't be scared to enter this place because of the location.  People here are friendly.

"""Disclaimer: We're Showmars at Arrowood \""""regulars.\"""" \n\nFor whatever reason, we got started eating dinner there every Friday night a year or so ago, and rarely miss one if we're in town (exciting life, huh?). Over that time, we've seen staff come and go, experienced their bad nights (and good), and managed to strike up a few friendships among the folks behind the counter and at the tables.\n\nThat said, I can't say we've ever had a \""""bad\"""" experience there. The food has always been consistently good and quickly served. Their fried seafood is among the best anywhere- bar none. My father from Charleston SC loved Showmar's fried shrimp and had to have some whenever he came to town.\n\nThey also have an assortment of burgers (try the Old-Fashioned on a pita), chicken, salads, and Greek entrees. I have yet to have anything I wouldn't order again!\n\nShowmars is one of those places the locals know about, but chain-restaurant seekers would never try. Their loss."""
Pappaya salad the way I like it. They close at 4 am
"You cannot go wrong with any of their burritos or tacos. Corn salsa is delish. Margaritas are refreshing. Jalapeno mashers are my favorite side item! Only complaint, sometimes the tuna could be prepared more med rare."

"When I lived in Pittsburgh, I would go to Pipers every weekend for brunch. Brian was always manning the bar, ready to serve up a Strongbow from the tap, and the boxtys were always incredible.\n\nWell - things change. I've moved away now, but I still stop by Pipers when I come back to town to visit. They use ground sausage instead of real bangers in the Irish Boxtys now, which is a bummer, but it's still the most incredible brunch place you could wish for.  The people are great, the food is delicious, the beer list is fabulous (they usually have at least 2 cask beers available, and the tap list is extensive).\n\nBasically, if you live in Pittsburgh, you should be eating here.  If you're just visiting town, stop in.  And if you ever meet someone who doesn't like this place, push them to the ground, and hold them there until the police can arrive, and then explain the issue and that the person is insane, and the police will probably lock them up for the good of society."
"HEADS UP: Cash only!!\n\nI'm going to second what Andy C said .... CASES filled with vegan donuts\n\nAgain, I'm not vegan but my daughter is... and as I started to t ype my next line I see that Andy C also said the same thing - there's no reason all donuts couldn't be vegan. These are really very good.\n\nI wish I'd got a cake donut too, because they're my 2nd favorite, but I got the maple bar. ... ... mmm mmm good. We also got an apple fritter, an apple turnover, an apple burrito, a plain glazed and lemon filled.\n\nCan't imagine anything being bad."
Really everyone? Just 4 stars? Crow's Dairy get's 5. They have the best chevre I've ever tasted. Consistently excellent smooth texture. The flavor has the nice tanginess of goat cheese but it's very smooth and clean. Some goat cheeses can get a little too overwhelming. I've been buying them at a various local farmer's markets for a while. Since I'm slow on the uptake I didn't realize it was available on the shelves of the Phoenix Public Market every day of the week. Now that I know that I'll be eating it much more frequently. Yum.
"We went by there tonight, and it was CLOSED!, so sad after 10 years in Summerlin, they are gone."

So people dig them. \n\nI mentioned the buckwheat pancakes, that's just what I get....they have like 20 different kinds, as well as lots of other stuff: Blintzes and omelets and so on. My wife always gets this huge puffy spinach omelet that is really good, but everything I have had is good there. I will agree with the reviewer that wasn't thrilled with the potato pancakes, but I figured that was just what potato pancakes were like, I've never had them anywhere else. \n\n\n\nAlways busy, closes by 3 pm."""
This is the spot I go after work.  Kevin the bartender seems very laid back and maybe even bored sometimes but he's nice.
"Probably the best thing I ate in Pittsburgh was a sausage sandwich from here. It was so simple and a touch spicy, just perfect. This was the real food I imagined when I planned my trip here. The staff was delightful and excited about their food. It's a total shithole, but in a beautiful way. I love Frankies."

We dealt with several people at this location and HE was the one that got things done for us....and he fixed the problem without costing us a cent....the right thing.  Thank you.

"I technically should have more than one check in here, but I always get so excited going here that I always forget. I am a ball of happy when I come in and when I step out. Diana is the absolute best! She is kind, very informative, patient, and just awesome. Been there for two piercings and a few other time for some sparkly jewelry change. \n\nI have heard the rest of the staff is awesome too.

"Love the chicken  paired with mashed potatoes!  I have to extra of that butter sauce though! I've had the Marsala once & it was good with a ton of mushrooms. But I can't get over the bryan! \nThe calamari with the spicy marinara just makes me melt with good feelings! I love the infused oil, but I always add extra salt stir & let it sit a few minutes for the spices to actually get into the oil\n\nI occasionally order the Johnny combo which curbs my bryan cravings but I also get a great flavored steak. \nThe smell when you walk in is amazing & sends my stomach growling. My husband always orders the mezzaluna or lobster ravioli. \nI personally don't care for the salads at all. The ceasar dressing has a bite that burns my tongue & I hate the other dressing. The soups I don't care for either, but I dont come for that. \n\nI just love this place. I've not had a bad meal here ever"
"While on a trip to Charlotte, we visited this restaurant because we had seen it on Diners, Drive In, and Dives. \n\nBecause of the time of day we went, we got in with no wait at all. The salsa we got before the meal was very fresh and very good. The Beer Battered Shrimp Tacos were excellent. It was with worth searching out this restaurant because it was worth the hype. \n\nMy only complaint is that since I do not live in Charlotte, I cannot have these tacos more often."
"they have the best food and the greatest mushroom soup ever. sadly, they are so damn crowded! ahahahahaha."
"""I am a big fan of  great Chicago style pizza from Gino's or a New York style pizza pie from Ray's on 7th st.,but Detroit pizza can certainly hold it's own.

"I give this place a 10 out of 5 stars!  Seriously, I cannot tell you how much I love their coffee.  I am officially a coffee snob after loving their coffee for so long.  I always have their beans at home to enjoy and stop by when I can for a specialty drink (hello, White Zombie!).  The employees are wonderful and attentive and consistent!  Now that my husband and I have moved away from Madison (sadly) we appreciate and miss their coffee even more.  We stock up on beans every time we're in town.  We cannot find any other coffee shop or roasters who even come close to comparison.  Truly.  Madison, you have no idea how lucky you are to have Ancora!  :)"

"I went to get my new cheap watch resized and the old man there said it would be $10, which is completely reasonable. It took him 10 minutes and he even showed me how to work the watch! He told me I didn't have to pay for it :)\n\nReally great people there!"
"Great for when I want to have a Taiwanese/Hong Kong style dish and they do have great bubble tea. I've had better food elsewhere, but it's great for Pittsburgh. Some of the dishes can be inconsistent in qualify from time to time. However, the restaurant is in a great location in Squirrel Hill, and it definitely fulfilled my cravings for Taiwanese/Chinese food when I did go there! :)"
If your ever in Charlotte come here its an institute and they have PORK WINGS.
"I'm so a fan of this place! It's an actual old church with a brewery on the pulpit! The food is good, the pizza's are great, they're made in a brick oven (or taste like they are), the couscous salad is phenom, and the while they have a small selection of brewed on-site beers, it's totally quality over quantity. I haven't had a beer there that wasn't yummy and interesting. \n\nThe mango curry was very disappointing, and the chipotle ketchup for the sweet potato fries is lacking any major flavor (the fries themselves are yummy though).\n\nBeautiful decor inside and wonderful quiet beer garden outside. Always a blast!!"
"Visited the Shiloh on a Sunday evening before things started getting busy. This is a friendly unpretentious place that is inviting.   It was too cool to enjoy the deck dining. The offering of craft beer on the menu were plentiful, but sadly the two my man wanted had kicked and there was no back up.  He found a third to try, but really wanted his first pick.  Guess the weekend got ahead of them, and when you are out, you are out.  I was happy they serve Kaliber non alcohol beer which is my favorite.  The menu isn't large but offers a interesting selections.  We ordered the cheese balls and WOW are they delicious.  This isn't your ordinary mozzarella cheese stick like balls.  The waiter said the cheese is made locally and had a soft, salty and tangy bite.  I enjoyed the pork tacos that were so good I would have them again.  My man had the hamburger advertised as one of the best in Pittsburgh - he agrees."
"I have had jewelry repaired here, sold jewelry here, and purchased here. I shopped around many jewelry stores and Perry's definitely gave me the best price for my old gold by hundreds of dollars. Most recently I had a ring that I've had for 22 years repaired here when the flimsy band broke. Perry's offered me a different variety of options to repair it. They gave me an inexpensive option (to Sauter it) and also the option to have the ring re-banded. I chose to re-band and It was worth every penny!! Honestly, it still wasn't that expensive. In Every experience I've had here, I have been met with a knowledgeable and very courteous staff and have been satisfied with the work. Their selection of estate jewelry is phenomenal. You should not buy, sell, Or have any piece of jewelry repaired anywhere but here."
"My first experience wherewithal Car Wash Inc was more like buying a luxury car have owned Infinity.Environment was welcoming, calm and professional. Justin Fuller was the salesman and he was eager to be flexible in finding a way to meet my needs. The whole process was simple, low key and fast. Was very satisfied with the whole experience."
"Nice atmospher, good beer selection. Had an appitizer, the scotch eggs, and then fish and chips for lunch.  Both were very good and i would recommend.  Seated quickly.  Waitress must of been having a bad day, short and not very informative.  Our group of nine was pleased with food, displeased with waitress demeanor."
"I have been eating at Cabo for years now...before NoDa became the conglomerate that it is now.  The food is consistently good.  The flour tortillas that they use for their tacos are delicious all in their own.  I love the queso dip (the best I've had) and I've eaten at plenty mexican restaurants.  The Wraps are great and filling as are the entrees.  I will say that yes, at times, the chips are stale and the salsa isn't anything to write home about but who cares...it's an appetizer and it's free! I've never been impressed with their Margaritas so I usually stick w/Modelo or a Sweet Tea.\n  It is also a good place to take out-of-towners or maybe a first date.  It is usually VERY noisy so don't expect to have a super romantic time here unless you are a very laid back type of couple."
"I love this Hardee's!  The employees are probably the most friendly of all the fast food places in town.  Yes the service is slow - read their slogan - real beef cooked on a grill by order - nothing is precooked, that's why it tastes better then the other burger joints."
"My favorite place for steaks in Charlotte. They don't nickel and dime with family style overpriced sides or push bottled water. The filet tips are outstanding! Meals come wit salad and sides. The salad toppings are brought to the table, you pick the toppings. Reasonable prices."
"This is a great dog friendly hotel in PIttsburgh. \n\nIn regards to pets, I was a little nervous here as there is a series of two elevators to get to every room. Everything ended up working out just fine, but I ended up avoiding walking my dogs past the lobby during breakfast.\n\nI made a reservation using those pesky category 1-4 vouchers that Marriot gives when you spend a certain number of nights at the hotels. They made a reservation for a 1BR. When I got to the hotel, they had no 1BR available, only studio. The hotel staff was EXCELLENT and put me in a 2br until the 1br was able to open up. \n\nMajor props to the staff and the great dog friendly policy."
"Thai Basil is my go-to for take-out Thai food. I have yet to have a bad meal.\n\nThe crab Rangoon is consistently the best I've had and a great treat once in a while. prik king is excellent, as is the spicy cashew nut. All the curries are good but a little thin. I think Thai Basil does their best work with their stir fry, so you may want to hold in that direction.\n\nService is quick and I've never gotten anything that I've had to wait a significant amount of time for...10 minutes to be finished, tops. Just call them, hang up and then drive over.\n\nThey have a scale of 1 to 5 for spicy and 4 is usually quite good. 5 is still easy to eat, but a little one dimensional in flavor profile. \n\nAlso, be advised that sometimes an extra ingredient not listed on their menu may work its way in to the dish. If you have an allergy, you may want to mention it."
"feel weird about rating a grocery store, but, couldn't resist! copps is awesome! as an illinoisian, didn't know what i was missing! fresh salad bar open during all hours as far as i can tell - many a lunch and dinner had here! so much to choose from! welcome alternative to fast food lunches during the workday! and awesome nuts/dried foot help-yourself selection! i'm usually a woodman's gal, but this place is awesome!"
"Lots of great Vegas souvenir crap at cheap prices!\n\nLooking for tee shirts, shot glasses, ashtrays and magnets? Look no further.\n\nMy fave item that they sell happens to be used deck of playing cards from actual hotels. I like stuff like that."
"They saved my puppies!  I adopted two puppies from the pound and 4 days after getting them home they came down with parvo.  The vets and staff where fabulous!  They where super caring and honest with the possible outcome. They didn't get upset with my calling all the time and where very patient with me and wonderful with my puppies.  Thanks to their caring attention to detail my puppies and happy, healthy and parvo free."
"The sushi was fresh, the service was great, it felt like a genuine restaurant from Japan. Whenever I went, there was always a bit of a wait, but the wait is worth it."
"I've only ever been here for brunch, but I've never been disappointed. The hostess is sweet and usually gets you seated right away, even if you don't have a reservation. I personally prefer coming in the warmer months so you can sit outside, but the inside is nice too.\n\nDecent bloody marys, EXCELLENT crab cake benedicts. The caramel apple french toast is pretty spectacular, too."
"I can't say enough good things about this veterinary clinic.  Their staff are all very friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable at their jobs, and the docs are great!  I called yesterday because our dog had a gland issue and they literally told me to bring him in and they would see him (even though they had a full waiting room).  They did surgery and we had our dog the same afternoon.  The Vet explained everything in detail and answered all of my questions.  Their pricing is also very fair, and the care that they provide is awesome!  Big thumbs up for this business!"
"A real pool hall.  Plenty of tables.  Ask about their special rate, we played for over 6 hours at a cost of 16 dollars.  It is located several blocks off the strip in an older part of town."
"""I come here every few weeks to stock up on my Trader Joe's items, most specifically their Parmesan cheese and the Mynts.  Lately I'm considering going to a GFCF (gluten free, casein free) diet and the fact that all the GF items have a big \""""g\"""" by their price tag makes it very easy to figure out what I need.  There was even a list when I walked in the door of the GF products they carry.  Also, I sometimes cook with wine, but I don't drink it so I get their least expensive bottle, which is under $3, and still a good quality wine, so I'm told.  Actually, everything I've had at Trader Joe's is just delicious and very good quality."""
"seems to be a great little venue.  Large selection of beer, could use a few more bathroom stalls, but can't really knock that.  sound is good, acts are fresh, enjoy that that they bring in local's to open.  would love if i could get a slice of pizza or something to nosh on before the show starts.  but those are all minor complaints.  will be back soon, wish more people in charlotte saw live music."
"The Wisconsin Craft Market is one of the first places I go when looking for almost any craft supply. The store is well organized, prices are fair and the staff have always been friendly and helpful whether in person or calling ahead to see if they have what I'm looking for in stock. I've picked up supplies for stamping, embroidery, painting, beading and kids projects. They have a nice paper selection and a wide variety of yarns. The one thing you won't find here would be fabric or sewing supplies. If you sign up for their newsletter you will get updates on new items and regular coupons. They may not be as large as some of the chain stores in town, but I've never been disappointed and I prefer supporting a local business. Because they carry a little bit of everything, I think it's a good place to start before visiting any of the specialty stores which cater to one craft or another."
"i love this place. very rarely do i get to go out and tie one on. when i do, this is were i want to be at some point in the night. where else can i go and request the cramps? i...love...this...place, it makes me happy. i suppose i should go on and on about what it's like, but i won't. go and experience it for yourself."
"Eggstra! Eggstra! Eat all about it!\n\nThat eggcerpt is just one eggsample of the delightful egg puns you'll find scrambled throughout the menu. Four of us awoke ready to go on a brekky eggscursion, and knew eggsactly what we needed... The Good Egg. I'm not eggsagerating, it was speggtacular. We were eggshausted still, and eggscited about the coffee. The eggs benedict arrived eggspeditiously, and I nearly eggsploded in my pants. They perfectly eggsecuted the yoke. Breathtaking, I couldn't eggshale until the yoke finished eggscreting over the english muffin. It wasn't even as eggspensive as you'd eggspect, I'll definitely be back eggain. This is one spot I won't send to eggsile. The only eggsception, and the only reason we weren't in complete eggstacy, was that our eggsecutive decision to sit outside was accompanied by an eggsentric pigeon, who clearly had pigeon AIDS. The bird was eggravating. I'd give 5 stars if it weren't for that eggstenuating circumstance. Pigeons should be eggstinct in my opinion. I hope I didn't eggstract anythin from it. It eggsuded eggstreme eggspressions of anger, but I still eggspress high reggard for this eggstablishment. I hope I didn't eggsploit the egg puns here. Thanks eggeryone!"
On the suggestion from another Yelper i went in here to have a screw put in my glasses. They Open at 930 during weekdays and 9 am on saturday. She quoted me a price before the work began. She was friendly and had the screw put in quickly and adjusted them for me too. And made sure they fit right before i left. This is a blessing in disguise and anytime i need glasses repaired or know someone who needs them repaired i will recommend this company. Its close to the 95 and Valley View and Close to the i15 freeway and the strip for future reference.
"""Chef Rubber is my \""""go to\"""" for SO many things!  Flavor, colorants, sugar & chocolate work equipment and supplies,  molds and forms, molecular gastronomy and my favorite......advice!  If I'm in a pickle, and can't figure something out, one of the staff at Chef Rubber can usually brain storm with me to find a solution.  They are so VERY friendly and knowledgeable!  I get my orders faster from Chef Rubber than any of my other vendors, and they are always accurate.  I teach cake, sugar and chocolate classes all over the country, and I mention or refer my students to Chef Rubber numerous times in each class.  I firmly believe that an artist is only as good as the products they use, and in edible art, quality is even MORE crucial because of it's utilization of all 5 senses.  If you want to improve the quality of your edible art, start using Chef Rubber's products!"""
I love this place. I'm from LA and when ever we are in town we go there. The massages are always great and relaxing. The ambiance isn't that great or else I would give it 5 stars but they have definitely cleaned it up since we were there before. It was cluttered. But the place itself is very clean. And the prices are very reasonable especially considering how good the masseuses are.
"Here in Anthem, they always do a great job.  Their roll-out of the new, more efficient containers was well coordinated and informative beforehand.  Just hope my bill is reduced because they only collect once a week now."
Best.\nBar.\nEver.
"I highly recommend Wendy Nickell for Therapeutic Massage as she takes a personal interest in her patients and asks all the right questions to pin point your specific needs not only with muscle & skeletal needs but nutrition as well.   Wendy can assist you with all of your health issues with correct diet & supplements as well as massage.  Call her, you won't regret it.   Personally I had a knee pain issue and through Wendy's nutritional advice and supplement recommendations my knee pain has been alleviated.\n\nRuby Daniels Schmidt"
"Very creamy & very chocolatey hot chocolate, served at a drinkable temperature. For that last trait alone, they get four stars. Hot chocolate tastes so much better when you don't burn your tongue numb with the first sip. Bonus points for pricing their items with tax included in nice, easy numbers. No fumbling to come up with $2.87 here - I didn't even have to take off my gloves while stopping in to grab a drink on my way elsewhere."
"THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED\n\nAnd it's a real shame. I would order from Pizza Amier at least once a month, despite the occasional rude interaction with whoever answered their phone. A note in their window says they will reopen at a new location in the future, but no date or time frame is listed."
"If you're looking for really good Viet food this is the spot! Outside it looks really ghetto, but some of the best places look like a dive. My boyfriend and I ordered pho and some mi kho. I'm picky about my pho, but this was the best pho I've had in awhile. Boyfriend thought the mi kho was a bit too oily, but he finished most of his. Their cafe sua da was bomb also! And to top it off we got both our macaron ice creams for free courtesy of our server. Awesome food and bomb service!! Will definitely be coming back!"
"Great find!  This location is very close to my work, so I figured - why not?  Went in during a busy lunch hour and still got out in an hour.  I had the gel manicure done (French), and it was fantastic!  Haylie was my manicurist.  She has incredible attention to detail, made sure I was happy with all aspects, and can carry on some funny conversation.  And they use OPI GEL products!  Hard to find!\n\nOverall, a French gel manicure cost me $30.  It always costs me at least $15 more everywhere else.  Not many frills on the outside, but equipment is all brand new and they use top of the line products.  Definitely going back."
"Love the Brewworks, especially their pizza, their pierogies and their watercress salad with salmon. Oh, and the beer. Thumbs up!! My only suggestion is that they improve the lighting in their courtyard to something more subtle. There's just too much glare at the moment."
"Good food, servers are wearing gloves! Clean place."
Been here a couple times.  Good home town cooking.  NOT for the dieter.  Come here and expect to gain some calories.\n\nThey do have a happy hour where they have these $1 10oz'ers from draft.  That was pretty cool.\n\nPrices aren't bad.  They have a HUGE room in the back for large parties.  I went for a friend's retirement and it was very convenient considering he knows MILLIONS of people it seems like.
"I have never had a bad experience.  I have brought friends here for piercings as well and they have all been extremely pleased.  DON'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE!  You will not regret your decision to use Halo.  I trust them completely.  Halo is immaculately clean.\n\nThe staff is top notch.  Ana has ninja fast hands.  Truly.   Ana is the most professional, knowledgeable, funny, and friendly piercer.  She can make even the most nervous person feel at ease and has done my last three piercings.  Tish and Stephani are both super friendly at the counter.  Both gals are helpful about jewelry choices. \n\n(Just be careful....piercings are addicting. *wink*)"
"Oh dear. I'm in love with bojangles. That is one really tasty biscuit. I've only been to 2 other bojangles near south park and this one is def tons better than that one.  They put chunks of beef in the gravy for mash potatoes AND in their dirty rice! \nChicken is great, not as amazing as Price's but I come here for lunch a lot. Did i mention how much i love their biscuits!?"
Great service. Always fast and courteous.
"Wow an Asian market that actually looks like a grocery store, well kind of.  It's set up like any other super market, but it still has that cozy feel to it that the smaller shops have.  The selection is of course wider than smaller places, but I still have not found any Ramune anywhere besides the World Market.  \n\nAnyway, I loved the fact that it felt like I was walking into an American  grocery store and then immediately saw the shrine to Buddha.  Plus I really liked the lucky cat statues at the registers.  Not to mention the people who work there are very friendly and helpful."
"We go out of our way to eat here and have never had a bad meal.  The K5 noodle bowl, soups, crab rangoons, and even the general tso's chicken are great.  Nothing tops the K5 noodle bowl though.  Prices are cheap and the food is made quickly.  One of the best places in Oakland.   I see there are a lot of bad reviews and maybe some people have had bad experiences, but I don't hesitate to recommend them.  In my opinion this place is top notch and worth sharing."
"I took my car in for a 45,000 mile required service, and found it to be a very pleasant experience.  I made an appointment, and was seen right away.  The staff are all very friendly and honest about the necessary repairs, and the waiting area is very clean and comfortable.  The coffee and donuts were a nice touch."
"I really like this beauty supply store, it's just so far from where I live.  So when I do get to that side of town, I  usually stop in because I know they have something I need or haven't seen, or need to get."
A slice of Italy - home made sauce & pasta - great service.  Wine list is a little thin.
"Easily my favorite rental car company and first choice when I'm traveling on business.  As a Gold Member, it's an easy rental process for me.  The car is waiting for me to pick up.\n\nSince my last review, they've continued to deliver high quality service and provide great cars.  Not much has changed since that review.  The only downside to this rental car company is cost.  They're always the highest rental fee per day....but you have to pay for quality.  \n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
"Well,I'm Turkish. I shop in this store much more often than other European/Mediterannean grocery stores in Vegas. If you know which days to shop, you'll get the best veggies and fruits here.And for the right days,just ask any of the girls..."
"I've been coming here since I heard of $1.25 fish taco Tuesdays and every Tuesday has been the same routine: get out of work, call Rubio's, order 3 flour fish tacos, and pick em up on my way to choir practice.  Every time I call and tell them my name, Jesus always recognizes me when I come to pick them up. Jesus brings back the comfort of being a regular at your favorite place and he always make that exception of ringing me as soon as I wall through those doors. Thumbs up for Jesus and the staff at Rubio's on Lake Mead! Happy eating! :)"
"I've taken 2 bridesmaid dresses here to be altered and both have been done very well.  The dresses took about a month each, which I think is standard.  If I had needed something sooner, I'm sure he could accommodate it.\n\nHis store hours are pretty good: 6AM - 4PM (M-F) and 6AM -12PM (Saturday).\n\nOnly con is that it's cash only, so make sure to swing by the ATM before you pick up your garment!"
Thought I would give the new Fish Sandwich Special a try.  I thought it was great.  Fast food usually gets a bad rap but this sandwich was much better than most restaurants I have been to.
Great food but a little slow... I will be back when in the area for sure
"How can I say no to Nordstrom? I can't. They (thanks god!) carry Marc Jacob Bags, eeek!! soo happy!!  their service is 99% really nice, but sometime there these young girsl who are really mean (scary). But overall they are soo awesome! Love their clothes selection too!! and the price isn't that bad ( in my opinion, since i have a pretty decent job) soo xox Nordstrom! :)"
"Never had a bad meal here.  Hotcakes are delicious, Lyonaise potatos (home fries) are to die for, and most everything else is near as good.... Except for the coffee!   Which needs some real creamer rather than the dilute milk provided and some extra care with selection and brewing.  But the hotcakes are yummy!!!\n\nAlso a very friendly, quick, and quality place to cater from."
"Five stars because of the variety + creativity. Whether searching for soaps, quirky games, common sense, joke, or unordinary books, erotic fantasy, dog treats, baby/babyshower presents, or you name it stuff, they've got it. \n\nThe staff is nice, approachable. I broke a frame (accidentally, of course) and he didn't hit me when I brought it to the register and confessed. That was nice too. \n\nThe place is big. What could've been three large rooms they've decked out kind of maze-like. On a busy day you might be squezzing to get through - and it's worth it. It may keep you busy for a bit unless you know what you want. For the creative at heart and those searching for gifts with wrapping included, this is the place to go."
"Looking for a new chinese food joint after our neighborhood place, Full Ho, closed at 95 and Jones.  Checked Yelp and decided to give this a try.  Went for lunch with my brother and ordered from the lunch specials, plus an extra apetizer of moo shu pork.  I had the mongolian beef and my brother had the chicken with lemon sause.  Both came with fried rice and a spring roll.  Large portions priced right.  The food was all excellent, flovorful, spicey and great service.  This is my new place to go!"
"As a fairly discriminate gym hopper, I am surprisingly pleased with 24 hour fitness.  The staff is friendly and helpful. The facilities are pretty clean.  I have never had to share a lane in the pool (which is just irritating).  \n\nI was pretty amused by the um..variety of patrons.  I mean I have seen ALL types, sizes and ages here, which is really cool.  Definitely not your typical meat market gym.  \n\nMy only complaints are very  banal and useless, so I won't even bother.  Finding a gym I am comfortable at is the key to consistency for me, so I am super happy I decided to give 24 hour fitness a try."
I just had a haircut from Addy and it looks phenomenal! She had a mess to work with and she slowly and diligently worked on my hair to the point of perfection.  It looks styled and has a great line to it. No more disaster hair. Best part is she respected that I didn't want it cut real short but yet she still made it look good. I will be going back to her!
"Where else can you go and have unlimited lobsters, crabs, freshly made sushi, oysters for $14.95? I think this place is one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. The Wynn buffet is awesome, but the price is way too high. Normally, my friends would dine there during lunch for a little over $8 bucks, drink included. But if you're really into sea food, go there for the weekend dinner, which has oysters, lobsters, crabs, etc... Base my past experiences, the best time to eat there would be on Saturday, because that's when everything is so fresh (I think older stuff would probably be gone after Friday dinner). And sunday, because it's a all day dinner buffet, you may experience stuff sitting out for too long and therefore won't taste as good. For all out of towners, you gotta try this. For peep in LV, try it once in a while, b/c eating too much of this stuff = high cholesterol and weight gain ..lol."
"Fast service, whether you're inside or in the drive thru. Once I order, I usually have my food in less than 3 min. Food is always fresh and doesn't seem like it's been sitting, like other fast food places."
"This place was huge!  It's located in the sketchy area of town and the parking lot was almost nonexistent, but they've got scrubs, lab coats, stethoscopes, and all kinds of medical jazz you need.  Like, whoa.  I bought a nice lab coat here for $19, which I thought was reasonably priced. \nThere isn't much to say about this place except this is THE place to get your medical uniforms here.  It's bomb diggity. I highly recommend it."
I came here looking for a fill and wax.I was greeted by  Kim who was very nice. She listened to how I like to my eyebrows and did great .  \nWhen it came to my nails she looked at them and said she's have to take them off and start fresh. I was a bit hesitant because i just wanted a fill but glad i listened because my 1.5 wk old set from a different shop came off with no effort. She did a fabulous job on them and i will be a returning customer!
"My entire family has gone to Doc for years. He's wonderful.  He is the kind of dentist that puts everyone at ease, including those who need extensive dental work.  Dr. Garhardt is professional and down to earth.  He once came in outside office hours to help my poor husband who had (unbeknown to us) an abscessed tooth.  He'd just returned from a fishing trip, it was a Friday night, and it was either the ER or Doc's office.  He's just that kind if guy.  He goes out of his way to take care of his patients.  I believe he also takes just as good care of his staff, who are always warm, welcoming and helpful.  Dr. Garhardt also cared for my disabled father, going above and beyond to ensure his comfort and care were top-notch. \n\nRecently my family relocated to Denver, and we are sad that Doc won't be our dentist any longer, but I had to write a review acknowledging his practice.  Anyone on the Las Vegas/Henderson area would be well served to seek out Dr. Garhardt!"
CLOSED... Unfortunately...\n\nWe need more French restaurants in the Burgh.
"Been a while since I've had Sammy's and decided to try this location out since it's the closest one to work. I've been to 4 other locations before and this one was probably the smallest and simplest one, with only a few booths and mostly table seating. They also have a few tables on the patio if you like to eat outside.\n\nI ordered the usual must have mini duck tacos and decided to try a prosciutto pizza. The duck tacos were wonderful and I was happy to be able to get the sauce on the side. the pizza was fresh and crispy and had a nice kick of garlic that wasn't too overpowering.\n\nThe waitress was friendly, but maybe overly so because she responded to many of my questions or requests with playfully sarcastic remarks. I would return to this location to grab a bite but it doesn't seem like the place to lounge around like the Centennial and Green Valley locations are."
Cool old building nice interior great staff.  Cool looking at brew stations behind large glass.\n.German beers are prominent though they offer pale ale & IPA each of these have a German flare.  Not saying that's bad just don't expect typical American beer styles.\n\nBurger  & fries were good.
"Service is always good. Get the following:\n\n1. Peking the duck\n2. Honey, you like walnut shrimp?\n3. Garrick n peppa powkchop \n\n... Portions are huge so bring your friends and your fam.. & me! But you're treatin! \n\nWhy 5th star? Cause they don't have sriracha! I mean, c'mon, isn't sriracha Chinese hot sauce?"
"A quick, simple math equation to describe my feelings toward the Penguin:\n\nPixies + Frank Sinatra + cheap, delicious burgers = my kinda place\n\nI'd even say it's a good alternative for a weekend spot, as it's open late, has a full bar and just a fun atomosphere."
"Stopped in here because it looked good from the street and we were hungry for some dinner. It's a big, loud, boisterous place, but certainly inviting.\n\nThe menu is fairly basic meat and potatoes combinations, though there are interesting twists. The beer selection seemed slightly narrow, but the red ale (Hydrant, I believe) was actually exceptionally tasty.\n\nI got the brat platter with sweet potato fries and garlic mashed potatoes. The brats were okay. One of them tasted like a basic hot dog, which sucked. The sweet potato fries were very good, but I really could have done without the powdered sugar. The garlic mashers were also quite good. The portions were fairly large and I wasn't able to finish everything.\n\nOverall, this seemed like a really cool place and the beer was quite respectable. It seems like one of the better restaurants in the North Las Vegas area. Definitely worth a look!"
"We used to go there for the half price menu after 9pm! I am from India, and the food is pretty authentic, tasty and reasonably priced. We tried almost everything on their menu. We will not get the Biryani again, just because it was ordinary, not bad. Everything else was good!"
"""Chicken kabob, baba, must o khiar, falafel, baklava, hummus, all really good. If it did not feel a little \""""fast foodie\"""" it would be better.\nI recommend the chicken kabob highly. The baklava is, according to my wife, fantastic. The hummus was good, and the baba ganoush was awesome.\nI will be going back."""
"Ole Smokehouse, closed with a big For Lease sign on the building. Rat's ass."
"Although they just punched the greens and sanded them....the layout is nice....I will be back to play it again in a few weeks...I will have an course conditions update!....some people throw out hate, but I always give it a second chance!..talk to ya later!"
"Located in a strip mall on Independence Blvd. \n\nThis location seems to be a little bit bigger than the one I usually shop at (Myers Park). Very much like the other locations well laid out with a nice selection of craft beers, you won't find much in the way of hard to find or rare beers, but for readily available stuff it's a decent place. I like the fact that you are able to build a mixed six pack. The service is not great unless you are shopping for wine, but I usually don't need assistance anyway.\n\nI think I still prefer the Myers Park location, but if I'm on this side of town it's worth a stop in."
"I'd personally give this 3 stars, but my boyfriend really really loves this place.  A LOT.  The food is a little too greasy spoon for me.  But Barbs is a friendly place and I do respect that.  The prices are right, the foods edible, and it's close to where we live."
"""Try the soup. Service was quick. Food was great. Don't let this \""""hotel restaurant\"""" fool you. Give it a try"""
"Volcano Tea, now Volcano Cafe is a great hangout spot to go to with friends. Some days, the tea doesn't taste as good everytime. That being said I just enjoy coming here for the atmosphere. They'll play songs you request as long as they're pop or Korean!"
"Mineo's is in a league all its own when it comes to pizza. I'm not saying it's the best, but it's a very different slice altogether. \n\nMineo's is a sweeter pizza, with plenty of cheese and an always crispy toasted crust. There is an art to eating Mineo's when you order in--you can't eat it immediately. Wait a couple minutes for it to cool down, but not too long! Mineo's is at it's very best when eaten fresh. \n\nThis spot is always bustling, and the shop has recently taken over three full storefronts: a causal pizza parlor, an ice cream area, and restaurant/bar. There is a full bar in the restaurant, and beer in coolers in the other section. I was surprised how great the selection is! I've found some really hard to find stuff tucked away in the coolers.\n\nThe only downside to this spot is it's cash only, all the time. It's fine for a few slices, but can be tough if I want to grab a drink or entree. Not too much to complain about, always happy to snack on a slice."
"I have been a client of MPG Import Auto Service (Mike and Patrick) for over 15 years. They are very professional, they are honest, fair and trust worthy and the kindest people that I would want to provide a service for me. They take very good care of any one that I send to them. I will not recommend anyone else to service my car, my family or my friends'. They provide excellent service as if I were a family member or friend!\n\nRoberta Johnson (Howard's wife)"
My husband and I were in Vegas with friends and I love frozen custard.  So we looked up what was close and came here.  We went at night and the area looked kind of sketchy but we I am glad we got out.  The lady at the window was very helpful and answered all my questions.  I had their butter crunch and it was fantastic!  I have no idea what the crunch part was but it was sooo good.  My husband had one of their daily specials pumpkin.  I tried some and it was good but my butter crunch was better.  Lol.  Next time we go to Vegas we will be stopping by again!
"holy moley. it hasnt been since my treks out to tj have i found tacos this amazing.\n\nthe meat. moist and fatty, but not too fatty. just the right amount of fatty\n\nthe tortilla. surprisingly subtle\n\nthe salsa bar. oh holy salsa bar. one of the best hot sauces ive had a chance to taste. giant jalapenos. radish, fresh onion, cilantro, lemon. and the pickled onion...i would make the 4 hour drive from so cal to lv just for those pickled onions, whose hotness factor can pwn even the most experienced of taste buds.\n\nmust return one day for their soups, which you will often see mexican locals slurping down just about every time you visit. \n\nand the sinker? the workers only speak spanish. how much more awesome can that get? its like walking through tj all over again.."
"Pizza by the slice that's just as good as Ian's - and depending on your mood, sometimes way better. The options are more traditional American-Italian, and the ingredients are all pretty standard in terms of quality and creativity. But for the same cost as a specialty slice elsewhere, you can get a ridiculously huge slice that is a meal in itself.\n\nI get the baked ziti slice every time I come here and have yet to be dissatisfied. The texture of the pizza is especially unique - the crust is a perfect combination of soft and flavorful. Combine that with a sauce on the ziti that appears to be made from crack, and this makes one of the best fast-food Italian places in town.\n\nGyros ain't bad either, surprisingly."
"This place is an absolute institution in vegas. A throwback to when the west was all visions of Gene Autry and vegas was just long streches of dirt. In fact, my mom has been going there since the early the mid 50s when it opened. \nThe steaks, not surprisingly, are the reason to go for the first time and keep coming back. High quality meat simply cooked on a mesquite grill.  It is what modern steak houses try to emulate but usually just can't. The sides are not memorable but not terrible either. Still I make sure I go to Bob Taylors every time I'm back in Vegas."
"Awesome service, just had John here at my house. I called this morning expecting that I would have to wait a day or two, but they got me in today. John worked hard for 3 hours and I was very happy in the end. I will be calling them again when I need a plumber again, and have already given their info to my parents and brother.\n\nGive them a call, John will win you over."
"It's truly an amazing Wisconsin experience and one worth going to.  The interior is stellar - it's a converted farmhouse that is heavy on the wood with an eye catching bar when you walk in.  It's rustic without being too country and is the reason why it got an extra star from me.  The food, to be honest, was mediocre.  I had the pretzl batter fish fry, which was good, but not amazing.  The cheesy hash browns was a nice touch and definitely a plus on the dish.  I felt the need to dribble a little bit of hot sauce to counterbalance the cheesiness, but otherwise good.  Honestly, if you have the chance, it's worth stopping by for at least a drink and potentially a meal."
"My pick for #1 in breakfast. eggworks/egg and I is #2.\nI still have not tried dutch baby (sounds like too much sugar, I'm a meat lover) and always opt for gouda on my omelettes (it's awesome). Fresh tasty coffee, insanely good OJ,but expensive. \nI wish this place was open at night so I can get my evening breakfast fix on. Their pancakes are really fluffy and wonderful, I don't give a damn if it doesn't come with REAL maple syrup-still awesome, and I always will favor this place."
"""Lolo's is the result of vision, and putting your heart and soul into painting that vision on the canvas of reality. From the moment my wife and I walked in, we were immersed in the soul food vibe. From the kind hostess, to the music playing softly enough to hear, but still enjoy a conversation, to the walls covered in murals of family portraits, all the way to the food... Oh my, the food. Southern fried chicken and waffles, grits, collard greens, and sweet tea in a mason jar. As I ate, all I could think was, \""""Thank you, Jesus.\"""" The ONLY thing that was a little disappointing was the catfish, a little too thin and a little too dry. But the rest of the experience made it a single drop of rain on a sunny day. If you're ever in Phoenix and you love soul food, do not wait as long as I did to experience Lolo's."""
"This is my friends' and my go-to bowling alley.\n\nThey have the best deals I've seen. We went a lot on Sundays. It's $7 for all-you-can-bowl-in-2.5-hours. Mondays were $2 games and Tuesdays were $1 games. There were Groupon deals that frequently featured Schwoegler Park Towne Lanes as well. However, whenever they have bowling leagues or tournaments, there's a good chance you won't be able to get a lane. \n\nOh and shoe rentals aren't included in the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday deals I mentioned above. We went so much that we ended up buying a pair of our own shoes. I highly recommend that if you plan on bowling anywhere more than 5 times. You can get a cheap pair for $20."
"Good Thai food here.  Had laarb kai, chili mint, and pad Thai.  All great dishes and made very well.  I'm a bit surprised that their main competition is across the street, lotus of siam.  Well, food here is definitely good and worth a stop."
Great pizza.. I would prefer some other places over this one if were talking favorites but I do hit this place up at least twice a month.. Good stuff
"We didn't stay at this hotel but gambling here is great!! They have a ton of good places to eat and their machines actually pay out! The place doesn't smell too much like cigarettes and the staff is really nice! I'm definitely coming back here when I'm in Vegas!!! \nThey also have a kids section where they'll watch your kids as they have a blast in a huge room. They have a wii, iPads,  karaoke, and a jungle gym that I'd actually enjoy playing in!"
"Excellent tacos and freshly prepared tostadas, not premixed. The salsa wasn't too spicy and the aguas frescas weren't cheap fountain drinks. A bit pricey for a taco joint, but worth it."
"Have the smoked mozzarella ravioli which hit the spot. I was not super hungry so this was the perfect option. I was sat almost right away, thanks to making a reservation. The people ahead of us were told there was a 45 minute wait. I am glad I called earlier in the day. I saw some there menu item I need to try, so I'll be back."
"""My friend just had her wedding last weekend here- so you will need to ask her how easy it is to work with them.  For me, I thought they did a great job of coordinating everything.  All seemed to run smoothly.  I just took a peek at the pictures and they were very georgeous.  This is my first \""""Vegas\"""" wedding, but I felt it was very personal and we didn't run into too many other couples, even though they seemed to have a very tight schedule.  My only complaint would be that they wouldn't let us take any videos/photos in the ceremony.  They were very strict about it.\n\nEven though they wouldn't let you take pics, they had video cameras video taped the wedding so that they stream the wedding online- so all your loved ones that couldn't attend can watch it in real time.  I thought this was very cool!"""
"Love this place! Great atmosphere amazing steak (and super cheap on their late night menu). The drinks there are tasty yet strong...also their French onion soup is divineee. My only complaint is that service is slow for late night food. I haven't been there for regular dinner, so not sure how service it's during that. Definitely worth the wait though!"
"Gosh. I love this place so. damn. much! It really is an awesome place to go if you're downtown for whatever reason (or if you're a cosplayer like me) Seriously, they've got wigs of every kind, color, quality, shape... The list goes on! In fact, I'm wearing the wig I bought as we speak. The only problem I had was that the salespeople (or at least the one I checked out with) was a little, well, blah. She was obviously tired and it took away from the experience a little, but I'm still happy because she was still helpful. But, I just have to say, even if you're not planning on buying anything, you should still walk in and check out the big costume heads lined up on the wall."
"This place has gotten better since I last remember. The new staff members are very accommodating. I had a problem with my old apartment here and was deciding to move someplace that has a bigger floor plan. Then Cynthia caught my attention when she showed me the model home they're about to put for lease. It has a wonderful blue painting I wanted to keep, and its going to have new floors and carpeting. They really make you feel like family. Now I'm staying and making this my home for a while."
Went here for lunch. Not many young people were eating here but the atmosphere was great. I had the trainwreck sandwich. It was loaded with meat and the bread was freshly made. Everyone else in my party had a gourmet burger and everything was devoured. My husband said when his family comes to visit he will be taking them here.
I've come here a few times for drinks after school with a small group and it has always been great. I think I'd only eaten here 1x before though. A larger group of us came this weekend and had a phenomenal time. Everyone was happy with their food. NO complaints. I had the blackened chicken/goat cheese sandwich and it was actually blackened (unlike some places) the seasonings were amazing and so delicious. Everything was exactly how we ordered.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that we were seated and then told we had to move because another party had reserved the section. It wouldn't have been a problem had we been told that when we arrived. The least that could have been done was a free app.
"I wish this place had a drive through- but service is always quick and pleasant so I don't mind going in. The outdoor area is so charming. They never get the drinks wrong.  I can't say enough good things about the service- in particular there is one dark-haired woman that is so sweet, she makes me smile every time I go in."
Have used this company for several years to fix my personal appliances and the appliances in my rental units. They have always done a great job and have great communication with my tenants. They remember my name when I call and are always friendly. I have never had a bad experience with them.
"I've been here a few times, but each were too long ago for me to remember any details other than I was pleased and happy with each dish. I went this morning with a friend though, and it was terrific.\n\nI got one of the best smoothies I've ever had in my life from here (strawberry and banana with orange juice). Very creamy and smooth--none of the chunky icy texture either. The portions are small, but it's so good.\n\nI also got a buttermilk pancake and it was a pretty good pancake! Nothing phenomenal there, but it really hit the spot.\n\nI've never been disappointed with Sunroom, so if you're into healthier, good food at pretty cheap prices--well worth your time to examine and try out."
"Some of my favorites are the chicken parmesan, the chicken Bryan and the five cheese ravioli.  Also, I like that they have small and big portions.  My only complaint is that the tables in the booth are slanted.  \nOther than that, Carraba's is a good place for good food."
"Had live sea urchin.  Rice was overcooked but they quickly replaced it.  Food was awesome and staff are super friendly,,,"
Always good food & friendly service
"Holy crap on a cracker... The Bobbie sandwich is a little bit of heaven on a plate.  Perfect stuffing, the pulled turkey a fantastic touch, just the right amount of mayo and cranberry...\n\nHighly, highly recommended"
"I love this place--I would be there all day and night if I didn't have a job.  While it looks like every other neighborhood bar from the outside, I have more fun at the Keg than any place else in Vegas.  The bartenders are sexy, funny and way beyond uncensored--everyone has a good time!!!  Daily food specials are always tasty and affordable--Saturday's (and Sunday when football is over) $1.99 breakfast special is truly the best deal in town."
"I agree with the below poster.  I like Giant Eagle because they have everything someone needs.  They accept double coupons, have fuel perks, and are just the local grocery chain.  Sometimes a store is hit or miss depending upon the location, but I am satisfied with Giant Eagle and will do my grocery shopping there."
"Place is interesting they sing and interact with the customers...but you may wait a tad bit longer for things . Worth it nice employees, good vibe. Got a laugh when they embarrassed the fiance..."
"A restaurant unusual, everything is OK, the kitchen, the service and the atmosphere of a delicacy irreproachable, ravioli has hmmmm Truffle. N Let no dessert. We went to enter Friends, c was very nice. A The recommader, If you are in Chicago, he absolutely Made a visit, you will not be disappointed, c is very original"
"I have grown up in the neighborhood near the University Ave Sa Bai Thong and have eaten there more times then I can count. It's actually my favorite place in Madison, especially for Thai. I'm interested in the poor reviews they received, and hope anyone who had a bad experience would try it again.\nI do agree that sometimes service is a little slower but the staff is always soo friendly and the food is worth the wait. \nI have tried about 75% of their menu whether it was through my own ordering or tasting someone elses dish.\nThank you Sa Bai Thong for your delicious food!!! :)"
This place is pretty good. It reminds me a little too much of Tiki Lounge which is cheesy and the set ups are almost identical.\n80s night on Friday will not disappoint!
"What a nice place to shop for plus size gals.  Staff was friendly but not in your face.  Got some cute dresses for less than 25 bucks and they seem like quality goods.  They also had 25% off everything in the store, which was pretty cool since I went here on a whim.  They have  wide width shoes too, which is nice because they are pretty hard to find.  (At least non-ugly ones.)"
"Truth be told, the five stars is probably due to a bit of nostalgia kicking in, but I was one happy customer!\n\nWe don't have Roberto's in NorCal, which is a real shame.  I thought they were only in Southern California, and therefore was very happy to discover this one in Las Vegas, just a couple of blocks from our hotel.  When I was in college in San Diego, I used to hit up Robertos restaurants (and the other copycat taco shops, like Roybertos, Albertos, Alibertos, etc.) on a regular basis.  Cheap, greasy, delicious food was available at nearly all hours of the day.\n\nOn this visit, we picked up a couple of orders of rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, a quesadilla, and a couple of carne asada tacos.  The restaurant was incredibly clean, and the staffers were friendly, even at 10 pm on a Saturday night.\n\nThe food was just as good as I'd remembered.  I hope I run into another Robertos on my travels again soon!"
"Being the non traditional couple that we are I must say that I was thoroughly impresed with the beautiful atmostphere. The professionalism displayed by the staff was amazing. \n\nOur family and friends are on the east coast and outside of our parents and siblings; a lot of people were not able to come. I loved that our wedding was on the web with live streaming, so that people could watch and partake in our day.  \n\nThe wedding pics are sort of a passive aggressive sale. The staff wasn't horribly aggressive ... They let me select my pictures in peace. Tried to persuade me to buy the full package, but understood that my no was a no. \n\nI loved my wedding, love the photographs, loved my coordinator and my officiant."
"Wah Kee has the best wonton I've had in Madison. The milk tea is also super good - not very sweet, so be sure to ask for extra sugar unless you're like me and don't have a sweet tooth."

"""Disclaimer: this place gets 5 stars because I walked away with a free beer! \n\nMe and a buddy decided to go this \""""hole in the wall\"""" bar...drive by all the time and the name always catches my attention. We walk in and there's only 1 other customer inside and a female bartender. We ordered 2 beers and as she hands them to us my buddy hands her his credit card. The gentleman customer sitting a few chairs away chuckles and says to the woman bartender, \""""looks like you got some new warm bodies!\"""" we probably both looked puzzled and what seemed like a really long awkward pause between my friend and the bartender...she finally said no cards just cash. ATM is down..feel free to finish your beers and be on your way. Again the man chuckled. We chugged our drinks and headed to a bar that took credit cards.\n\nI went in a few days later and handed the same woman a $20 she seemed very happy but I dont think she remembered me haha"""
"I like to come here with my mom every once in awhile for breakfast, before she has to go to work. \n\nThe food is great (except sometimes its hit and miss). We always order the soybean milk, chinese fried donut (don't know what they are called), pork sung, fried donut wrapped in sticky rice, scallion pancake and sometimes my mom order others items but those are the basic we always get.\n\nThe service is eh but I don't usually expect good service in Chinatown anyways. lol."
"K&W can be a lot of fun if you're looking for comfort food. They cook like my mom and grandma...everything is southern, mushy, and well-seasoned. I love to get a sample of every vegetable on the line.\n\nIt's kind of reminiscent of elementary school cafeteria lines, which is always fun. The staff is very friendly and syrupy-sweet, which can be pretty nice. I think this is a great place to go if you're in the right mood for it. It can be a disaster if it's too busy or if you're not looking for a revisiting of your childhood days...especially when the place is really busy. Sometimes on Sunday afternoons, the church crowds can be overwhelming...but overall, it's a good, safe place for no-atmosphere and great food."
Consistently good food and service
"Wow, this place really hits on all cylinders!  Not only are the rolls fresh and creative they won't break the bank!  Not overly done with a bad ratio of rice to fish like some places, Sushi 101 really knows how to roll :)  I had a coupon for dinner and I've eaten lunch here a few times so I can realistically say I've never had a bad experience here.  The service is always prompt and polite and the drink specials always treat me right also.  \n\nDon't come here looking for insane, ecclectic interiors or a decor that is going to blow your socks off.  It's a simple place and it's simply delicious.\n\nLook online on their site for a coupon or two and pay attention to those drink specials.  $1 bottled domestics is pretty good if I do say so myself."
"""Husnus....definitely my \""""date place\"""" freshman year before I could a) afford anything else and b) get anywhere off campus.  On the first block of Street....this place is a great value.  $12 for salad and an entree.  I love the kabobs and anything with lamb in it.  The yogurt dressing is really good and the bread is very traditional.  Don't miss it, no matter how many much more expensive meals I have, I always return to this favorite. 5 stars."""
4.5-- really. Authentic southern fried chicken. Being from another part if the country I was a little lost looking at the menu. But ordered successfully. \n\nAnd had a great JUICY well seasoned chicken breast. Or a 1/4ofa3-1/2lb chicken sandwich. The way to go is the dinner. Because it includes hush puppies and potato rounds ( tater tots).  \nTake some time to absorb the atmosphere. And order a 1/2gallon of sweet tea yum !!
"This place is a daytime dive bar, gas station, TGIF on crack with Pabst signs and pinatas dangling from the ceiling.  The inside is stacked with snacks and coolers of any type of beer imaginable.  The beer selection is as affordable as a grocery store, with Kirin Ichiban 22ozs for only 2.50.  So, grab a beer and head outside to the back porch and paint on the benches or bring a laptop to write.  \n\nIt is a communal atmosphere with friendly guests who respect the joint.  It's easy to get lost in the view of urban decay with an Irish sized beer mug in hand, and the music is anything from Radiohead to The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.  Drop on in and drop out!"
"This is one of the best places to eat in the CU. The line for lunch is out the door and a little pricey, but it's very good. At dinner, the restaurant becomes full service and the lunch items go up in price, but there is a much larger menu. I never had much issue with the staff like other reviewers have mentioned, but I also haven't been in there for a while. If their lunch prices were a little less, I would give them 5 stars. The dinner prices are $12-$18, but seem fair for what you get."
"Stayed in a suite for a business trip. It's super convenient if you're going to an event at the Alliant Energy center, as the hotel is connected to the center. I can't comment on the price, since my company paid for it.\n\nThe room and bathroom were clean. The bed was quite comfortable. The suite is a good size, and has 2 TVs. The location is convenient. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast was nice, but not super. The sausage was yummy, and they had a waffle maker, toaster, and cereal. But the eggs were not very good.\n\nI couldn't find any restaurants nearby, and the hotel is not on a bus route, so eating out will probably involve a taxi if you don't have a car."
"""Brennan's is a great, family-owned specialty market. It is most similar to a whole foods or a trader joe's. The produce is probably their real specialty. The cheese selection is fabulous, but most of it is from Wisconsin so you are going to be missing some staple imports. Jacobson Bros takes up the meat section and they are decent, but they could probably use a wider range of meats. It would be nice to see some bison or more grass fed/\""""organic\"""" meat. Brennan's also has a lot of wine. All in all it is a good place to stop to prolong trips to a larger grocer."""
"I second Tara P's review and I think we stayed in the same clean room with the huge Jacuzzi/king bed and enormous windows. Better yet, we didn't notice the trains she mentioned and really enjoyed the downstairs bar back deck that some others mentioned was noisy, perhaps helping our DEEP sleep. Nice continental to hot breakfast downstairs at the Lakeview.\n\nSOLID well-done 1800's renovation included dipping and stripping the original doors and woodwork and duplicating the colors. The owner rehabbed an entire block including a German Restaurant the Essen Haus we also enjoyed, AND another bar the Come Back In we did not get to.\n\nVery convenient to the lake and capitol. Large free private parking lot and 2 free drinks in the Up North bar downstairs that had a huge selection of draft beers and a gorgeous 1890's cherry back bar, originally one of the longest in Madison including a nice back deck that let us sun. \n\nAll good. I can't imagine why you would stay somewhere else unless you crave higher prices, plastic trim and want to pay for parking."
NOTO! \nI was looking at the other cajun restaurants listed in Best of Madison for 2012 and this is the only one I've tried so far. But I have gone here many times and they are very consistent. Everything that I have eaten here was delicious. No let downs. Deb's bbq and whatever fish special they have are my favs; but also good are the etouffees (usually too spicy for me) and the crab cakes. \n\nTheir dirty rice (spicy) is usually a bit too much for me so I always ask for half dirty rice half white. \n\nThey are mostly a take-out place but they do have a bar area to eat in. I tend to like eating at whatever place I by my food from (I dislike take out boxes and my food cooling down) so it does well by me...I guess don't plan this as a first date type of place.
"Somewhat off the beaten path and not an easy find, but the sandwiches are terrific.  Exactly what you would expect out of a quality deli.\n\nThe variety in the menu is good and they are more than accommodating if you want to make any modifications.  Solid place for a hearty sammie."
"One of my co-workers took us here for lunch on a cold and nasty day for lunch. All I can say is that the owner really took care of us. The food was great.\n\nWe got some Cream Cheese ragoons which were out of this world.\n\nI don't know if was my mood, the weather or the food but this place really hit the spot.\n\nWas it great to look at??? NO!\n\nBut what really good Chinese places are?"
Love a store with a massage chair while I wait
"My family was headed back home but decided to get pedicures before we left town.  We found this place on Yelp. I have to say, after reading the reviews, I was skeptical. Boy am I glad we stopped! The service was excellent, the people were friendly, and even though there were 2 workers,  they serviced the 3 of us (my husband, 12 year old daughter, and I) in good time without us feeling rushed. The establishment was clean and clutter free. The pedicure was absolutely fantastic, complete with massage and hot stones! I can definitely come back again! It was a great end to a fantastic family vacation!"
"I have never had a bad meal here.  Everything looks and tastes homemade down to the green beans where you can tell they were cooked with just the right amount of salt, sugar, and bacon.  You really get the most bang for your buck here."
"I've eaten at roughly 20 of the late Gourmet magazine's Top 50 restaurants in the United States, and none of them exceed L'Etoile in terms of the quality of the food.  \n\nThe best time to go to L'Etoile is in late July or early August, when virtually the meal is derived from ingredients from the wonderful farmer's market right across the street. \n\nThe new location is even better than the old one, and unlike many other relocations, the food hasn't missed a beat.  It is worth the drive to Madison to eat here, and L'Etoile is easily my favorite restaurant...anywhere.\n\nL'Etoile also offers excellent demonstrative cooking classes on Thursday nights, but sign up early because they fill up very quickly."
"Bought three separate things shortly after moving here and had all good experiences. I shopped at three different mattress stores all on the same street and this had the best mattress for a reasonable price. The salespeople weren't pushy and annoying, but were helpful when I needed help. The mattress was delivered promptly and they were careful walking through the house with it.\n\nI picked up a dresser and a table from the store to assemble and both look great. The dresser had a slight problem with one drawer but steinhafels sent me an email the day I got it saying if I had any problems to fill out a form and they'd come fix it (no cost to me). I took them up on it and the guy came and fixed it quickly and was friendly and competent."
"This may still quite possibly the best place to have a cheesesteak...in Pennsylvania. Yes, we're in Pittsburgh here, not Philly. But these people get it right (no stinkin' cheez whiz!). The steak is cooked just right, the bread is delicious, and the fixins actually taste like something. Even more addictive than the sandwiches are the fries. I don't know what they do to them but they have that McDonalds-esque-nothing-really-special-here-but-actually-theyre-like-crack feeling. Really awesome.\n\nThe staff at both this location and the one down Forbes in Oakland are fast, efficient, and sometimes even funny.  But if you want a break from you college experience, go to this one up in Squirrel Hill. You'll see people from all walks of life, all ages, etc. \n\nPittsburgh has a LOT of unhealthy, greasy, delicious options. This is one of my favorites."
"Possibly the best pizza in town, and they deliver.  Lots of other stuff on the menu too.  Pizza is plentiful in college towns (Gumby's, Papa John's, etc.), but good pizza is a rarity."
"Love this place! I wasn't sure about it the first time, seeing that is in a strip mall, but like the saying goes don't judge a book by it's cover. \nI order the CHICKEN W/ GREEN every time and have not been disappointed. EGG ROLLS are wrapped in thin egg roll paper, spicy, & delicious. MANGO CHICKEN & CLAY POT DISHES are also excellent.\nIndependent & yummy."
"Always friendly, Always good, This place has never disappointed me.. good date place! *they had to close due to a fire, I hope they're still awesome when they open again."
Fast and friendly. The gyros actually taste like gyros. Although they don't fillem'  full of meat like they do up north. Their tender tips with onions and peppers is awesome. I always get filled up on the platter. Pretty good value and the people that work there are very nice and helpful.
"I just have to say that one of the employees of this store was very helpful. I forgot her name. She really did more than a hundred percent to really help me with my questions. I am sure that her fellow co-workers are the same when it comes to treating their customers. So I highly recommend this Best Buy store. \n\nFor sure, any business establishments definitely should have the best customer service no matter what kind of services or products they sell, and this store, exemplified by this employee, definitely is up there, so I give them the highest rating: five stars."
"Awesome.  I arrived at the restaurant a bit dehydrated, tired and spent from a day of running around.  The waitstaff got me some carbohydrate and an iced tea, stat.  Once I was feeling better, I had a spicy tomato soup (yum), an amazing chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and greens (yummier!).  Can't beat the ambience here, and the waitstaff is super attentive and sweet.  Love this place!"
"I'm glad I finally got the chance to eat here, as the food here is really tasty.  I had a vegetarian curry of some sort, which was delicious and extremely filling.  People with allergies/aversions to dairy, beware: There are eggs and peanuts in this dish, which is not something I found on the menu.  I was delighted by this, but just a heads up in case you're a vegan, or y'know, so allergic to peanuts that you'll die if you eat it.  :)\n\nI loooove the fruity drinks.  A friend of my boyfriend lives in Miami and says that the tropical drinks at Jolly Bob's are much better than the tropical drinks there.  Woohoo!  Also, they're so very, VERY alcoholic.  After two drinks, you might actually think you're in Jamaica. \n\nThe bummer?  No credit cards!!  In my opinion, this place is too expensive to not accept credit cards.  But whatever--it's one of the only places that I like too much for that to bother me."
"We ordered the steak and lobster special for $9.99. Great deal, we've been here several times and paid 3 times that amount for one dinner alone so it was quite a deal. The food was good, even though the portions were smaller because of the special. The place wasn't too busy and our server was still forgetful and rude at times. I don't know if we will be back any time soon."
"I have been coming here every 2 weeks for 4 years and never had a bad experience. The staff is polite, fast and very consistent. Its clean and eveyone is extremely nice. I have had Tawny dye my hair twice and she always does a great job and I get many compliments on it. Usually Bianca, John or Melanie cut my hair and they do an excellent job. I have never had a bad experience and I would absolutely recommend this place. If you need a color treatment, Tawny is the best but everyone is so nice and good at thier job!"
"Came in for hangover brunch. Was not disappointed (queasy and headache-y, but not disappointed). Great staff and great food at a reasonable price. Bit of a wait for your food but worth it. Cash only!"
Can I be a super fan even though I've only been twice\nand even though I got the same thing both times? \nB\u00fan g\u00e0 nuong xa \nIn other words... \ngrilled chicken over vermicelli noodles. \nIt's tasty. It's plentiful. It's cheap at lunch. It's quick.\nWhat's not to love. \nI do feel like I need to explore more of the menu before I can make this a five-r.
"Good food, reasonable prices, friendly conversation"
"Great service & FRESH food. I see some complaints about prices but sometimes you get what you pay for & this place is worth it. \nBest Mai Tai I've ever had,and you only need one."
"There is no other coffee shop/wine spot I love as much, unless it's the Barriques in Fitchburg. Morning or night, it has the perfect ambiance and great service."
"The Christmas Goose is a lovely little shop on the westside. I love the employees who are all very endearing. They have a great selection of civil war, reproduction, and country fabric. My only dislike is the lack of unique, bright colored fabric, but that is my personal taste. It is worth a drive across town."
"The Charlotte Humane Society is one of cleanest, most conscientious and most caring facilities I have ever been to. I adopted a puppy there over the summer and the thorough adoption process included finding out what sort of physical surroundings the puppy would be living in, my previous experience with the breed, speaking to my vet, and bringing my other dogs and my family in to interact with the new pup. They were not giving her to just anybody!\nWhat I got in return was a wonderful addition to our family who was already spayed, up to date on her shots, and receiving treatment for the worms she had when she was surrendered. The cost was $110 which is hundreds cheaper than I would have spent on the same services. \nPLEASE GIVE TO THE HUMANE SOCIETY!"
"Gimme them carbs.\n\nMadison Sourdough makes glorious carbo-loading a possibility in all forms, and I'm not speaking strictly bread. (Though the breads here are mighty fine. I'd recommend the Sourdough....)\n\nI adore the potato hash of yukon gold potatoes, onion, butternut squash and brussel sprouts, roasted beets, duck fat, and over easy eggs. Did I say duck fat? Yes, that just happened. \n\nThe shop itself is so inviting and is the kind of place you'd want to chill at for hours just sippin over a cup of tea or gnawing on a rustic baguette. Whatever tickles your fancy. \n\nPersonally, I'd go with the bread."
"Ah, the sweet, sweet aroma of burgers and ice cream in one. Such an aphrodisiac. \n\nEven though Mr. K's serves up some tasty burgers and fries, I'd much prefer to spend my time (and calorie allotment) on the sweet treats.\n\nMr. K's is such a Charlotte staple - an old school joint with greasy eats and amazing ice cream creations. Don't expect to grab ridiculously upscale and creative ice cream creations here. Instead, on the sugar front, Mr. K's serves up incredible milkshakes, soft serve and sundaes - the brownie sundae is my personal fave. It's a large portion of creamy vanilla soft serve with a sizeable brownie topped with a massive amount of chocolate and caramel sauce and whipped cream. \n\nThe employees here (especially the owner) are extremely kind and always seem very welcoming to each customer who stops by. Be sure you bring cash, as Mr. K's is cash only. I'm a big, big fan of Mr. K's and I'm always looking forward to my next cool treat from this famous ice cream joint just down the street."
"I absolutely love the staff and they level of service they provide here. Everyone is so warm, courteous, and accommodating. They have free hotel shuttle service to and from the airport, Epic and within a 3 mile radius of the place. \nKnock off one star for the facilities. The place is older and could definitely use some updating. All four times that I stayed, my room was pretty clean."
"My apple pancake was delicious!!  Waiter told me it might take a while because it's baked, but it came out pretty quickly. Service was good.  The bacon here is just bacon though, so all the great reviews on it are highly exaggerated."
"Among the hardest-to-find essentials for every woman are the perfect shade of lipstick, an amazing pair of black boots, and an honest mechanic. Finally, I've got all three!\n\nZovko Bros is a family-owned business that performs state inspections and general repairs. In fact they keep my 1995 Geo Prism running beautifully despite my often indelicate and irresponsible treatment of the poor, dear thing. I've gone there for my inspections for the past several years and for some major and minor repair work as well. Each and every time I could not have been happier with the results.\n\nI LOVE these guys. They are super nice and respectful, not intimidating, fair, and fast. They do GREAT WORK and they will not charge you and arm and a leg to do it. \n\nBecause they are located at the corner of 25th and Carson, you can kill time at the nearby South Side Works. So shop, eat, watch a movie - and one of the guys will call you on your cell when your car is ready. Write them a check and drive off into the sunset with your motor purrin'."
"We've been going to the Hong Kong Cafe for years.   Coming from Chicago where we've eaten in tons of different Chinese restaurants and are kinda spoiled, we were relieved to find a really good Chinese restaurant here in Madison and close by.  The service is good, very friendly and quick.  Great egg rolls - a true test of a good Chinese restaurant and the bathrooms are clean.  I always check a restaurants bathroom, if they're not clean, you can imagine what the kitchen is like.  Fabulous fried rice too, also another test of a good Chinese restaurant.  Ingredients feel fresh.\nHighly recommend."
"$5 bucks before 6pm on weekdays!? Count me in! This theater is tucked away behind other retailers like Target, Old Navy, etc. If the snack option prices bother you, a gas station is nearby. Nice seating too."
"I had my piercing done today by Ana & she is, by far, the best! I went to have my nipples re-done after 6 months without them. She found that my original piercings were off. She was excellent in sizing & helping me figure the right gauge. Now my piercings are damn near perfect in placement, size, & type of jewelery. I'm very happy with the service & professional manner that Halo provides. They even give you a card with all your piercing info so when you want to change, all you do is show them the card & they'll know what exactly fits you. I love it & highly reccommend Halo for anyone looking to get a body piercing."
I love everything about this place. Know the food good when you get to your car and you undo your pants and want to take a nap. Try everything
"Durst is a family bike shop that's been around forever.  They do a good job helping you select the perfect bike for your size and needs, and they'll do the tune-ups and other maintenance.  The prices might be a little higher, but the service is good.  Brands sold include Cannondale, GT, Raleigh, Schwinn, etc."
"Love the Range...great old Vegas vibe. The service is very good and they have a lounge act there most evenings. Many tables have a least a partial view of the strip. I've never had a bad steak there. The only thing I would pass on is the tuna. Their crab cakes are the best. Four of us split 2 apps, a salad, 2 sides, 2 entrees, a bottle of wine and we each had a cocktail. Check was $245 + tip and we all left very full! They also have a full bar where you can watch the game, but they stopped serving food there...boo - too bad as I used to love going there solo."
The atmosphere and decor is amazing.  I tried a few of their beers and I recommend the Celestial Gold.  Their food was only average but eating and drinking inside a real former church makes up for that.  Service was also.out of this world.  I visited on a weekday afternoon for a late lunch and had no problems.  The only minor gripe is that its too dark and at the bar there is.no TV or anything.and you are stuck looking at their serving tanks.
"Don't let the INCREDIBLY sketchy-looking exterior fool you, this place is great. I love the pain killer and their other deliciously wonderful drinks. The dance floor never fails to bring a wide variety of people. Just watching people dance is enough entertainment for the night! I've never been disappointed in a night at jolly bob's...and kinda miss it now that I live in Chicago!"
"""Agree with the other reviewers.  Very \""""hotel restaurant\"""" interior, but don't let that turn you off because the food is super yum!\n\nI got the shrimp po' boy and holy moly it was big and packed such a punch of flavor.  Shrimp crispy, spicy remoulade extra zingy and hoagie crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Love! \n\nI'm also a huge fan that the fries are beer battered which spiced up your normal fries on the side thang.  \n\nThey have a great Yelp check in offer.  Buy one beer get the other free.  Score!"""
"Really nice place!  My filet --medium rare -- was delicious!  My husband said his could have used more flavor, but that's his own fault for ordering it medium well!  The asparagus side was a little small, and a bit overcooked.  Baked potato was perfect!  Loved the bread assortment they brought out!  French onion soup was good but think the fresh herb they added overpowered the other flavors.  Nice wine selection--gosh I hate paying quadruple the wine store price, though!  Bring back BYOB!  Nice staff and loved our cozy booth--made the din not so overpowering and we could hear each other without yelling!  Really, really yummy steak, but it should be for $33.00!!!"
I found this boba store on a whim when I was going to Ranch 99. Went in to get a quick drink and got Jasmine Milk Tea for only $3 total. It's consider cheap when you compare the price to Tea Station. So I always go here when I have some extra cash in my wallet.
"I take my baby to see Dr York. Although he looks young (mid 30's?) he is an awesome doctor and knows what he's doing. I always book the first appointment of the day if possible as they do have about 6 doctors on staff so the rooms do fill up quick in the middle of the day. The one late appointment I had to make after work only resulted in a 20 min wait in the waiting room. They play childrens movies on the tv's in the waiting room and have a childrens toy for the toddlers to stand around and mess with. If you do have a medical question for the doctor you do have to leave a voice mail and they return your call within 24 hours. If I call in early enough in the morning I usually get a response that day. \n\nI highly recommend this office. \n\nParking sucks, but the office has no control over that as its on hospital grounds."
"I was on vacation in Las Vegas, and I wanted a break from the over priced food in the strip so this place was a much needed break. At first I was a little skeptical, but wow this place was delicious and the staff was very friendly! The proportions are huge! I ate the best pancakes I've ever had, no syrup needed. Overall, the next time I'm in Vegas, the Omelet House will be #1 on my list!"
"These guys know there stuff, great advise, not just looking to sell more, but really educate you on the options.  Highly recommend this be your first and only stop when game, console or add on shopping !"
"""Great atmosphere. Perfect sushi restaurant for after work drinks and a quick bite. The location on South Boulevard is nice and yet parking is still OK. The sushi is not cheap, but the quality and art of sushi is what you expect from a high end sushi restaurant. I am not an elitist so I prefer the cool atmosphere with the quality in the food. If it were more stuffy or \""""quite\"""" I would not like Nikko as much.\n\nAlmost my fav spot in Charlotte, but definitely up there..."""
This is a little blink-and-miss-it place in Central Phoenix.  Don't be scared of how it looks on the outside...\n\nYou have to try the green chile burro.  Absolutely amazing!
"My 13 year old daughter finally wanted her ears pierced and we went to SADU to get it done. I called first to get the info on minor procedures and the person on the phone answered all of my questions. Our piercer, Cindy, explained every step to her as well as talked in depth about aftercare. We will go back for any other piercing needs."
"""Hello Friends,\n\nI like his store. It's quick & to the point. I watch \""""Good Eats\"""" with Alton Brown and he goes to BB&B in his shows. I had a gift card from our wedding that we needed to use. We needed a new lamp for the living room. We walked around for a few and picked up a nice lamp. Got it home only to discover the \""""Bulb INCLUDED\"""" bulb was Not included. But that's not BB&B fault. \n\nEveryone is very very nice and helpful!!\n\nTTFN"""
Really good track. It was in fantastic shape. 3:20 round. The place was empty. Call day before and u should be able to make a deal for a better green fee
"Absolutely loved going there. The food was awesome, the waiter was funny, and the atmosphere was very cool. We heard great stories about the clubs hay day. We also heard about the ghost that haunts the club. I would highly recommend going there. Don't be surprised if your food comes out in shifts because the kitchen is small and they want to get the food right. It's well worth the wait. If you do go ask, to have Joe as your waiter he is a riot. He looks like an Elvis impersonator, side burns and all. This was my first trip to Vegas, and when I go back this will defiantly be a stop."
"Always great service. They are willing to work with you and find exactly what you are looking for. If they don't have it they get it. Great store, great prices, great service. I continuously use this store not only for costumes but for decorating too."
Was In Vegas and My daughter need her Accord given a once over (it had been almost 2 years since) I met Dan and he was fantastic! The gave the car the once over bumper to bumper and made a list of things that needed to be done should be done and those that could wait. The work was done in a day (had a full major service) and other then the fact I hate parting with $1 from my pocket the job and professionalism were wonderful. Thanks to Dan and the team that will take care of my daughters car going forward.
"I enjoy getting a large cup of jasmine milk tea with egg pudding here at Volcano Tea House, and not feeling guilty about spending that money.  The service is really fast.  My fiance got the avocado smoothie with boba.  I must say, I have always hated getting boba because it's not the soft yet chewy texture that I like...these  bobas were nice and chewy.  \n\nThis place also sells hot snacks, like the taiwanese style chicken nuggets, and also other items which would go great with your drink."
"""Well the sushi is great! I get sushi from Mandarin about 3 times a week. It is by far the best sushi in the city. As for the food? Yeah there are better places in CHINA. I can only imagine what these people say about \""""TYPICAL\"""" Chinese places because this is GREAT compared to other Chinese restaurants."""
"Borders is infinitely better than Barnes & Nobles simply from the fact that their return policy isn't crap. Walking in brought back good memories from college - maybe it was the smell of Seattles Best coffee....awesome frozen coffee drinks by the way.\n\nI don't know if its new, but I like that they sell mini Lindt chocolate bars here by the register."
"Hands down the best pizza in North Shore. I choose Georgios every time when I get a pizza craving. No delivery and cash only doesn't bother me, and if you want a good pizza it shouldn't bother you either. My favorite is good old pepperoni. They use the little pepperoni slices so they curl up and the grease pools in the middle mmm mmm! This is the way pizza should taste! A+ \n\n-Review by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and myself."
"Alright. Bluberry Hill Round 2.\n\nThe first time I ate at Blueberry Hill I was pleasantly surprised by the portions and yummyness of the food.  This time it was all about living up to expectations.\n\nI went with my pops and bro.  We stopped by for some grub before dropping me off at work and they continued up to the Bay Area.  I think I over hyped Blueberry Hill to my bro because he wasn't nearly as estatic about the place as I was.  Then again, he ordered meat loaf.  WTF!  Order breakfast at a breakfast place damnit.  Though, I guess he's not much of a breakfast food person.  I, on the other hand, love breakfast food and I ordered the Wild West omelet.  Hm, I think I liked the Combo omelet I ordered last time better. Yet, the Wild West omelet definitely has a purpose.  It filled me up and had reserves for a small snack while I was at work.\n\nI'm still enjoying Blueberry Hill but more testing much be done."
They are great. I have gotten to know the young ladies that work there. They will sew a button on if I need them to. When all my clothes are done they will call and let me know that I can come and pick my clothes up. They do nice things for me.\nProbably the best place for dry cleaners if your in the nightclub industry!
"I have lived here for over a year, this place is now under new management and have done a great job taking over. Very friendly and helpful office staff. Anytime I've had an issue with a maintenance error, it's always fixed within a reasonable time."
"A solid fried chicken establishment.  Despite the long lines, service moves fast.  A good value with local flavor.  I ordered the meal with chicken, hush puppies, coleslaw and tater tots.  The chicken is very crispy and well-seasoned.  Personally, I like a little heat and spice, but this was very good (and greasy).\n\nThe sweet tea is WAY too sweet for me, but then again, I'm from the west coast, so sweet tea is a foreign concept for me to begin with."
"Since Cabo's changed their menu features, I'd have to say Phat burritos offer the best fish tacos in town."
I love Aladdins.  Everything is always so fresh and good.  Prices are more than reasonable and service is good.  I love the Greek Pitza and the hummus pockets.  The Lentil Soup is great.  I don't care for their desserts; they're very dry.  THis is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Be prepared to wait on weekends and dinnertime.
"Easily and definitely one of the very best.  First, the staff: Professional, courteous, and most responsive when things come up.  The ladies in the front office know what they are doing, and do their best to accommodate everyone as best they can.\n\nNow, Dr. Garhardt is simply on an entirely different level that other Doctors.  Yeah, that's right, I said Doctors, not just dentists! His demeanor and level of caring and concern truly reflect the kind person that he is, and does what he does because he cares.  The dental assistants and hygienists walk the same path.  Always concerned, thorough, and caring.\n\nOver the years, I've referred quite a few friends and family to Dr. Garhardt, because I knew they would be taken care of properly. I've not had a single person I know have ANY issue. \n\nThe only tough thing, so to speak, is the bar this Doctor sets for other physicians, regardless of field and practice!"
"Hello, alcohol empire!\n\nRiley's has an amazing selection and a lot of great quality booze. My significant other really prefers this place to the other available places near the campus and I like coming here as well.\n\nThis place is the best for variety, but service here is mediocre at best. However, there's only things you can find here compared to Miller's or the OP, and they know it, so it's a little pricier."
Had huge problems with my insurance.\nKenny in the pharmacy made a ton of phone calls and went above and beyond.\nI have severe back problems and without his help I would have been back to the hospital.
"I theeenk they offer a variety subs? Unfortunately, I've not been able to order anything else since discovering The Bobby about 10 years ago."
"This place was tasty and rich, and it seems like a good place to visit especially when it gets cold outside.\n\nI had the vegetarian combination platter, and it came with samosas, momochas, roti, and dal. Overall, it was pretty good. The samosas and roti were particularly good, and the momochas could have been a bit more flavorful. I will probably try the momos if I go back. \n\nThe main reason this place lost a star was the portions for the price. The meal sizes were perfect for me, but I generally eat very small meals. The average person may be left wanting more than just one entree. Perhaps adding a side would make it a larger, better suited meal. Also, if you don't feel like going vegetarian, be prepared to pay over 15 per entree. \n\nOverall, I would come back. This was my first time trying Nepali food and it was really good. I want a stack of that roti for my breakfast every day."
"After riding up the incline and taking some pictures of the beautiful Pittsburgh skyline, I walked over to Redbeard's to grab some grub. I wasn't overly hungry, but when I noticed the deep-fried dill pickles on the menu, I knew I had to try them. I've eaten various appetizers like this before, but they were always sliced pickles. Not here. You're getting the whole spear, which I thought was much better. Add a couple of pints of Dogfish 60 min IPA, the NL beating up on the AL in the All-Star game and baseball debate with gentlemen at the bar and I had myself a very enjoyable evening."
"Totally, utterly and completely a fan.  Van and I needed furniture, so of course we scoped Ikea and Good Will and then wanted to check out this place.  \n\nBill is awesome, clad in a cowboy hat, cowboy shirt and jeans he is definitely a discerning eye for style.  His store is PACKED with furniture; everything from couches, chairs, chests, to stuffed animals, (literally- taxidermy style) and cowboy boots. So much awesome in one place.  I literally didn't know where to look first.  \n\nIt's a bit of a challenge to find things, since the store does not seem organized, also nothing is priced.  But we found a chest that we could not live without and were flabbergasted at the price, (in a good way.)  We both literally thought that it would be $100 more.  Pittsburgh definitely had some amazing retro and vintage finds.  \n\nAnyways, we will DEFINITELY come back to Bill, he was incredibly helpful, polite and friendly.  Loved it!"
"It doesn't get any better than this. Sunday morning wait time for a party of 8 was only about 25 minutes. The scent of those heavenly waffles and crispy fried chicken was wafting through the parking lot and waiting area, driving us nuts! We tried just about everything again this morning sharing deliciously crispy fried chicken that was moist and tender; flavorful waffles with lots of butter and maple syrup; coarse ground grits that are just this side of perfection; sweet candied yams with enough brown sugar to melt your bitter away; green beans with just a touch of spice and some red potatoes; and that velvety banana pudding. Oh my land! Service from Chris and his crew was some of the best we've ever had. Keep it up Lolo's and we'll keep coming back again and again and again."
"Fantastic experience here. Very friendly waiter. No MSG in their food, which is huge to me. It does not need it, anyway. We had the green curry and it was great. Also ordered the Herbal Salad, which was recommended here by several yelp'ers. It was very lemongrass-y, which was good for a few bites, but I could not eat a whole plate of it. My husband had no problem eating a good deal of it, though. The coconut milk curry was great. We also ordered the mango with sticky rice dessert, as well as the fried banana with homemade coconut ice cream. The ice cream is to die for. best I've had in a while-- and homemade! :)  Mango sticky rice was wonderful, too, and I haven';t found many places that make it with coconut milk only instead of sweetened condensed milk. So happy to find a vegan version!"
AWSOME AWSOME AWSOME I was scarrrrreeeedddd to death and the nurses calmed me down I remember dr.moxley talkin to me next thing I knew I was on my way home they are wonderful treat you like family ......
"The atmosphere and decent brews make this place worth a visit.  It just looks great, and the beers, while not the best, are good and inventive. Mint-milk stout? Not my favorite, but I love the attempt. \n\nBeer prices are decent too.  I'd recommend coming in here and grabbing a drink or two at the bar.  There is one TV, but this is a more relaxed, family and/or dinner atmosphere.\n\nThe food is hit or miss.  The 7 onion soup is awesome, but at $4.50 a cup, it better be.  The pizza are pretty good, made in a wood fired oven.  The crust comes out doughy, but not too thick.  I had the chicken and chorizo pizza, it came out with huge chunks of chicken breast and a tiny dusting of the smallest pieces of chorizo I've ever seen.  The service was really slow all around here; took a while to get both drinks and food.  Far too long considering it wasn't even crowded when I visited.\n\nBottom Line: It's a cool place that warrants a visit. There are some good beers, but expect slow service."
"""Dive Bar: A dive bar is a type of bar or pub.\nDive bars generally have a relaxed and informal atmosphere -- they are often referred to by local residents as \""""neighborhood bars,\"""" where people in the neighborhood gather to drink and socialize. Individual bars may be considered to be disreputable, sinister, or even a detriment to the community.\n\nTommy's Pub may not be some people's idea of fun, but if you are a fan of dive bars, Tommy's is a masterpiece.  I had one friend say he liked it because he is always the youngest one there and he is early 40s.  Tuesday is vinyl night, you can bring in your vinyl records and they will play them for you on their state of the art turn table.\n\nWe went in one afternoon, drank a couple of beers and listened to George Jones and Johnny Cash.   It's so fun to walk out of a dimly lit bar and being blinded by the sun. Feeling the sun on your face with a happy little afternoon buzz.  If you go in be sure to buy your membership, it's a private club."""
Say what you will about the place but I am happy to pay my entry fee to eat the frybread tacos at Angelina's. I never miss stopping for one when I am in Phoenix. I am sure there are 100 places in Phoenix to get good frybread tacos but this one is kind of a tradition for us.
"gotta love andrew carnegie's outlook on life:\n\n    * to spend the first third of life getting all the education one can.\n    * to spend the next third making all the money one can.\n    * to spend the last third giving it all away for worthwhile causes.\n\nnot sure i'll make as much as he did, but i'm certainly trying to make as much money as i can these days...\n\nregardless of what stage of life you're in, this is an amazing library and has something to offer to anyone."
"Good food, good people and good prices.\n\nHey, this is a pub not Delmonico's . That said the sandwiches are very good, the beer is cold and the service is fast and friendly.\n\nFor a good meal with the buddies this place is great."
amyone that lives in vegas knows this is the best cheap asian buffet in town.
"Good quality Italian for the State St. area. Comfy booths (there's also outdoor seating), nice decor, good weekly lunch specials. I can't really say much else that would separate them from a typical Italian restaurant. Good deals on wine; liked their house wine. Enjoyed the olive oil they served with their crusty bread."
"If you're looking for some FAST authentic,  old-school, old-Phoenix style Mexican food in Central Phoenix, this is the place.\n\nWalk in.  Look up at menu. Go to the counter.  Order.  They hand you a drink-- they brew their own tea, you can get a beer, soda, whatever.  Pay.  Sit.  Oh So Fast, they'll call your number and you walk up and get a cafeteria style tray with your order.\n\nMini bean burritos on the lunch plate- yum!  Awesome cheese crisp with guacamole!  Fast. Cheap.  Good choice!\n\nNo real ambiance, but that's OK, you're not there for the faux finished walls and water feature anyway."
"When in the mood for some great thai food, this is the place. I have sensitive stomach and never had an issue here. And food taste awesome. slightly higher price then other thai , but well worth it."
"I had the experience that I'm sure a good majority of people have here in that I was recovering from being awake for two days straight taking in all of Vegas has to offer. I was visiting a friend in Vegas and he had no hesitation in choosing a spot to eat.  Upon arriving I was struck by the down-home feel to this restaurant. I ordered the Farm-Fresh Sausage Omelet and a side of 3 pancakes. It goes without saying that these were the 3rd best pancakes I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I say 3rd, because there are better pancakes in this country but I truly believe they have the best ones in Vegas. For insight into who has even better ones check out the rest of my reviews! Overall, a great experience and a wonderful place for recovery. Don't even consider Denny's!"
"Came in today looking for some body spray, a feather extension for my daughter, and what ever goodies i could treat my self to. when i walked though the door I was greeted by about 5 different people how nice. The store is pretty big and the layout is nice ever thing is clearly labeled and easy to find. I head over to the sprays and lotions only to find out the one I want is sold out. Then I head over to the hair products again feathers are sold out. One of the sales ladies was kind enough to look up orders to find out when more will come in. This week! Good news. So even if both items were sold out they were nice enough to look up shipping orders for me. Left without but all in all I was happy with the customer service so I will absolutely be back later this week!"
"I've been here for two things: An overnight stay, and a wedding.\n\n1) The rooms are really lovely, much prettier than I ever would've expected.  I'm always taken aback by hotel rooms that aren't decorated with those tacky shades of bright green, coral and tan.  This had a pleasant ivory/gold and navy blue color scheme.  The bed was very comfortable.  Everything seemed very clean.  The staff was friendly upon check-in/check-out.  The only problem was that the walls were incredibly thin and we could hear everything that was being screamed down the hallways by drunks at 3 a.m.  \n\n2) My friend's wedding reception that was held here was lovely.  A member of the waitstaff noticed that a friend of mine had spilled her water all over the table and mopped it up before we could even ask for a towel.  Most of the service was great like that, except for a mixup with some of the entrees--but that was corrected immediately upon our request."
"This place is great.  It is SUPER dark as most of the reviews mentioned but that does not bother me.  I had a fillet that was cooked perfectly.  I also like that the steak came with a side and a salad.  Christopher was our server and he was really great.  Friendly, funny and comfortable.  If I am ever in Charlotte again, I will definitely be eating here!"
You usually can't go wrong with a place that has Birdsong on draft. This is definitely your stereotypical hole-in-the-wall dive bar but that is absolutely what makes it awesome. I visited this place for a fund raising karaoke event and had a blast. The drinks are a good price and there was a good group of 21 - 35 year olds belting out their favorite 80s tunes with a beer in the other hand. The staff there is super friendly and the entire atmosphere makes you feel like your in your best friend's basement for a house party.
"Great place to eat, large portions and the prices are so low it's ridiculous. The steak and lobster specials, breakfast and burgers are delicious. The service is great. You don't have to ask for a refill or even have to ask for a stack of napkins (they beat you to it) Lol"
"Grew up in Charlotte and moved away 31 years ago. Now, whenever I get within 2 or 3 hundred miles I will make the trip back to eat at South 21. I nearly always have the Jumbo Cheeseburger with massive amounts of the delicious onion rings. I was just there in late Sept, and they still do not disappoint. The onion rings were crispy, the cheeseburger juicy and now that I am back in Florida, I regret not eating dinner there that night also.\nI have on occasion tried the Trout or the Chicken and they are also good,but as far as I am concerned it is the Jumbo Cheeseburger that has made them a staple in Charlotte for over 50 years and it also my favorite. They also have a sit down restaurant in Matthews that is a bit far depending where you live but easier to get in to than the one closer to town.\nmarty b"
"If your looking for some old school frozen custard, you have hit the mark with Luv-It !!! The custard that comes out over here is always smooth and silky, and has a great mouth feel to it. Since this is a small mom and pop operation there is only about 3 different flavors a day, and be warned that the popular ones go out early. There are over 15 different types of sundaes that you can create, but I think the best for eating is just a plain scoop in a waffle cone. I would agree that this is not in the best part of Vegas, but rest assured you will not be alone there at night as there always seems to be a crowd of 5+ at any time of night."
I'm a fish taco junkie and this place is my Graceland! I haven't tried the majority of the menu because they always have multiple daily specials and it's hard to pass them up. I usually sit at the bar which has a great selection of brews and an always pleasant tender which adds to the laid back vibe!
Great hole in the wall bar.  The atmosphere is inviting and not your typical Charlotte cookie-cutter crowd.  Places like this are the heart of Charlotte.  You will not see any pink polos here!  Go here if you are looking for a stiff pour and some authentic greasy bar food.
"Great local bar - yet on the main drag in South Side.  The wings are my favorite in the burgh.  Actually, all of there food is good (I still need to try a fresh gyro from here).  The service is awesome.  They make you feel at home.  Also, it would be hard to find lower prices for drinks on Carson.  The only negative I have is smoking is still allowed in the bar area.  Most of the time you cannot tell, but occasionally it's annoying for a nonsmoker."
"This place is absolutely gorgeous inside and the food matches it! Great food,BUT pricey. I would have given it five stars if it weren't so expensive."
This place was pretty good. I had never been to one of these (Franchise). But its setup pretty cool. You pick a serving size. type of noodle and protein to add and they cook and serve. The prices weren't bad at all either. There were a lot of people ordering the Wisconsin mac and cheese I may have to try that the next time. Id definitely go back.
"Thank you to the southwest staff. From the check in to triage to treatment everyone was friendly, helpful and most of all quick. I was in and out in an hour. Special shoutout to Ed he made a very unpleasant event much more bearable thank you again!"
"Good people ,good car wash,good price,it took about 30min not bad good for me ; )... cashier very friendly. . Clean location.. Thank u"
"I have been a fan of this store for years but never thought of it as more than just liking the product itself.  I had the best experience with an associate Denise.  Not only was she helpul, she was sincere and smiled as if he truly enjoys her job and establishing relationships with her customers.  This particular store is out of my way but i will go back because of the customer service.  A+"
"The pizza was good, but not exceptional. The crust was fair, the sauce was excellent. The price was $18 for a large pizza. Considering the quality price and everything else, I rate it four stars.\n\nI would go one more time.\n\nSauce was very good."
"Love this place for Chiefs games.  We wander over to this side of town for just about all of them.  The bartenders are awesome and remember who you are and what you drink after your first time there.  The owners and staff from their other bars are often here too and are nice as can be.\n\nThey don't really serve food, but there will often be some random potluck servings or pizza ordered in for the football games.  And they don't mind a bit if you bring in your McD's from across the parking lot.\n\nThe token minus one star is primarily for how overtly smoky the place is.  It is your typical corner dive bar though, so it's not too surprising.  Just plan to change clothes after a few hours there."
"Luisa's has amazing pizza.  This place might get overlooked because it is in the back part of a little shopping area on Montford, but if you have been overlooking it you have been missing out.  The pizza here is traditional Italian style (as close as you'll get in Charlotte) and the owner is a wonderful Italian woman named Luisa.  When I was a kid my favorite thing in the world to eat was garlic bread with cheese and marinara sauce on the side- it's simple but delicious (they have great sauce) and it's the size of a small pizza, so it's plenty of food."
"Wahhhhhhhhh!!!! I found the da vang near Laveen! OKAY before you bash my review, that was a compliment!!!\n\nEvery pho places I have been to, are lower standards than DA VANG superior food flavor. Let me say that this place surpasses that and it's has that da vang flavor too in some of their food:)\n\nThis just became my number 1 pho place!!!"
There's just something about a firehouse Italian fully involved sub and Backdraft hot sauce accompanied by a Barq's vanilla root beer that really hits the spot on a cold winter day.\n\nThe sub was hot and delicious. I don't know who crafted it but they did a great job. It was nice and messy. Firehouse is definitely the place to be on a cold day.
"It's a small place but a good one. I always find something to buy everytime i come here. It's really cheap too. Lastly, the employees are really friendly and will even escort you to your car if you have a lot of stuff."
"We were starving when we had arrived at Marigold Kitchen, which came at a recommendation from our friend who lives in Madison for breakfast. Our timing was good as after we ordered the line was out the door even with the 100+ degree weather.\n\nI dig the concept of ordering your food then grabbing a table. \n\nWhen I got to the cash register I ordered a staple - eggs, potatoes and bacon with a side pancake. Eggs and bacon were good though the potatoes were amazing. They were scalloped, salted and crispy on the edges. The pancake was fluffy and big with some strawberries and butter and syrup -not bad for an extra $2.\n\nI would go back if I were to visit Madison again though my only gripe was that my food was warm and the others were cold, which was surprising given that the food is made and served to order."
"I really do love this place.\nWhen I was in school at least, they had decently cheap deals on Tuesdays, a large cheesesteak and fries for like $6, normally $9. At one point I scheduled myself around when I would go here on Tuesdays.\nOne day I was passing through the MSP airport and saw it in the foodcourt for the briefest of moments but couldn't stay (and it was 6am), deeply disappointed.\nAlways go back when I go to Madison, really good for a basic chain!"
"After being dropped off in the South Side and striking out at a couple of other bars, we finally found our spot for the night at Lava Lounge. What can I say, this place is just downright awesome. There was no cover, the drinks were cheap, the music was loud, and I mean come on, the place looks like a cave. How cool is that?\n\nThat being said, it can be a pretty confusing place inside once you have a few drinks in you, especially if you have never been there before. They keep it pretty dark and for me at least, it got a bit disorientating. Then again, I had been drinking, so who knows how much that came into play. \n\nAll in all, Lava Lounge was a shining light in an area overrun by bro bars, and if I ever find myself in Pittsburgh again, I will be sure to make a trip to the South Side and visit this Fraggle Rock-esque bar again. Dance you cares away! Worries for another day!.."
"My mom and I came here one night and probably tried every cocktail they offer in one sitting.... Here is my sober review:\n\nFavorites: cucumber martini, dirty w/ belvedere (blue cheese olives), the last coffee cocktail on the menu, one of the guys even ensured our cocktails were constantly in an ice cold glass -- that's what I'm talking about \n\nService & management is great\n\nSeasonal tuna salad w/ quinoa was perfect"
"I first started frequenting Chinese groceries in the early 90's in Minneapolis, MN, because that's where my Chinese Doctor had his practice.  There are some incredible grocery stores and pharmacies there, and in other large cities.  Compared to those, Asian Midway foods would earn 3 stars from me.\n\nThat said, this is Madison.  The store offers a decent selection of Asian foods.  It's in a poorer part of Madison and that is reflected by the clientele and the condition of the store, itself.\n\nBut, why are you reading this?  Probably because you need something that only a Chinese grocery would likely be able to offer.  Or, perhaps you are just curious.  You should definitely come here.  I buy teas, treats, and Chinese Medicine here.  The staff have always been friendly and helpful.  You'll get a decent sense of the types of things you'd find at larger, more established stores.\n\nI can't speak much for the actual grocery selection because I haven't done any grocery shopping here.  Will update when I have time to check them out more."
"This AMC location is right on the end of Concord Mills Mall. They have automated box office in front of the ticket counter, if you have one of those AMC cards you can get your tickets without waiting in line most of the time.\n\nThe theater is pretty neat and clean; the few times that I have been inside I never had the sticky shoes feeling. They also have quite a few number of theaters so it can actually accommodate popular new releases. Drinks and popcorn and snacks are bit overpriced, but isn't that the same with any other theater?\n\nOverall, not a bad experience at all every time I have been."
"Always top notch service! Joey has always designed such what I've imagined! And the quality of the jewelry is the best, I'm rough on my jewelry and nothing ever breaks!"
Dr. Earl and his staff made my (very much feared) trip to the dentist surprisingly pleasant. I'd highly recommend visiting Dr. Earl's office for any issues you have with your teeth.
"Perhaps the closet thing Madison has to a small town supper club, the Avenue is home to the best traditional Friday night fish fry's in the city.  Sure, it was only cod but it's light and tasty and not overly greasy.  Add a brandy old fashioned and some variety of fried appertizer and it's about as Wisconsin as you can get.\r\n\r\nMake sure to get reservations.  This place is hopping on a Friday night."
"I have lived in this complex for going on 6 years and with in that time it has gone through several management companies. However, this new company that has been on the property for just a few months, is doing a great job. I have noticed some very nice changes around the complex that makes me feel safer and happy to call Sterling Court Apartments not just a place to live, but a place  I call home. I have met the new management team Mrs. Ally and Mrs. Brenda and they are very very nice and friendly. Maintenance request are taken care of in a timely manner and the jobs are done right the first time. Keep up the good work and look forward to many more years here."
"""Their seafood gumbo was great!  Granted the portions were a little small...I got the cup which contained 2 (or 3 I can't remember) shrimp and 1 oyster, but they were delicious!  Very tender, not overcooked and hard like most places that do seafood and the price was great too, I think it was something like 4.95.  I'm only detracting a star because their \""""french bread\"""" wasn't really french bread, it was dry and crumbly and not very good.\n\nStaff was super friendly in making the recommendation."""
"""Vientiane Palace is great as a lunch location (it'd probably be good for dinner as well). Portions are fairly large. The spiciness is something you can ask to specify with many dishes. While I've one one or two occasions had something that turned out more mundane than I expected, usually the food is excellent. I concur with Sarah that the service isn't bad, just \""""business-like\"""", although I confess I've never eaten here with a guest, just by myself. Which doesn't mean anything, since the food's good enough that I'd recommend to anyone who generally likes Southeast Asian cuisine and wants to try something new."""
"It's good to catch this place at 12:00pm because all the early birds got the left over broth from yesterday and by noon the new batch gets cooked. OMG I am just kidding!!!! \n\nI like the Pho here a lot. The broth is clear, flavorful, and oh so yummy after a long night of ??. \n\nI was so hungry, I ordered spring rolls, egg rolls --these two are not that great. I had Pho in a small bowl with meatball was about $7. I love it. \n\nThis place is very busy for locals and out of towners. It just feels like home."
"""Great jambalaya and po'boys!\n\nQuick service, affordable prices, and a fairly diverse menu, and you have a recipe for the best Cajun/Creole you'll find outside of \""""Nawlins.\"""" I always order their jambalaya, which is a chicken-ham-sausage variant minus the shrimp (not a fan of crustaceans). It has plenty of kick without being too spicy and is very savory. I also love the barbecue beef po' boy. This is a great portion but not so filling that it will knock you out after lunch. The red beans and rice and dirty rice are also the best you'll find around. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that they don't take credit cards. I always have to plan a stop here in advance."""
"""Best docs ever!  Doc K is a leading expert in Pain Management and is fantastic!  Doc Jarrett makes my back feel like a million bucks!!  Doc K's schedule gets full pretty quick so make sure you get on the books for an appointment.  Unfortunately his day doesn't have much \""""wiggle room\""""."""
"I go to Strawberry Fields once a week for particular items because they are absolutely the best in town. They have absolutely the best bread in U-C. Especially their baguettes are just the freshest and tastiest I have been able to find in this town. I also love their selection of coffee beans and chips. But I agree with other reviewers that you can find some of the products this store sells elsewhere for a better price, so I wouldn't do all of my groceries there."
"One of the best 24 Hours I've been to. Working equipment, friendly staff, and good parking. I really want to try one of the classes they have badly."
One the few places that have noodles on campus. Reasonable price and a good variety of Vietnamese noodles and other Asian noodles. Lunch specials are also not bad. Service is good. A good place for an originate meal.
"As a visitor to Madison, I wanted to get some sports on, so headed down State St. and found this gem of a spot. It's obvious that on Labor Day Monday the only people here were college kids, but I loved everything about the bar/restaurant - decorations, TVs everywhere, Green Bay Packer schedule and the massive condiments cart with what I would call mustard heaven! \n\nI had some sconnie beers (Ale Asylum Hopalicious and Capital Island Wheat) and a yummy white brat. In Germany the white brats (weisswursts) are everywhere, and I totally miss them in North America, so it was nice to have a taste of home, in Madison of all places. The cheese curds are not cheap, but tasted kind of rubbery. Not too bad for my first experience, but nothing to call home about.\n\nCome here if you don't mind a sticky floor, cheap food, and a totally amazing sports vibe. I bet on a game night this place is impossible to get in!"
"Definitely a dive bar, but still one of my favorite places! Drinks are cheap and karaoke with Danny G is awesome. My only gripe is the one toilet for the girls--you gotta plan your pee breaks in advance!"
"I came here on a Sunday and I so wish I had found this place earlier.  I have been looking for a place that had other forms of entertainment than just people watching and I finally found Tyber Creek.  I loved the dark pub feel and how they had not only an upstairs but also outside seating.  Half of the beers on tap I had never even heard of so I decided to taste test them (and they let me!) and all but one were great!  I can't speak for what it's like on a Saturday night, but for a relaxed Sunday funday, I couldn't think of a better place to go.  Cornhole, shuffleboard, outside seating, friendly staff and patrons, and cheap yet unique beer.  Yay!  Plus the nachos weren't too bad either."
You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies  exhibit.  A MUST SEE IMMEDIATELY.  It's a feeling of infinity compounded by Star Wars with a dash of disco and a smattering of LED fireflies all around.  I want to live inside it all day long.
"They deliver, what more can you want? \nThey're solid classic Chinese food. I've tried the Tso's, Mongolian beef, beef lo mein, and egg drop soup. All exactly what I expected, exactly what I wanted.\nBe forewarned I tried a 4/5 pepper spiciness dish from the traditional menu (chengdu I believe). It was 60% hot peppers, 40% chicken, and nothing else. Blew my socks off and I can handle spicy."
"I lived in Madison for 5 years and we still have our house , now rented. Butler Plumbing are the best and the most honest in Madison. And it's a rare treat. Probably the best and most honest plumbers I met since I live in the US, and to be frank, that should include also France where I come from. Rare are those birds. And for review saying the contrary, I have numerous proofs of multiple estimates where they came lower for the same service or equipment, beyond their punctual and clean service. We still use them for our rental property. Great people. If only we could use their services in Chicago!"
"Hands down the best plain slice you can have in Oakland. The cheese has a nice sharpness and deep flavor. The sauce is perfectly tangy without being sweet, and surprisingly tastes like real tomatoes. The crust is crisp and has a bit of a salty bite to it. These three factors contribute to a thoroughly enjoyable pizza-eating experience.\n\nNon-plain slices vary. The Spinach, Tomato, and Ricotta white slices are absolutely wonderful. Their spinach actually has flavor, the tomatoes are fresh, and the creamy ricotta compliments the tangy crust and salty cheese excellently. Their topped slices and pies actually have plenty of toppings, unlike some other pizza joints in Oakland (cough Pizza Sola cough). Mushrooms taste canned, which is not very pleasant.. Pepperoni is average, I prefer Sola's. \n\nOther menu items again vary. Hoagies are average, there are better places in Oakland for that.  Calzones are based on the same great crust so they're pretty solid.\n\nGood, quick, and friendly service for the most part. My major qualm is that it closes pretty early and that it isn't open on weekends.\n\nOverall, easily the best spot in Oakland to grab a plain or spinach slice. Forget the competition, Milano's is king."
"I have never dealt with a company this efficient, meticulous and thorough. No complaints at all - I will continue leasing with them as long as I continue to live in Madison"
"I've tried LA Fitness, Pure Fitness, and other gyms in the valley. So far i am really liking the 24 Hour Fitness facilities and staff.  Pure and LA always seem like meat markets to me, and smaller gyms will just rip you off. This gym never seems too busy and they have decent cardio and weight equipment."
"A friend introduced me to Shomars over ten years ago and I've been sold ever since. Nine out of ten times I get the flounder and have never had a bad meal there, nothing but fresh and flaky, not greasy or heavy as in some of the restaurants that are solely fish places, no pun intended.  Great service, and great iced tea, a southern MUST."
"If you take beer seriously, Brawley's is really the only place you'd want to be seen buying brew.  \n\nBeers from around the globe all smashed into a tiny little building.  The owner is more than willing to help you find a beer to fit your taste.  \n\nOne thing that really pleases me about this place is their supply of Bell's.  Most beer stores south of the Mason-Dixon think that Oberon is the only beer than Bell's has to offer the world.  And oh, how wrong they are.\n\nBeer drinkers of all types can discover something new at Brawley's.  Do Charlotte a favor and support this small business."
"UPDATE June 2014\nI am obsessed with the pho from here. I order the spring rolls and number 26 Pho. Love, love, love it!\n\nDecided to try some where new since every single place seems to disappoint me over time.  Decided to finally try here since it is in the top 10 with Yelp.  Nice, clean restaurant, a little small but they make it work, and it has working AC! Something Pho So 1 was lacking.  I ordered the Large #26 which has tendon, tripe, brisket? I can't remember perfectly but it is my go to set of meats in my pho.  The pho was good. Tasty and not too salty.  My only complaint is that the pho needs more noodles, a little more meat and more jalepenos to put in it.  I did read someone's else review that said she usually orders 2 larges and I should of.  I felt like I was not full but hungry.  I could have eaten another bowl definitely.  The spring rolls were great also.  I would definitely good again and get more food."
I love this place I have been here a 1000 times and always the same service. I live about 5 miles away. Here where I lived are several Chinese places but non of them cook as these guys. I love this restaurant. I have been a loyal costumer for 10 years and probably be there for 10 more.
"We have purchased quite a bit of musical equipment and instruments from this location, and they always do a good job. Sometimes I feel a bit out of my league when employees start talking shop, but even still, they manage to help me get what I need.\n\nRecently purchased $99 in-ear headphones and it was a no-fuss deal. They have a decent selection of keyboards, low end to high end, and didn't sneer when I bought a less expensive model. \n\nGuys in the guitar department are great, and helped the Mr with a new bass guitar purchase. I prefer Sam Ash to the large competitor, and recommend it to friends looking to make a music-related purchase.\n\nOh, they also offer a music teacher discount, which I've used and has come in super handy, especially with expensive instruments."
"Very nice place... stayed two nights for my wife's work function... Beautiful grounds, nice Native American Indian motive throughout...\n\nAs a previous review noted, the grounds are spread out over a wide area...  but we were not dismayed as it allowed us an opportunity to walk off some of the GREAT food this place serves...\n\nWould have given 5 stars if their 5 star restaurant was open... but as we were there Sunday and Monday nights, which are the same nights that Kai is closed, I was EXTREMELY disappointed I did not get to try their menu, along with the extensive wine list!\n\nMy wife enjoyed her Aji spa treatment provided by her company (facial) and said it's the best she's had, and she's had her fair share over the years...\n\nDidn't need them, but I would have been bummed had I needed either WiFi or the Gym, as they charge for both..."

"After my review of Best Buy in Matthews I have to give Office Depot at least a 4 star review! My husband and I have HAD IT with the customer service at Best Buy. We decided to take a chance and go to Office Depot and see what they offered in terms of laptop selections and service. \n\nWhen we first walked in we went over to the laptop department and we were greeted by George. George was extremely helpful in explaining to us everything we should consider when making a large purchase. George spent over an hour talking with us about the different types of processors, ram and overall quality we would be purchasing. He wasn't pushy and was completely upfront about where he gets his commission.. George not only spent an hour talking with us late Friday night, but he also made sure to set up our laptop for us to pick up the next day. \n\nIn conclusion.... So if you're looking for a new laptop go see George at Office Depot! You might spend a few extra $ at Office Depot but you're going to get better service then you would at Best Buy."
I grew up eating  this pizza. It's very good. I think it's better when you order it by the cut instead of a whole pie. Its crispier & the toppings are on top instead of under the cheese  it's definitely pretty expensive and not pizza for eating every day. But it's quite good& enjoyable
"Sweet corn chowder pretty good,( I would have liked it better with WHITE MEAT not dark meat, that's just me)\nOrdered Kung Pao Shrimp, but they brought us CHICKEN? We took it, & it was still yummy. And the best part was the Chilean Sea Bass steamed with bean sauce but hmmmm it had bones? Never ever had my Real Chilean sea bass WITH BONES? But the flavor was buttery & creamy and we could NOT stop eating it EVEN after we were full!!!\nWE WILL 4 SURE BE BACK!!!\nMost Asian clientele...."
"Very pleased with everyone there. Most importantly, they got me in to two rental cars for a friends bachelor party at what ended up costing a fraction of what it would have been if getting a car at the airport.  Much better deal.  Very friendly service and good recommendations on things to do.  Very pleased with their help."
"I can't get enough of this place for a quick lunch.  Plus, you can find many healthy options that taste great!  One of those rare places that I can leave satisfied and still feel good about myself for eating somewhat healthy.  Don't worry though, you can find your fair share of unhealthy things too!!"
"""Also known as \""""Park Road Car Wash\"""".  Just as good or better than auto bell and cheaper.  Make sure to turn left after exiting the wash and have your car hand dried.  If you bought super or interior cleaning this is also where you go.  There's a little mailbox type container on the post if you want to leave a tip.  Very friendly and diligent."""
"I must profess my love for Showmars. There aren't many businesses that deserve 5 stars, but Showmars is on point. Everything is good. Customer service, all of the food and without a doubt, the undisputed star of the show - the Fish Sandwich. \n\nI've ordered it over 2 dozen times and each bite is as still as good as the first. The English language and Roman Alphabet alone cannot describe the satisfaction and pure bliss that it brings me. I wish you all could hear me and see my facial expressions. \n\nThat fish sandwich my friends, with tartar and coleslaw really is the world's greatest."
"Update: i have really come around to the pizza. The trick is that you need to eat it hot right out of the oven right in the store. It turns out to be a great place to walk to with my son. We get a little pizza. Kill it together and walk home. Sentimental value is increasing. AND THEY ARE STARTING 6 PACKS OF PICK YOUR OWN. our new go to for beer. Hoepfully they will expand it. But good smaller breweries so far. So.... i added another star.\n\nOld thoughts: Taste like College pizza- not good, not horrible gross, just boring pizza.  I will say they do a lot of fun types of pizza, but we live close to too many really really exceptional good pizzas to waste too much money here.  \n\nTHE THREE STARS: for a very good Italian sub and over all low prices.  Its hard to have pizza as much as I would want it, but I would hit them up for subs ANYTIME. VERY GOOD.  Baked fresh."
"I really like this place - I think it is more for why I have gone there then the actual place. My mother and I would have breakfast here a few times a month on our way to go visit my brother who was in the slammer. \n\nThe look/feel etc is great. The service is okay. Alot of the wait staff I have had there reminded me of overly stoned friends that I have - really nice, but a few screws were missing somewhere.\n\nThe food if I remember (haven't been there is over a year) is pretty good. I've only had breakfast there though. They have a bread basket that is awesome - but you need to share it with someone... it's a big basket of bread! \n\nI hope to return the next time I'm in Phoenix."
"PAM - you are - sexy, sleek, sophisticated and still a work in progress - your collections are young and show in the smallness of them and in the lopsidedness of the collection itself...However, you are good time!

The collections are interesting, the docents are knowledgeable and have a way of engaging patrons so you feel asking any question under the sun...no matter how art ignorant it may sound. It was a great way to spend a few hours of the day and I walked away feeling enthused about art and yearning to go back. Enjoy!"
"I thought this was a cute little place.  True, the store felt a little cluttered, but they had so much stuff in there!  I had gone with my husband and brother, and all the workers were so nice.  We went to look at the snowboards, and one of the workers talked to me about my snowboarding boots and was very helpful even though I already had the boot.  \n\nHe answered every question we had and always pleasant.  He was able to help my husband find the right pair of snowboarding boots, and was also willing to help find prices of snowboarding rentals from the store, and giving me recommendations for my friends to go in a week before they have a trip so they can put their rentals on hold.\n\nThe store was also super nice to give us a student discount.  All we did was ask if there were any other good sales in the future, and they went ahead and gave us the discount.  \n\nI highly recommend this place because of the friendly staff and great selection."
This isn't my usual Capriotti's location but I was driving by and decided to stop.  I ordered my usual turkey sandwich with extra pickles.  The guys working here were very friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone.
"Firstly, the staff was able to get me in on super, short notice. The receptionist was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. On my initial call, the receptionist completed most of my questionnaire  over the phone, I've never had that happen before at any medical facility. I was greeted at at the office and seen in a timely manner. Both the attending assistant and the dentist were extremely friendly and did a great job keeping me comfortable and pain free, I was in and out of the office in an hour. Great job!"
"What can I say about these guys and their business. They are fair, fun,, always helpful, reasonable and we  have always taken our  cars to them. Patrick helped my daughter find her first car. They have never over charged or looked for a way to jack up prices. Did I mention how fast they are? Thanks for all the years of wonderful service to our vehicles. We miss you!"
"""SOOOO GOOD!\n\nIf you're in Phoenix and you want fried chicken, go here.  The chicken is perfectly fried, tasty, and juicy.  It's exactly how I like my fried chicken.  And the waffles are delicious.  \n\nI was sad when I had to stop eating my waffles to eat more chicken and then I was sad to stop eating my chicken to take a bite of my waffles.  That's how good the food is!  Yes yes, I could have eaten both simultaneously, but I wanted to taste the flavor of each because they can stand alone and knock your socks off.\n\nIf I were a guest on the show \""""Best thing I ever ate - fried chicken\"""" this would be the place I recommend."""
"Cheap cheap cheap!!! Less than $10/person for lunch. They have sushi and it's quite good so instead of KAYA or Sushimom which is like $20/person, this is much cheaper and still delicious. Chinese food is top. Tons of seafood and yummy deserts. Nothing bad to say. Satisfy numerous cravings at once!"
"I tell all my friends about The Source, particularly Dr. David Arneson.\n\nProfessional, approachable, affordable.\nEasy to get in with the doc.\nSaturday hours.\nNature first, Rx if necessary. \n\nDr. Arneson is highly regarded in his field. This I did not know when I was looking for a doctor to see on a Saturday morning. I just needed some antibiotics and it didn't occur to me to go to urgent care. \n\nDr. Arneson is the most caring doctor I have ever been to. And he is also no nonsense, which I love. \n\nThe Source is a training clinic, and the days when student interns are there, you don't get charged an office visit fee. \n\nI have been a patient of Dr. Arneson's for 2 1/2 yrs."
The panang curry tofu is magical.
"This restaurant looks like it's been there forever, in a neighborhood that's not too pretty. But the food is great, the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are low. I had my usual favorites for trying out Vietnamese restaurants: pho wth rare beef and brisket, and banh xeo. Both came in generous portions. The pho was aromatic and very tasty, and the banh xeo was crispy and bursting with beansprouts, pork, and shrimp. Definitely a place for return visits."
"My family and I have been going to Shish Cafe for years. The food is always delicious; I don't believe I've ever had anything I disliked there.\n\nThat said - admittedly, service can be a little spotty at times. However, they will take carry-out orders if you call in, and will quote you fairly accurate times as to when they'll be ready. If I go to eat there, I just figure it'll take a while and order some Turkish coffee."
"""I liked the Sunday buffet (opens at 11:30 am).  It's tucked away in a corner and doesn't look big at first, but once you start examining what's there it's quite a lot.  If you're not sure how to eat the food, just get in line after an Indian and see how he or she puts it together.  You'll need those stainless steel sauce cups for the dipping sauces.  A dosa comes with the buffet. The food is good here, but it's not \""""Oh My God!!\"""" good, you know?  However, the desserts were spot on.  The gulab jamun was the best I've ever had--there was a good balance of the savory cheese and cardamon with the sweet syrup."""
"Cool place, good music and great sandwiches at reasonable prices.  Was a regular at the one in Boone and while this one seems a little, um, fake I guess it's still okay.  The Ricochet Rabbit is one of my favorite sandwiches."
"The BBQ pork fried rice was too Americanized.  But the other items were delicious.  Good dinner deal, comes with soup and rice."
"This place is just the type of place that brings back the memories of me and my grandpa going to grab breakfast in the small town I was born.  Cash only items and don't expect a lot of flair here.  In that same way this simple approach is totally refreshing and the food isn't nothing short of great.\n\nI got over easy eggs, bacon and ham and it might as well had been cooked right out of my own kitchen.  Service was great and polite and the entire environment was just as cozy as you could get.\n\nCan't wait to go back. \n\nPS.  Parking around the side is probably best."
"This place should have a higher score. 4 stars minimum IMO. I don't usually like NY style pizza and thought this was fantastic. BBQ chicken was incredible. Sausage Pepperoni very good as well. Caprese least favorite thing we tried, but still very solid.\n\nHonestly, i was skeptical given the overall condition of the restaurant, but the pizza is truly legit. Noticed they were tossing fresh dough in the back. Tough to find good pizza in Madison, but this is one of the best options."
"I absolutely love this place.  The staff is friendly and the food is DELICIOUS!!!  The buffets are great and so is any food you order off the menu.  I have never had a bad meal here before.  Every time we are in Madison, we stop by and have lunch or dinner or take an order out.  We are seriously going to miss Maharaja's now that we've moved to South Florida.  No Indian food lives up to this place."
"I like the Zoo so much, I regularly consider a membership. That's BIG for me.  Of course, I've never actually purchased a membership, so yeah...\n\nAnyway, what's not to love?  Nice layout, great animal selection (sounds like a steak house); all at a pretty fair admission price.  The food selections aren't bad either, though if you're going to a to focus on the food - well, you just shouldn't.  \n\nWish list: Though in general the zoo is clean, the restrooms and glass in many of the indoor viewing areas (gorillas, sharks, etc.) are usually pretty gross. Not gross enough to keep me away, but just sayin'.  \n\nThe zoo - and this one in particular - also makes for a great date or fun day with friends.  Remember, it's not just for the kiddies!  So, pack up your flask and go!"
"Wow, I'm surprised to see the negatives. We have had a good experience here.  Right now I am eating a veggie with so much lettuce I have a little salad on the side. cheeses and avocado are standard\n\nWe use all their services; delivery, internet pick-up and stop-in.  Fast delivery, GREAT pick-up, good stop-in. We always order online. The website is easy to use and gives all the options at the store with easy to select choices.  We do always go at night \n\nI also like the macaroni salad and I love the pickles. I wish I knew what kind of pickles or a similar pickle. I love them."
"I've been coming to this place since early childhood, and I love it. The only problem is the crowds! You either have to get there really early, like 7:00am, or later, around noon. Either that or come on a weekday morning. I'm addicted to their strawberry syrup, and their hash browns are divine. Come here for a good breakfast!"
"Definitely the best pho I've had in Vegas. I used to be a loyal Pho Kim Long fan, but Saigon 8 won me over. Their meat is much more tender, and it doesn't come out overcooked and rubbery. It does tend to get a little crowded sometimes, and I definitely like the seating at Kim Long better, but for the overall value and quality Saigon 8 is the place to go for Pho."
"""Great fresh food, good service and ownership that cares deeply.  \n\nI eat lunch here about twice a week.  Not only is the food good, but you cannot beat the prices.   It's the cheapest GOOD food in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut it's not all about the price.  The food is simple but authentic and delicious.   When my wife have dinner there -- about twice a month -- we usually order another three or four things to take home for the next day.\n\nThe service?  You ALWAYS feel welcome.  The wait staff are rushed at times, but friendly.  And \""""slow\"""" is a relative term.  This ain't a fast food restaurant.  Relax, enjoy an appetizer and talk with your meal partner.  \n\nAnd bring a bottle of wine."""
I always get the peking duck and deep fried sea bass those two dishes are very good..everything else is what you expect just a little pricey..
"Shuffleboard is the best bar game known to man.   Better than pool.  Better than darts.  Better than Galaga.  Play it, people!\n\nThe Dollar has all the great dive qualities you look for in a bar (juke, games, not crowded) and few of the downsides (dirty, rude staff)."
"I like the food, I do think ther"
"I went here with a family group after my brother's graduation. It should be mentioned that everyone ordered vegetarian items, and no one was disappointed, even my fussy grandparents.\n\nThe waiter was a jokester, and I found his excessively corny humor endearing.\n\nMy dish (family bean curd) was tasty, and I was pleased to learn that, for once, a restaurant had indulged me when I asked to turn the spice all the way up. My friend got the Vegetable Lo Mein. There were fewer vegetables than she typically prefers, but we both thought the sauce was superb. I also tried several other dishes and was not disappointed. It was definitely a nice experience.\n\nThe one negative I can think of was that the floor in the area we were seated was uneven. It's a minor gripe, and may have stood out more to me due to the cramped seating (as the whole fam was crowded around the table)"
Cheap drinks and great servers.
"One of the better Indian Restaurants in Pittsburgh (among a lot of bad ones). Very solid fresh food, with an outstanding selection of beer on tap (20 choices, including the only cider on tap I have seen outside of Vermont and NYC). The Chicken Makhani (Butter Chicken) and Lamb Seekh Kabob both stand out as excellent, as do the Samosas and Onion Naan. The quality of the chicken can be hit or miss, and they are terrible about keeping the water glasses full (maybe because they are metal and can't see when they are empty). The Sunday Buffet is a great value, and they offer a late-night half-off which attracts a large student crowd. Just be aware that the flat screen TVs that show Indian music videos, can be turns up very loud, but they are usually happy to turn down the volume if you ask."
omment: \nThe counter staff was excellent. I don't remember much about the rental - it's been over two months - but I do remember them being friendly and the SUV being very clean.
"Yelp 100 Challenge 14' * 17/100\n\nElaborate selection of milk tea flavors that alternatively come as smoothies as well. Topping additions will cost you a couple quarters. \n\nReason my friend took me here because of the fruity pop balls (gelatin-coated, boba looking balls filled with fruit flavored syrup thingy) that came in mango and lychee. Paired my taro milk tea with taro pudding which tasted real good. \n\nDefinitely a great go-to on a hot Vegas day. Staff were speedy and very friendly, place was clean."
"Best dentist office i have ever been to. 40 second wisdom tooth removal, while i thought he was playing around... I could tell more but than you'll think i'm a family member:))"
"My ace in the hole nail salon and they have remained consistent after years of service and whenever I stray away to test other nail salons, I end up coming right back here every time....so for nails, eyebrow wax and pedicures this is your spot...........they're all about pleasing their clients!"
"""I have to admit to being a regular at this Sammy's.  All of the restaurants have the same menu, but over the past three years of eating at four Sammy's in Vegas, this one has become my favorite for lunch, while the Rainbow location remains my happy hour spot.  Why the difference?  It all comes down to the staff.  The lunch crew at Sahara is dialed in to their customers and handles the rush in stride.  Mojca, Albert, Sam, and Tia all do a  terrific job, even at the busiest times.  The guys in the kitchen turn out consistently fresh and impressive entrees; particularly the salads.  Christina runs a tight shop and it shows up in the great food and service.\n\nHappy hour let's you graze through  a wide variety of half- price tapas that reinforce Sammy's Lebanese heritage.  I've had many a dinner of just these tasty items at Aaron's Rainbow location and if there's a \""""Cheers\"""" equivalent in my world, this is it.\n\nExcellent food, a wide variety and friendly, caring employees.  Hard to hit this trifecta in Vegas."""
"Fried chicken, waffles, and mac and cheese for breakfast, oh. hell. yes. Lo Lo's food is more than worth the wait, however I did feel kind of rushed when we were finally seated! I understand they wanna turn tables, but I just waited 45 minutes for a table, gimme a minute to decide what I want to eat! Despite the inevitable wait and the hurried service, I will most certainly be eating here again soon. Oh yes. I will."
"I have been a patient of Healthy OUtloof for years.  I am always treated with respect, and when I am talking with the doctors, they make me feel like I am their only patient.  They take all the time you need, offer suggestions, and really care.  I recommended them to friends and family and they all go there too and are very happy."
"""The Matthews Dilworth Coffee often is my \""""office\"""" when I'm running around town looking for a Wireless friendly spot to do freelance work. It's not too crowded, and the staff leaves you alone when you're parking there for a couple of hours...which is all I ask in a coffee shop to earn my love. While I land most often at the Matthews spot, I've also been to the East Blvd. location. Both offer a good selection of coffees and teas.\n\nThey don't have tons of food, but they do have a good enough selection to make a lunch there. I like their Bougie version of the Pimento Cheese sandwich, and their pastries are impressively cream-cheesey."""
mmm mmm mmm....i will be back...
"i've only been here once for lunch, but i can't think of a single thing to complain about. the greek-style home-cooked food was delicious and there were so many choices. i didn't buy anything to go in the store, but the selection was very large and pretty interesting. also, the prices were quite reasonable and salim was super friendly and helpful."
"""I don't know if I just never noticed them before or what, but in the past year or so I have been getting the cookies and cream (or \""""oreo\"""") donut and seriously, it is amazing. Nothing else to really report on, just the possible addition of this magical hunk of tastiness. Get one!"""
I have been using Kevin's for many years to repair our computers.  He has always given me honest advice and saved me money when possible.  He has never let me down.  I highly recommend him.
"Not bad, I would go back."
"Have been here more than 5 times and really like sitting at the bar with Michelle the bartender, she's great.  Monday nights are 50% off wine night and it's a great time to go.  They do run Restaurant.com and Groupon specials all the time so there are a lot of coupons out there and they seem to work because the place is fairly busy. I don't like their pizza but think their tomato app, chopped salad and salmon app are all good. The entrees are expensive but do come with sides and we haven't tried dessert yet.  I still prefer this place for happy hour (1/2 off apps and wine) but it's not my favorite place for dinner."
I like Redbeards.  The patio is nice and provides a fun ambiance for Shiloh Street...\n\nHappy Hour specials are good.  I've had their mozzarella sticks which are massive but good.  I haven't gone here on a weekend night.  Bartenders are nice and so are the waitresses.\n\nOnly downfall:  they need a website.
"Very informal, Jamerica offers Jamican comfort food at affordable prices. Located in a funky storefront, the restaurant has self service drinks (a reasonable beer selection with a very, very minimal selection of generic varietal wines). The waitress counts bottles to figure your drink tab. The jerk selections (salmon or chicken) are good and only spicy by Midwest standards, and are served on an enormous plate of rice, red beans, and greens. Recommended for the hungry."
"I had the French toast and it was delicious, possibly the best I've ever had. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his scrambled eggs special. Took off a star simply because the coffee wasnt very good but this is a lovely place with great food. Would def recommend!"
"Came in today to get my brows done at the Benefit Brow Bar. April did a great job and was very friendly. I had a coupon for $5 off $10 and the Ardell lashes were on sale so I decided to get a few packs. Since I am still new to false lashes, I asked one of the young ladies about them and she was very helpful and knowledgeable about the products. She even recommended a lash for everyday wear. I love this store but they always seem to be out of stock of many NYX products which is a bummer because that is my favorite brand. I also don't always get asked for my rewards card which can be irritating because I am usually a level 4 - 5 at least twice a year so when my rewards don't get added in, I miss out."
"I was searching Madison for a delicious bacon egg and cheese, and I found it. Their breakfast sandwich was probably the best I've ever never made. Each ingredient was a little unique in its own way (though I dont quite remember its exact makeup at this moment).\nThe staff is extremely friendly, and nice. A glass jar containing tea leaves broke behind the counter, and they still had smiles, no signs of negativity towards one another in the public eye  -which make the customer smile.\n\nIf I had one complaint, they serve cold brewed iced coffee without any sweetener. Adding sugar to the cold coffee just doesn't sweeten it up as it should, leaving lots of sugar at the bottom. I still enjoyed the coffee though, very rich flavor.\n\nI'm glad they gave me a paper menu to take back home so I can oogle at what I may get next time I'm in Madison."
Willabys makes me happy. Besides the diner from Pulp Fiction it creates my mental image of a diner. I was home for the holidays and went there as a destination.  The menu hasn't changed. The servers are great. The food takes a little time. Because it's cooked for you.
"I have been using Monetti's for the last four years or so on wide range of projects - both lowering and raising hems, replacing zippers on dresses, changing a wide leg pant to a more polished narrow leg, etc.  They were also absolutely fantastic on altering a sale jacket that I just had to have that was too wide in the hips and waist and too short in the arms.  Always a wonderful job and always wonderful service."
"Being a Clevelander and living in Las Vegas, I often get homesick for my city on the lake, but when I walk through the doors of the Keg, it's like being home again. Lots of Cleveland sports gear on the walls and the game's always on. This place fills up fast on game day, so get there early if you want a seat at the bar. Food takes a little longer when the Browns are playing, but the kitchen and lovely ladies serving up your dish work really hard to make your experience a good one. And let's not forget about the bartenders! The best combination of sassy and friendly. Sometimes I feel like I'm on an episode of Cheers. The cheese steak sandwich is delicious! You can't go wrong with a burger, either. Overall, one of the greatest bars in the valley when it comes to food and atmosphere. A must-visit for any Cleveland sports fan!"
"I've been to Vegas more times then I can count, and I've always stayed right on the Strip. This time was a little different though. Because of a delay, my airline (Us Airways) gave me a hotel voucher for the night. Ok, sure.\n\nTo sum up my experience: I will be staying here the next time I am in Vegas! BFF and I were so happy with the Hampton Inn! They offer a free shuttle, which runs to the airport and also to the Strip. The location is great; although it's not right on the Strip, it is walking distance. It is caddy-corner from In-n-Out, for those familiar. \n\nThe lobby and room were nicely decorated. I will be posting pictures of the room and bathroom. We were very impressed by the quality of the mattress and bedding. I was also impressed with the friendliness of the staff. Every single staff member, from the front desk to housekeepers, said hello with a smile to us. The Hampton Inn also offers a complimentary hot breakfast every morning."
"Our go-to place for good, non-overpriced vietnamese food in vegas! I don't know why people go to pho saigon, because there's no line here and I think the food is better! It's just a little farther drive down spring mountain rd. \n\nI've had the pho, vermicelli, and the rice dishes here and everything is good! You can't fail with whatever you order, so don't worry! I always end up caving into ordering the fillet mignon (bo luc lac) with french rice because I just can't say no to garlic! They make it better than the restaurants in little saigon in california! If you're a garlic lover like myself, you'll love this dish because the beef is drenched in so much garlic, you'll have enough to eat it with the rice too!"
This is a fair-sized store. It is clean and well-stocked. I found a pair of great chairs in good condition for way less then I would have paid elsewhere. And supporting Goodwill is a nice bonus. I'd reccommend stopping here before trying a more upsale resale store.
I work for a company that has a small fleet of vehicles and I have been getting oil changes done at this location for almost 10 years. I can honestly say that I have had a positive experience every time I come in.  Which is the reason why I take my personal car their as was well.\n\nIf you come in around mid afternoon more than likely there is no wait and the ENTIRE staff works on your vehicle to get you on the road as quickly as possible.\n\nThis is the place to go for an oil change in the Charlotte Area
"""I went in today to buy my little man some \""""new\"""" clothes that were more weather appropriate and was impressed by the amount of inventory they had. I follow them on Facebook and they seem to have sales going on regularly. Today they had 75% off green tagged items. I ended up walking out with 17 pieces of clothing for $35. A lot of them were gently used and new looking and were brands like Gap, Gymboree, Osh Kosh,  Carter's. \nOnly recommendation I have is that they declutter a little bit. It's hard to maneuver around. I think of they got the straight clothes rack and made aisles it would be a lot better."""
"Price's is the best fried chicken I have had down here in Charlotte thus far! I love how quick the service is. Not very convenient that its cash only but there is an ATM inside. I find it humorous that you get a package of ketchup attached to your fork by way of a rubber band. This is no four start establishment, far from it, but the chicken and the price is worth returning."
"I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got over to the Roasting Company one day for lunch.  I had heard about it for years and my mom was always getting it for me when I was sick but I had never actually been inside.  She said the way they seasoned their chicken was perfect for getting over the common cold.  Well she was right, it always did the trick.  So I was thrilled when on a rather healthy-feeling day I went in for a delicious meal of fresh veggies and homemade cake!  The chicken, as always, hit the spot.  There was a cool, funky vibe in there thanks to the young and welcoming staff.  And it was nice to just order at the counter and then kick back in the casual environment and catch up with old friends."
"We used to come here to read, study and write. I am a supporter of a local business so I will try to choose this kind of place as opposed to other chains. \nThey have a very refreshing ice-tea with a reasonable price and their mocha meets my standard. \nI love the atmosphere too- not too quiet but not noisy. The barista is always nice on every visit I make."
"I feel like this gas last me a bit longer than any other types of gas stations. Texaco has always been a favorite. I'm constantly going in with my chefs cost and the cashiers always recognize me, very helpful and friendly."
"Food is terrific. Service is laid back but responsive. Definitely recommended. Would be 5 stars, but it's a bit spendy."
"I love this shop! They really do a great job on my nails. My nails never chip or break. I never go anywhere else now. Lonnie and Jonathan are the best, and they run a nice, clean shop."
Dr. Tymczyna is probably the best doctor I've ever been to.  She really takes the time to LISTEN and empathize at every appointment.  Everyone else in the office is friendly and knowledgeable as well.  Highly recommended.
Best wings in Pittsburgh!!! This place has a HUGE variety of sauces . Everything taste great and the people that work there are friendly.  The only negative thing about the place is the smell sticks with you as its a small joint.
"""I signed up for the E-club and they sent me a FREE Entree for my Birthday!! I love FREE Stuff! \n\nLast time I went here I tried the burgers-NOT real impressive, so this time I asked the waitress to suggest the best thing. RIBS!\""""that's what she said\""""\n\nSo I got the full rack of St Louis Style Ribs with sweet corn casserole & loaded baked potato.\n\nThe restaurant was fairly slow with 4-5 customers so the food came out fast and the service was adequate.\n\nThey have a large LCD Tv on the wall so I was able to enjoy the MNF game and the food was really good.\n\nNot REAL bbq but the meat was tender, the sauces were all good. The baked potato was great & so was the casserole(just not enough of it).\n\nBe sure to take advantage of this offer and CLICK on any Image!"""
Every time I go to china town I have to go here.Me and my nanny love this place.Im not real big on the boba but i do love there smoothys.I usualy get the grape kind and its always very good.Im scared to try the tea because im not a real big tea person.If anyone is the same way but likes them let me know how you feel about them.\nGrape smoothy-Sweet dosnt taste like normal grape flavored stuff but its still wonderful
"Are you kidding me? If you want authentic Mexican food- GO HERE! They have the best tacos and burritos. This place is so packed all the time, expect to wait. It is a fast food restaurant with plenty of seating. This is a hidden gem for Las Vegas. Recently discovered it and crave it all the time."
Fabulous job!  I've never had my house cleaned by someone else before and was extremely pleased.  They arrived in the expected window and worked from the moment they entered the house.  Everything was left spotless!
"I have always passed my this place and had never stopped in until and ex was wanted to try them and boy was i glad we did. As you walk in you are taken away from the hustle and bustle of being on South Blvd, and is kinda taken to a different place. The decor is very nice and upscale. I must admit they were a little pricey but in my opinion they were will worth it, The portions are huge and they are enough to feed two people. The staff is amazing and are willing to go the extra mile to make sure your happy and that everything is going great. The night we went the owner was there and offered free drinks and I'm down for a free drink anytime.. lol but over all i would rate this a 4 out of 5"
"Better than KFC and even Bojangles!  Friendly staff, fast service, cheap greasy goodness all around.  Bring cash."
"A great alternative to going to Pamela's in the strip if you don't want to wait for a table. This P&G has a lot of the same menu items like the crepe style hot cakes and lyonnaise potatoes, as well as a variety of omelets. It's also an old school pharmacy, which adds some charm. The service is good and the prices are reasonable."
I only go about once a year when visiting a friend but if I didn't live 887 miles away I would be there a few times a week. The sandwich selection is great- even for vegetarians! The fact that you can grab a single beer out of the cooler yourself to go with your sandwich amazes me.
I have been using concrete accessories for many years as a decorative concrete contractor. Their products are the only products that you will find being used on any artistic concrete work done on the strip. Their staff is beyond knowledgable and they will go beyond to walk you through any questions you might have. \nI recommend seeing David or Jose if you stop in and let them know Brad sent you!
"Oh hell yes:\nFried dill pickles? check.\nCheap beer? check.\nWhile its always packed, and I mean always, we'll stand around for as long as it takes to get a seat. Jukebox is classic, food is cheap and fried (great ranch here) AND veggie friendly (jumbo soy dog, yes yes), wait staff is rad. Not like the Penguin needs anyone else blowing it up, but this is a place you can't miss. Super comfy + cheap = win."
"Advantage Tax is the best place in Vegas. I have been going to Charlie for at least 10 years. Charlie and his daughter Kathy are tax experts. They can help with anything. I have never had any problems with the IRS and Charlie will work with you on any problem you have. \n\nIf you want your taxes done right, this is the place to go. They will welcome you as family and you will never go anywhere else."
"Very happy about my meal here. Might not have been the best service in town (in fact the waitress forgot our pita) or the most. Original kind of food, but it sure is pretty tasty and pretty authentic too.\n\nI had the grape leaves dolmas and BF had the lamb shank. I loved my dolmas! They had just the right degree of sour and the perfect amount of yogurt vs. red sauce. Pretty great! Only criticism I have is that the leaves were a tad too thick. Didn't get to try the lamb shank but BF seemed to like it! \n\nRice was also good and I believe it might be more authentic than basmati which is and Indian rice...\n\nOh and lentil soup was delicious! Just the right amount of spicy!\n\nWill go back to try some of the kebabs and other dishes!"
"""I don't think I would describe this as authentic as much as what Americans expect for a  Mexican restaurant, but it is very 'Fiesta!!!\""""  in decor, with lots of tile, colors, booths and tables that can be put together for groups and large families.  Chips and sauces/slaw provided.  We've eaten here many times over the years.  Good value.  Portions are huge.  Table side guacamole is good.  Near the airport and a good place to  have a quick meal with friends who have a 2-3 hour layover."""
"Good thrift store.  Crowded!  small.  No dressing rooms.  But i went on a limb and grabbed two pairs of jeans for 15 bucks total.  One pair is awesome, the other is okay.  But I'll take it.  I grabbed some good books as well.  I will definitely go back but probably not on the weekend this time."
"Oh my god, get them when they come right out of the oven.  The one topped with coconut, so fluffy, but crispy on the outside!!!!  Coconut in the batter too?  I have no idea, wonderful!\n\nThe apple fritter was also very good, but a little too sweet for me this time around."
"Yep - I'm a fan. Any place that sends me a daily email with a new SALE for the day/week gets my vote. Is it a custom suit or Nordstroms quality? No. But it doesn't try to be either. Good quality and a great price...period. My favorites are the Signature suits; travelers non-iron shirt; cuff links and their sweaters. Great place to shop for the following...yourself; husband or Dad/Grandpa. It's a chain, some better than others. Sales people aren't that knowledgable, but better than Mens Warehouse IMO. They're located across the country and the odds that one is located withing 15 miles of wherever you are is high!"
"I love coming here. Amazing sushi. But best of all its fried rice is like no other. I'm not a big sushi fan I don't order anything but crab, shrimp and salmon but I must say its very good here."
"Jackpot - outlet center. I haven't seen so many travel size products in one store - shampoos, conditioners, lotions, soaps, etc. Endless possiblities for gifts for friends or for yourself. They sell cute travel bags so you can easily put together a kit. This store alone was a good fine. I always wait until products go on sale or friends & family to buy at the regular store. But I ended up buying a trio of hand lotion - $21 for 3 - 1oz tubes. I like the travel size lotions because I can bring it anywhere and the scents are lovely. I spent $21 for 3 and got a 0.5 oz for signing up on their mailing list. I would have definitely bought more but I could only fit so much into my luggage. Definitely heading back here the next time I come out to Vegas."
"Okay, this place is killer. This place has great beer, great wait staff, cool atmosphere, and kick back to hang out at. The corn beef and hash was great, and they know how to make a black and tan right! LOVE it! The place is jammed packed on St Paddy's Day, so that tells you something!"
"Hands down this foodies favorite place to eat.  I travel often for work and for as many of times I make attempts to try other Mediterranean restaurants I am always disappointed and return back to Pittsburgh and crave the flavors from here.  It's always a treat and love being able to support locally owned small businesses.\n\nMy favs are Mousaka (with ground meat, potatoes, onions, and zucchini) , Schwarma (shredded lamb, wrapped in Pita with tahini), grilled chicken, rice, green beans with tomato sauce ...those are just to name a few. .. The rice pudding and baklava to wrap things up.\n\nIf your ever in the Shadyside area or are able to make the trip a definite must!!! I travel 30-40 minutes at least once every couple weeks to get my fix!"
"Good Philly Cheesesteaks can be tough to find. Especially in Pittsburgh. I'm glad to have stumbled across Campus Deli - by far, they serve the best cheesesteak around.\n\nAdmittedly, in this city, that's not exactly saying much. But that's alright. I'll be stopping here again in the future.\n\nOn another note, the bacon cheese fries are excellent. Though they probably took a few years off my life, and my arteries are probably still upset with me, I can't deny that I loved them. Crisp, consistent, and no grease. It almost makes the trade-off worth it."
"Seriously, every woman in Madison should go here.  The staff is sweet and you can find pretty much anything you're looking for.  I always feel very safe when I go here, which is a big plus."
"Best sandwiches in CU.  Also the best humus dishes.  If you go make sure you try the following combo:\n\n1. Sour dough bread,\n2. Salami,\n3. Provolone,\n4. Lettuce,\n5. Mustard,\n6. Olives. (if you like olives.)\n\nI used to get that sandwich all the time before I moved.\n\nAlso be sure to try their pastries, which come from a bakery in Urbana.  They get their bread from that bakery too, so don't go on Sunday or Monday because the bakery is closed and Paradiso won't have fresh bread.  (This makes a huge difference, get humus if you go on the wrong day.)\n\nA couple of the reviews below complain of the smokyness.  It's no longer smoky as Urbana law prohibits smoking in bars and restaurants."
"Well, the Wings are different, thats for sure. They use a dry seasoning on top, which I wasn't so sure about at first, but ended up loving them. They have a few pool tables and the music is top40ish from rap top40 (-1) to alt top40. I don't go out of my way to go there except Wing Night and sometimes Fridays to meet some friends that are regulars."
Fresh custard!  This place rocks.  Don't get your hopes up expecting a glitzy drive-through but definitely stop and has a flavor of the day.  It's worth the trip.
"Sullivans has won me back. We went for Christmas Eve.  The only problem was the reservation wasn't in the system but they got us in.  We got the Seafood Tower.  I had looked forward to the tower all week. I wasn't disappointed.  Crab, lobster tails, Shrimp Cocktails, and oyster were all fresh and delicious.  We had an excellent bottle of Viognier .  We all ate bacon wrapped scallops.  Yes, we ate seafood at a steak resturant because the get in fresh seafood several times a week.  We had the best service that we have ever had at Sullivan's.  I wish I could remember his name but he was originally from Ecuador.  He was attentive and gracious but not in our face.  It was a fabulous celebration for Christmas Eve."
"I have four bikes, none expensive.  I learn something every time I go into Biketek, and don't really go anywhere else.  Frank is a great resource.  I've gone to most bike shops in town and this one is my favorite."
"""Located in a small and unassuming old strip mall on North Decatur is the kind of gem that can easily be overlooked, yet has stood the test of time (now in their second decade). Although the \""""tripa\"""" has really been a standout, so far we have not found a taco that would not be ordered again, with each being well thought out in preparation, and generous in the meat portions. A four taco \""""combination\"""" comes with a basket of chips while you are waiting, which can be used to try the different concoctions from their salsa bar. Have not gone beyond the tacos yet, because they simply are so damn good.\n\nYou can see in the presentation, and taste on the palate, just how much these folks care about their product."""
"Char's is a hidden Phoenix gem.  It is a very small bar that hosts some pretty awesome bands.  Of course my FAVORITE band is Soul Power.  Friday nights are packed.  The one wish I had is that they wouldn't over pack the place.  So what can expect from this neighborhood bar?  The good:  Great music, reasonable drinks that are not weak by any means, a very diverse crowd, the urge to dance the night away, only a $6.00 cover and reasonably priced drinks.  The bad:  Dance floor is very small, they do not serve food, if you don't like crowds or tight places this venue is not for you, the VIP section is a shabby one."
"A regular hangout during my graduate school years, Dee's was always a mixture of folk, from the college crowd to punk rockers, metal heads to the local pubbies. Often a place we were seen post dinner, pre-Bar 11 (which isn't in the Yelp listings, but worth finding if it's still there) and were many billiards were shot, shots taken and songs chosen from a jukebox. Beer = cheap, Southside = fun. Try it."
"As I-Hops go, it is pretty typical.  My wife loves getting breakfast there at all times of the day.  I've had both breakfasts and lunches ..mostly sandwiches.  nothing great, but it's passable.  The waitresses are usually good, cheerful, and attentive ( tho occasionally you get a clinker ..but that happens everywhere).  These are hard working ladies so leave them a reasonable tip."
"Nice staff, good food."
"To make things simple, foodies should not go to Vegas and neglect to visit this jewel! It's not on the strip, but it is worth the 10-15min commute. Omelets your way...and they are huge and flavorful. The home fried potatoes that compliment your omelette are good, though they pale in comparison to the omelette. Oh, and the banana or pumpkin bread that come with your meal is delicious, as in better than your grandma's (if your grandma could really cook). I got an omelet with shrimp, crab, avocado, and cream cheese with egg whites and it simply blew my taste buds away. Fresh, hot coffee and they keep your cup full!\n\nOld school feel by the ambiance of the place...very homey, rustic and charming. The service was amazing! Server was very attentive, full of recommendations, and worked to meet dietary restrictions of my group. \n\nHands down, 5 stars!! If in Vegas, don't miss out on this breakfast masterpiece!"
"Not exactly cheap with dishes around $10,  but my lunch of spicy pork belly, tofu, kimchee soup (Pork Belly Kimchi Jjigae mentioned in another review) was simply excellent. The three sides were tasty but between the soup and included rice on the side, I could have done without. \n\nAs others commented, service is nice and friendly if not exactly attentive (you may need to ask as opposed to being asked)."
Really good! We eat there frequently and it is consistently good. I'd give it a 5 but I tend to rate too high I think.
"Nice outdoor seating, good drink collection, very good hummus, and a very funny menu. I have only had the hummus and a tasty wheat beer (Southampton Double White) for lunch so my experience with the menu is limited, but what I had was solid good. The hummus is recommended; comes with a mix of warm pita bread and crispy pita bread. The crispy pita is on the heavier side, fried, but is very tasty. Others in my party had various items, including cheesy balls and salads, and seemed satisfied.    \n\nThe service deserves far less than four stars. It took forever for them to take our orders at the beginning and then forever again to get our checks at the end. Granted, we were a party of ten or more but the restaurant was not crowded. I am still giving it four stars, though, as this might be an off day for our server. \n\nThe outdoor porch on a summer day is excellent. Beautiful location to experience the Mount Washington neighborhood."
Food is amazing. Wonderful vegetarian selection. I came here solely because of the huge vegetarian selection. So many choices I couldnt decide. The service was less than attentive but I think this is sort of a typical thing to expect at a restaurant in this genre. The food more than made of for the flighty service and short wait. The herbal salad had such an intense burst of flavor in every bite that I often had to pause and chew a few extra times to enjoy the bite. Cant wait to go back and try a few more vege dishes.
When you need something quick like the basics its a great place and decently priced. I always thought of target as an upscale Walmart ....Yep I'm still a fan...Keep it simple with good quality and I'm good to go....Next
"""FABO!!  What a nice place and great meal to end a stay in this beautiful city!  The Avenue is nothing special from the outside...and wood paneling night-clubby inside...but the staff were fantastic with a great sense of humor which added tremendously to the experience the 8 of us had.  Breakfast was HUGE (several of us couldn't finish it) and delicious!  Prices were more than reasonable for the portions and the food.  Crab-cake benedict for me...partner had a goat cheese, potato, carmelized onion, and red pepper omelet.  One and only one regret (my fault...see previous review for Shamrock and throw in too much beer the night before) is that I wasn't \""""up to\"""" having one of their Bucky Bloodies along with breakfast.  Which means I have to go back!"""
This is the second time I have Had Tony Come to our house to do some repairs and add some new features. We were selling our house and there had to be some electrical work completed before the closing date. Tony showed up promptly as always and again treated me like a family member. What a very special person in this day and age to be on time and always in a very friendly mood. I would highly recommend Tony for any electrical work you may need done in your home or work.!!\nRollie L
"""What I would say is, if you're staying here, make sure to go down stairs to the second floor of the hotel and have breakfast. They open till 11am enough time to get yourself together and get your food on. The eggs was amazing. Two kinds. One with cheese and pepper the other not with cheese. Both scrambled and then the biscuit is to die for. Greedy me had to try everything, \""""eat all you can stuff into your system Buffett\"""". They have all kinds of Cereals and fruits and bakeries and all and all. Just make sure you have breakfast. Oh wait, is not free. It worth the price. Just eat till you think that you've consume your money worth. Don't go late for they won't let you in :)"""
"This place is exactly what it is...a smokey slot joint. No food but nice alcohol selection and great staff. I don't smoke or play, but I've been coming here for years as my go-to Friday night after work bar. I find it to be unpretentious and a nice place to unwind."
"This place is great! I hate going to the dentist but they make it very comfortable - the staff is terrific, organized and the establishment is very clean, (and tastefully decorated!)."
"Not bad for Las Vegas, Coming from the bay area, its going to be a tough review but holds its own for a mexican joint. The prices are amazing and the burrito holds its own."
"Hands down, the best milk I have ever tasted! If you live in Estrella Mountain Ranch, Verrado, Litchfield Park, Buckeye, Goodyear or Avondale - this family owned and run farm is just a few minutes away in Rainbow Valley! We just returned home with 2 gallons of vat-pasteurized goat milk that I'm sure won't last the week. If the only goat milk you've had is from the grocery store, you've never had good goat milk. Call Wendell (623-WENDELL) during the week, and you can make an appointment on Saturday morning to visit the dairy and purchase milk, goat cheese, or anything else they have made fresh that week. We've also had their ricotta and ice cream, which was absolutely delicious. On our first visit, Wendell gave us a mini-tour to show us how they care for the goats and their milk. It's a permanent part of our Saturday morning routine, now! They do recommend you bring an ice chest - we haven't yet but we live really close in EMR. Stop by and visit - you'll wonder what you waited for!"
Love Love Love this place! Food and service is always A1. My only complaint is the KoolAid is way OVERPRICED!!!!
"Mineo's has quickly become one of my favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh.  I usually only go here for slices, because ordering a full pie is too many calories to have around the house (and my wife is pretty much vegan so she doesn't go for the cheese...)\n\nWhat makes their pizza stand out from other pizza places is that is tastes homemade.  Their crust is fabulous and crispy and their sauce is fantastic.  Plus, they are open late and most people in Mineo's are quite nice!\n\nI am updating my listing to add the following:\n\nIf you go to Mineos, bring cash.  They don't accept credit cards!"
"I am extremely happy they have a place like this in Las Vegas. I was scared when I moved here I wasn't going to be able to satisfy my super nacho fix. Roberto's is the place to go for late night Mexican food. Plus, everything is decently priced. I will definitely be back.\n\nI recommend anyone to give this taco shop a try. If you don't know what to order, try any of the following:\n\n-Three Rolled Tacos\n-Carne Asada Burrito\n-Anything with Carnitas\n\nEnjoy!"
"This is a great place to come unwind in the outdoor seating, although most people have the same idea so the wait to get outside can be long sometimes. The drinks are good, although they make a killer mojito!\nThe food is pretty good, I agree with the other posters that it isn't anything special though. I recommend the Avo-Cat or conch fritters, both very delicious! But for such a small kitchen it does taste good! \nThe only downside is the cash only, because I normally don't walk around with a wallet full of $20's and constantly walking to the ATM gets old."
"I have been to quite a few nail salons throughout Charlotte, and Matrix Nail is by far my favorite. \n\nAlthough they do not offer the massaging chairs that most salons have, the environment is clean and tidy. A must, if you ask me. \n\nThe prices are average, for what I believe to be well above average service. The pedicures and manicures really stand out. The technicians spend extra time trimming and perfecting each nail. The jobs are not rushed at all! \n\nThey offer a wide selection of colors from OPI and Essie and always carry the super trendy colors I am too chicken to try. Please note I have never gotten any gels/wraps/acrylics so I don't know how they rate in this area. \n\nI highly recommend the threading as well. They do a PERFECT job and at a much lower price than other salons I have seen. \n\nDespite the lack of fancy chairs and that they only accept cash, I will remain a regular at Matrix for the QUALITY of services I consistently receive."
"What is not to like about this food???\n\nEverything is good.. the mashed potatoes, salads, chimichurri, bread, and best of all the MEAT... so juicy all the time... My mouth is watering just thinking about it... Well worth it, not too much of a wait.. not fancy at all. \n\nMUST TRY THE ENTRANA.... i"
Wow!  Super impressed!  Definitely ignore the sketchy outside - the inside is awesome!  The place was very nice & clean.  The massage chairs were the nicest & most high tech I have been in.  Service was very friendly and thorough.  I got gel nails & a pedi for $55.
"I'm giving this 5 just for the sheer consistency - I've been eating here since it opened and have never not once had a bad meal or service. That says a lot in this town, where the transient nature means great fluctuations in both. I love the ambience - exposed brick walls, NO machines, optional patio dining. Adding in some live music on Fri & Sat nights might be great. \nLove the chocolate fondue!!!"
"This is the diamond in the ruff, the locals secret spot for the best Donuts in Vegas. Try it once and you'll never go anywhere else."
"We have two doxies we take to Dr Stone. She is very kind and thorough. We never have had to wait to see her and the waiting room and exam rooms are always clean. We are often surprised at how reasonable the visits are, expecting it to be more.  We and our dogs are very happy with Craig Road Animal Hospital."
"I didn't think I'd like it, but I've eaten there several times and enjoyed everything I've gotten. The straw is good, the new yorker is great, and my favorite is the brisket on sourdough with swiss. The chili is also good, and I hear great things about the burgers. \n\nI agree with Jim W. - fast and quality\n\n(this is not a date place)"
"I just graduated after 4 years at CMU, and I can confidently say that Dave and Andy's ice cream is the only food I'll miss from Pittsburgh.  \n\nThey have many interesting flavors of the day, but cookies and cream is a solid staple that never disappoints.  Whatever flavor you choose, make sure you get it in a waffle cone, you'll smell it the moment you walk through the door."
"Love it! Very nice and always showing the newest, I mean newest movies so inpatient people like me who hate to sit n get nails feet and eyebrows done can enjoy!"
"Man, I can't believe it's been nearly three years since I'd been here.  But I had a taste for some Chinese food today so I walked up here for lunch.  Chinatown Inn is still a good ol' fashioned Chinese restaurant.  You know the kind--no Asian Fusion but good ol' egg rolls.  \n\nFor $7.95 you can get the lunch special including soup or egg roll.  I went with the egg drop soup.  I passed on the egg roll today (I know, the heresy!).  I like my food a little more basic so I went with my usual, fresh broccoli & chicken.  And that broccoli was fresh my friends.  It had a nice snap to it.  \n\nYeah, yeah folks.  You know it's Americanized Chinese food.  Sometimes that hits the spot though!"
"Its a brewery inside a freak'n church...it looks and feels really cool inside, pulling up your thinking, not they didn't, but, uh, yes they did. \n\nThe beer is not the greatest but still pretty good, it's worth checking out if your in the city."
"I had bought all my saltwater equipment and fish from them and they were great! I am very impressed with them any time I had any questions or concerns they were very quick to help! Need Fish or equipment this is the place to go, and Thomas the manager is FANTASTIC!!!"
"I love this vet!  I have 5 animals and they take very good care of us.  They are always flexible and very pleasant to deal with.  Dr. Tamara is who my babies see, and they love her, as do I.  I live less than 1 mile from a different practice, but I drive the 30 minutes into Charlotte to go to Commonwealth.    I won't take my furry family members anywhere else."
"Hands down the best bbq I've eaten in a restaurant.  God, I wish I was eating it right now!\n\nThey take debit/credit now!!!"
Better than a farmers market.   Like the farm comes to you. \n\nHits: free samples and helpful service.\n\nMisses: slow cashiers\n\nHints: don't forget to check the grocer for\ntasty dairy and deli selections. (The potato salad is better than homemade.)
"I've lived in Champaign for the majority of my life and when I got my Mitsubishi Spyder when I was 16, I took it here for almost every service check-up (except for when I went to college in Florida) and I was always pleased.\n\nJust recently, I bought a VW Touareg from an awesome salesperson there and I've been happy with it so far. I definitely plan to keep going there in the future.\n\nThat being said, if the false reviews by O'Brien dealers are true, that's VERY disheartening."
"This is the very definition of a dive bar, and I love it.  It's been forever since I've played pool and this was a fantastic place to take it up again.  The drinks are pretty cheap, so it you are the kind who likes to get a buzz on while playing, go for it.  Be prepared to smell like smoke for about a week though.  I know some people don't like that kind of thing, but hey I used to live in Iowa City so I'm used to it."
"Went back today and had a much better experience.  The food was nice and fresh and everything was good.  Walked in and was greeted pleasantly by the lady at the register,  Gave her my 7 bucks and ate too much.  The huge plus was they had General Tso's chicken.  Love it.  Walked out and she wished me a happy weekend.  I will go back once my Chinese Buffet timer resets.  I think the thing to remember is this place inst in the best area.  Its not dangerous or anything.  Would honestly be 5 stars on this visit but the place is a little rough.  You literally sink in the seats."
"I had my side ribs done by Willy. He recreated a drawing that i brought in which looks even better.  It was a cover up of a small tat from 10 years ago. My new tat  looks pretty cool as hell. So if you want a bad ass tat with great details and not cartoon looking tat drawn by a five year old,  Swing by here.  Its worth every penny. lol..Thanks again Bad Apple."
"Real Donuts are the real deal. One of the best in the valley. The basic glaze donut is spectacular. Everything else I have tried has been quite good as well. They have mastered the art of not having dry donuts in the desert. With the apple fritters and the cake donuts the exterior has a nice light crunch with a slightly moist, yet fluffy interior. Staff behind the counter is always cool too. Why settle for grocery store nuts of the dough when you can indulge in these tasty fried delights?"
"The people who work here are super nice, and I loved browsing the costume stuff when I came in to pick up a prescription (I used to live very close).  They also have a fairly broad wine selection at reasonable prices, and you can sometimes pick up sale bottles for cheap.\n\nI'm subtracting a star because, like so many other local businesses, they're closed on Sunday, which I consider a serious disadvantage in a pharmacy."
There is an asian lady there...that is so helpful everytime I go in. I must get her name!\nLook for her in the store if you need anything.. She goes above and beyond and that is very unusual.
"Every time I go to this restaurant, I receive wonderful, warm, and friendly service. The owners are often shocked how spicy I like them to prepare my food, and often are eager for me to try new dishes that they like to make. \n\nTook a couple friends from Japan there on Tuesday. Turns out the woman who serves our food regularly also speaks Japanese a bit more fluently than I do, so she was able to explain some of the more obscure dishes, and made sure my friends felt welcome. \n\nWill definitely return on a regular basis. Gotta love me some good Korean food.\n\nOh yeah, and they have a TV that always has some Korean drama on it when I go in. Nothing more amusing than seeing people crying or slapping each other like 200 times in 30 minutes."
"Actually wanted to give it a 3.5...not quite a 3 but not quite a 4 either.  I had the hot and sour soup and the mongolian beef!  The hot and sour soup was one of the best I have ever had!  It had tons of flavor and was actually spicy!  I would go back just for that!  The mongolian beef was just ok, it tasted like it was cooked on a burned wok or something.  The decor inside was cute and the little old lady waiting on me was super nice!\n\nI am always on the lookout for a good chinese restaurant so I am gonna go back and try some of their other stuff!"
"""OH!  I could get fat from their chips and salsa!\n\nI love going to Veracruz for lunch!  I work in Oakland and have a number of \""""mexican\"""" restaurants at my disposal (including big chain Chipotle and Qdoba) but will 9 times out of 10 go for the 'Cruz!  It's so much more authentic.  I feel like the chef's only speak Spanish (at least that's how the cashier communicates with them) and there is always some Spanish soap opera or talk show on adding to it's authenticity.  Never usually packed- it's quick and filling.\n\nTotally worth a try!\n\n-10% off for students (or appearing to be under 22)\n-Free chips and salsa with my takeout order everytime\n-Cheap and delicious\n\nLoves it..."""
"These are the best pupusas I've had. The hot sauce and slaw go perfectly with them. I tried Lempira yesterday and theirs were ok, but it left me craving these so I came tonight and got some to go. They are soo good and the steak tacos are also great at $5.99 for 3. The pupusas are the star though.\n\n Sometimes they have a melon drink that is really good and really sweet. I would get it before the meal, or afterwards to go. It's too sweet to drink with food.  My friend got it once by trying to order mountain dew."
"I have been taking my vehicles here for several years.  They consistently have great customer service and short, if any, wait times.  They're always willing to explain things further and they don't push services that aren't completely necessary.  This is a great place to go if you want to get several services done at one place.  I highly recommend them!"
"went here by recommendation of my dearest friend on 13 years. I needed a 2nd opinion and i got exactly what I needed. I will be having surgery soon and will continue my review then.\n\nfor now Dr. craddock was very caring, listened to me. asked appropriate questions and took everything I said into consideration. update to come soon"
"This place is amazing.  I grew up in California, and didn't think I'd find good Mexican food again after leaving.  It's awesome.  They even make their own tortillas.  If you've never had freshly made tortillas, you have to try them. They are so much better than what you can buy in the store.\n\nPlus, they give you roasted onions, cabbage, salsa, and cucumbers with your meal, and the roasted jalapeno is delicious."
"I have three favorite donut shops and I already reviewed the other two so I won't mention them here. This place has awesome donuts! In my opinion it's shop like these that put the chains to shame. The only thing dunkins has is their coffee... that is it. Good stuff... come here and get some donuts, then drop them off at my work!"
"If you see Don Nafi tell him his uncle said hello.  Don't worry but its an inside joke.  If you go to Casa Biance you'll see lots of east coasters eating there.  Its the best pizza in Madison.  Don Nafi owns the place and used to work at the place across the street from Parthenon.  He's a hard core Italian from NY and he knows how to make pizza.  The pizza here is much better.  I think my friends and I ate here 4 to 5 times per week.  Its as good a solid authentic NY slice you'll get outside of the east coast, not just in Madison."
"I live close to the Shiloh and I think I will become more of a fan as they work out some of the kinks.  So far the food has been enjoyable (buffalo chicken dip?  yes, please) as well as the atmosphere.  Having gone to their sister restaurant in Shadyside, I was really happy to see the Shiloh open again.  \n\nMy only complaint is one which will be ironed out in time: the wait staff is still trying to adjust.  For example, the waitress we had when we ate there took quite some time to come back to us to refill beers and waters.  It wasn't busy so I was a little upset about that.  When I went for drinks one night, they only had one bartender and a barback that was not old enough to back-up the bartender when they got busy."
"Excellent food, very friendly service."
This place is trendy cool and they know what they're doing.  I tried Noah and he was interesting to chat with and made some suggestions for hair style that I had not concidered.  I am a bit of a nomad for hair cuts but I think I have found thee place to settle down.  BTW the coffee shop next door rocks too so get there early and add a cup a joe to go too.
"Contrary to the experience some of my friends may have had at this classy lil joint, I had a BLAST! Hahaha. Perhaps it was due to the excessive amount of vodka they put in their vodka cranberries, or all of the good music they played, or how HOT one of the dancers was... anyway, my point is: I will be back. Someday. I will find a reason.\n\nI won't reveal too much about this place because I think the mystery of what it might be like is part of the appeal... but it's totally harmless, and everyone here was really fun. Not too dirty or creepy. It was entertaining and silly. About 10 of my friends and I brought our friend here for her bachelorette party. It was definitely a night she'll never forget!"
My hubby and I stumbled upon this little gem while shopping at the adjoining Harris Teeter. I am a tough critic when it comes to Kabobs coz I grew up in India and had the best street kabobs near my home. But I gotta say that Kabob grill had some pretty authentic kabobs and awesome pillaf! I love the smoky flavor of the meat and the raita (yogurt side dish) was absolutely delicious. It is priced well and we had really attentive service staff. The restaurant itself is non pretentious and has a very homey feeling. All in all a wonderful dining experience....we will definitely be going back
"This place has been around for years and I have to admit that the quality of the food has remained very consistent.  It's a small place in a little strip mall, they have about 6 maybe 7 tables.  Most people come here for take out.  The food is very reasonably priced and you get a ton of it.  I've never been able to finish a portion in less than 2 days.  My favorite is the 6 fried chicken wings (all drumettes), if I remember correctly this cost about $3.75.\n\nThey offer all of your typical American Chinese fare, which we all know is chicken cooked 275 ways and then beef and pork cooked those same 275 ways :)  If you're looking for a more healthy option, try one of the steamed veggie/fish dishes and substitute the fried rice for steamed rice."
"Didn't expect to see this place in the Charlotte Area.  Its a good local outdoor shop right off of park road.  They have a good selection of outdoor clothing and camping supplies.\n\nAs far a activities, their specialty seems to be to supplying kayakers and other water activites.  They had lots of wetsuits, spray skirts, kayaks, and paddels.  \n\nThe climbing gear selection was a bit sparse, but their isn't much need for them to supply that type of stuff.  However you can get cord and webbing cut to length here.\n\nCheck them out if you need some type of camping or outdoor clothing needs."
"I had always been aware that this place was here but never had a chance to stop inside until the Pet Smart down the street relocated... and I am glad they did.\n\nThis place is filled with friendly pet lovers who are there because they like pets, not just for a job. The prices are similar to other pet stores and since they are a local business (I had always thought that they were a chain) they are very personable.\n\nMy dog and I go about once every other week to pick up a new bone and sniff the other animals (only the dog sniffs..)\n\nSummary: great place, but wouldnt go too far out of the way to go to it."
"I stop in here up to three days a week. Right now I'm on the run all the time and I come here for iced coffee and a vegan muffin before my morning classes at Parkland. If I'm in the mood for a vegan deli lunch, I might swing by before work to pick up something. My fiance and I come here together for a monthly cupcake and we love them so much that we're going to have a cake baked for our wedding day. While I do not do my primary grocery shopping here, this is the one place in town I can always count on having that obscure ingredient and the tea selection is to die for. We love the customer service here! Everyone is always in a laid-back, friendly mood and they remember us and what our favorite things are."
Best fried chicken I've had in the area. Workers were super nice and helpful. Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is I thought the sides were just ok.
"Don't be fooled by the location and look of this place from the outside. It's a hole in the wall place :) The food was pretty good- Korean Hawaiian style. I loves the spicy tofu seafood soup. \n\nThe most popular dish is the combo plate, which includes teriyaki chicken and teriyaki short ribs, rice, fried eggs, and macaroni salad. The meat is marinated in a sweet teriyaki sauce and is cooked over an open flame instead of a grill. Other Hawaiian specialties include fried mandu, a cross between spring roll and wonton and Spam Foo Young, an egg concoction made from, of all things, Spam, a popular staple in the island.\n\nThe service was good, I will come back with my family to try some other things on the menu."
"I have been coming to the draft house since I was a little kid lonf before Big Dogs came into the picture.\n\n1. Food here is great no matter breakfast, lunch or dinner. The Walleye is great and the brats do keep me happy. Did I mention the Cheese Curds??? BOMB!\n\n2,  The beer here is great as well...one of the few local breweries we have  and one that didn't let their beer go straight to crap when the big hops shortage went down and the economy dipping. They also rotate some other brews from other micro breweries including other local ones which is a classy move.\n\nI must add that I am a Packers fan so I do haunt this place on that note as well."
"Hello Rocky Point tacos!  That's right, I was driving by this place looking for a used car in a tougher part of town and could not pass trying out their carne asada tacos.   It was just like street tacos.  The service is normal, the atmosphere is what is expected (see picture), the food was pretty cheap.  Don't take your date here but if you are having a craving for street tacos you should stop by."
The love they put into their donuts shines through.  I have had the best Apple Fritter ever here.  They don't skimp on size or flavor.  The Jelly Donuts are oozing with Jelly from the top of the donut.  We get them for our office bi-weekly making my tastebuds happy but killing my diet.  This is what donuts are meant to be.  Keep up the great work!
"I was here on Thursday night and the place was pretty dead, which was actually kind of nice.  There were some guys in the back playing Texas Hold'em and all of the basketball games were on.\n\nWe ordered a basket of the fried mushrooms with ranch and horseradish sauce.  I have to say these are some of the best if not the best fried mushrooms I've ever had...seriously!!!  They were actual whole mushrooms with stems and they looked like they had been freshly battered and fried.  If they were previously frozen then they had me fooled.  The frozen ones are usually the little button shrooms and they are too neat looking to be homemade if you know what I mean.  \n\nThey also have one of the really nice new widescreen touch screen games on the bar that has all the favorites like photo hunt, etc which is always a blast to play!  Also, the Miller Lites were $1.50\n\nThe only thing I've ever eaten in here are the shrooms and as of right now they get 5 stars on those alone!"
"We stopped in for an appetizer and some beer on a stupid hot and humid day.    We were doing some sightseeing in Pixburgh and, of course, had to hit the incline.     Staff was friendly - they have $2.50 Blue Moon on tap on Saturdays!  YAY!   We split the 3 dip app and it was really really good!"
Damn Mike Lee is a great manager and he makes this place a better environment and gives awesome customer service. And he's adorable and cute.
"This shop is amazing. Selection on most days is great. My co-workers have commented how they are glad they don't live near a good donut shop, haha! They wait for me to bring 'em in to get their fix. My hubby is a great cook and he is very pleased with the quality of Donut Tyme's offerings."
"5 stars for bein the only bar in Phoenix where I was first scared to order a drink. but- thats why I love this place. That, and its near the Trunk Space."
"Excellent service, very fair price.  No nonsense approach and nice people!"
"""A downtown Las Vegas landmark for 37 years. Family owned and operated purveyor of award-wining frozen custard dessert. It is a very popular spot for after dinner here in Las Vegas among locals. Parking is adequate there is no place to sit down once served. One must eat their frozen treat standing up or sitting in their car. But for those who may have been sitting all day this is not a problem.\n\nA good place to start on their menu is with the \""""Western Special\""""."""
"My godmother and sister organized my bridal shower to be a tea party here. It was fabulous!\n\nIn the past I'd bought some prints to have framed here but hadn't experienced the tea room. While it's nothing fancy, the service was impeccable (including a very educational and yet super fun talk about different types of teas) and the tea trays were full of deliciousness. Having had many an actual English tea, this really wasn't as authentic as it supposes. But ignoring whether or not it is authentic and focusing on the tastiness, it's just tops!"
"I love the Fish Tacos or Fish Quesadilla, that mango salsa and red cabbage have me addicted! I've been a big fan of this place for more than 10 years, I've witnessed some crazy things happen here that could have easily sent me running for the hills - but the food is too good to not come back! The Steak tacos are my next favorite item.. the burritos have always been a little lacking in my opinion though.. and occasionally the service is less than accommodating, but its a small price to pay when you're hungry for the best fish tacos EVER!"
"""Best place! I've been going here for years. After moving to the other side of town in Henderson, I've tried a few other places and kept thinking to myself, \""""I miss Johnathan and Lani.\"""" They are so friendly and they do great quality work. No matter where I go, I find myself driving back to them. My nails last for 2 and a half weeks every time and always look flawless."""
Ok - I'm going to go with four stars because this is one of the very few places  that I've found you can go for a late night dessert and coffee. The coffee doesn't stand out but the desserts yum! The best part is they don't make it feel odd just coming for the sweets.
"If you weren't in a relaxed, good mood when you got out of your car, you would be, as soon as you walked in. The beautiful wine shop leads to a spacious and open dining and entertainment area with a water view (yup, water view in the desert). Our server was so warm and genuine -- I think we wound up exchanging Christmas cards and recipes by the end of the meal.  Food is delicious -- the heirloom tomato salad could compete with the salads of any celebrity chef on the strip; and the braised beef would be right at home in the French countryside.  If you're dining out in the burbs, put Marche Bacchus at the top of your list"
"Took my parents here because I heard they have a good burger.  The joint is not much to look at and the menu is burgers, a chicken sandwich, chili, or a couple of salads so it's SMALL.  Anyway the burgers came out and we were all so happy we picked this place for lunch.  EXCELLENT burgers at this place and HUGE.  My husband, who is picky, said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.  The staff was also very friendly which made it that much better.  We will definitely go back for lunch."
"This place is GREAT! Got rid of some jewelry I never wear and they got me the beat price for it. Plus they had a variety of items for sale. The staff was friendly and you can tell that the manager, Johnny, definitely takes pride in his staff and store. Wonderful experience!"
I love it for the ambiance. The only fried pickles in Charlotte that I truly like. Delicious sweet potato fries.\n\nYou can't eat here on a regular basis or you will end up obese. This is where you take out of town guests. They are always impressed by the tattooed wait staff and the cheap burgers (or maybe that is just my in-laws..)\n\nThe hummus is surprisingly good and a little spicy.
"This dentist office is beautiful.  Everything is clean, modern, and new.  It sort of looks like a spa.  The couple of visits I've had went very smoothly.  No waiting and everyone was very courteous.  I saw Dr. Askew and he was very nice and did not push me to get expensive procedures I didn't really need.  His hygienist/ assistant was also very friendly and put me at ease right away.  I would highly recommend this office."
"Classic roadhouse tavern that's been around since 1929.  Bartenders are friendly, the food solid (one of the more underrated bar burgers in Madison), and if I imbibe too much, close enough to walk home (or take shelter in the Arboretum if I am feeling like a character from a Jack London novel)."
The employees are nice and helpful. Good amount of selection here. There are chairs in the corners of the store for the guys waiting for their girlfriend or wife to finishing shopping.
"The people that go here are hilarious. People wear the most interesting outfits here, and I think that's their normal attire.\n\nRides are pricey.\n\nCorn dogs are good. I got a turkey leg here once, not bad."
"Great place.  We were heading for another sushi place, but saw this one.   Wonderfully fresh sushi.  The rice was a bit too starchy for my taste, but the service and quaint restaurant made up for it.  The all you can eat is a steal.  Try the mega roll...  Nuff said!"
"GREAT food, good prices.  Really nice staff.  BEST Sesame chicken we have ever had. Definately NOT fast food chinese"
I have been going there to see Larry once a month for several years now. I have arthritis in all my joints and he has been able to keep me moving and active. This isn't the type of la-la massage you get at a day spa. It's real therapeutic massage. They deserve 10 out of 10 stars!! The staff is friendly and Larry is amazing. He is well trained and intuitive. He's kind of a cross between physical therapist and masseur. Do it! Do it! Do it!
"Hidden jewel since it's underground, it has somewhat of a romantic feel (all exclusive and what not). But what I will tell you is that their food is pretty good. I ordered some samosas as an appetizer. Normally I am picky with Samosas since I feel like they are under stuffed . BUT NOT HERE ! \n\nThe waitress recommended me Dorowot. Nice and spicy :) Just how I like my food ! \n\nAmazing service ! -- The waitress I had is such a cutie !\n\nPs. Madison's food options are scarce . Eat here . It's actually good ! Don't do decent ."
"Not that I have many options, seeing as this is all that's left of the big bookstores, but this is currently my favorite bookstore. I love grabbing a cup of coffee and wandering around looking for something to add to my already full bookcases. \nThe store is nice and roomy, and most of it dedicated to books, unlike the store on Charleston, which is 30% kids section, 30% cds and dvds, with the rest left over for the Starbucks and a few lonely bookshelves. \nThat's not the case here. They have a very wide selection of books and magazines, and I always find what I'm looking for here. \nThe staff is also very helpful and friendly. \nIt's not my precious Borders, but it'll do."
"We have only had Jojo's pizza from take out, we have never eaten in the restaurant.  However, every single time we order pizza from this restaurant it is consistently delicious!  The white pizza is amazing if you love garlic, and the crust is thin and crispy with a nice chew.  The red sauce is also delicious.  We duke it out for leftovers the next day!  More expensive than a quick weeknight Little Caesar's run to be sure, but the quality and flavor make the price worth it."
"Good selection of Chinese dishes. The Beijing Beef is so good, I got an extra order to go. Clean restaurant; a good location. Not so many losers on this side of town. Forget about the combo plates - pick what you want, make your own meal. It only costs about $12. Have fun."
"I heard this place was a Vegas favorite and wanted to try it years ago but I guess it closed down for some time.  I was pleasantly surprised to see it on Yelp recently to find that it was back.  My family loved it.  The custard is wonderfully creamy and delicious.  Everyone loved what they ordered.  We all ordered some type of sundae so we didn't try anything other than their standard vanilla custard so I look forward to trying some of their other flavors on our next trip to Vegas.\nBefore dessert, do yourself a favor and visit the taco truck next door for dinner."
"I ate here my first night in Pittsburgh and thought that the Oakland area was so much cooler than it actually was because of it. The food isn't mind-blowing Indian food, but it is pretty damn good - and if you go during Late Night it's well worth the price. Like others have mentioned I love that it is open late, very reassuring in a college town, and the ambience is just fantastic. This is one of the few over-decorated restaurants I don't feel is contrived (i.e. buca di beppo) - the abundance of decor seems authentic and who can get enough of the bollywood videos playing in the background? It makes the wait for the food just fly by. Food is okay but extra points for the experience as a whole."
"Update as of 2/6/14...\n\nTip: sit at the bar if you can, the service will be more prompt and attentive, and it's a bit more warm (in the winter months)\n\nTip #2: ask for the extra spicy Blazing Saddle margarita. It features an even spicier infused tequila\n\nTip #3: visit during happy hour (4:30pm - 6:30pm); two margaritas and two beers were less than $15\n\nLooks like the menu has been slightly revamped; the bar menu features some street tacos that looked absolutely superb. Alas, I was off to Tempest for dinner, so there wasn't any food consumed during this most recent visit."
"This is my favorite used book store ever!  Everything looks nice and clean, not stinky.  They do have new books as well.  Prices are so cheap.  I get lost browsing here.  Great selection of cookbooks & craft/sewing books!  I never leave here empty handed."
"Damn fine BBQ, damn fine. The pork was wonderful - just enough smoke flavor to complement the smoothly rich whole hog pork. Vinegar based sauce may not be my favorite way to dress BBQ, but the meat came out lightly sauced. They have sauce on the table if you want more. The mustard slaw was nice, but the Brunswick stew was not to my taste - it was a bit too sweet and thick. I think it had green peas in it, which might explain the sweetness. Overall very good E Carolina BBQ, with a great staff serving it all up with a smile."
Good place for cheap greek food
Wait where is the one on 35th ave and van buren that is the best
"Love this Pharmacy.  Just avoid their senior days you'll be fine. Cleanest walgreens I've been to, and just a walking distance from home."
"Went out with my wife and the kids last night. Got there around 730 or so. Didn't seem too busy. Walked right in and the hostess was ready and waiting for us and found a nice booth right away. Waitress came by within a few minutes to get our drinks orders. Perfect amount of time. Quick, but not too quick. Enough time to choose what we want. Got our drinks and gave our order. I got the burger with the caramelized jalape\u00f1os.  My daughter got a burger, forget which one, southwest maybe? My son got a corn dog kids meal, and my wife got a trio sampler with the tacos, southwest egg rolls, and something else. Everything was very good and te service was great. I like Applebee's anyway do I will come back."
"For a quick, delicious, cheap (did I say delicious) chicken lunch or dinner in town, look no further than the Roasting Company. Not much decor to speak of, but when all meals come out in under 5 minutes and cost less than $10, fancy decorations are unnecessary. \n\nMy two favorite meals are the chicken and black bean con queso and the half white meat chicken breast. Both are cooked to perfection, and I can get at least two meals out of one order. The corn bread muffins are also very good (be sure to order additional because you'll want more than one - it's worth it at only $0.35 each), and if you go on Saturday, you can get the mac 'n cheese, which has a kick and is my favorite side item offered. The squash casserole and the sweet potatoes are also quite good. \n\nUltimately, I recommend the Roasting Company for a quick meal or takeout on those days where you just don't want to cook or need a quick lunch."
"Great Salon, Excellent prices and you love the work they do.  Ask for Sherry I use her I wont go anywhere else."
Good gyro and good fries.  Sit on the roof.
"This review is a long time coming.  We've eaten there several times, but it's the takeout pizza that keeps us coming back!  Food is consistently hot and great!  yes, it's more expensive.  If you want cheap, there's those chain pizza places.  If you want a pizza that tastes like it was made with real ingredients and fresh, you can't go wrong here.  When the kids are away and wife and I want pizza, we get takeout margarita pizza and it's probably the best in town."
The gyros are delicious and the walls are made of brick.  Solid brick.
"I've been going to John's with my family since I was a kid, and it hasn't failed me yet.\n\nSouthern comfort food as it should be. A variety of tasty entrees with a list of delicious sides to choose from. Always served with a biscuit or cornbread. If you go for dinner, they'll also give you a complimentary (yep, a free) bowl of the soup of the day with your meal. A rarity this day and age, for sure.\n\nJohn's is not going to be your fancy place, or a spot with a crazy fly atmosphere, but it's not trying to be. It's good, affordable food served by nice folks."
"Two locations that makes this doubly good.  Word of advice though, Sundays and Fridays are busy, so be prepared for a little wait.  Wife and I go after work around 4-430 when feasible, before the rush, and we are able to get in, seated, and out.  The chicken is superb, the waffles are golden brown, the catfish is stuperbly bursting with flavors, if you never thought of chicken and waffles, try LoLo's they will change your mind."
"In a world full of nail salons on nearly every block like Starbucks, Y Me Nails and Spa really distinguishes themselves with their friendly services, professionalism, and welcoming atmosphere.  Their reasonable prices are attractive, but clients continuously return for their service. When you're in the area, stop by this salon. You'll feel pampered."
"Comfy little Squirrel Hill coffee shop. I pretty much only order my usual decaf (black) but there is a nice selection of coffee drinks and sweets on the counter. My favorite aspect is the little outdoor patio with lights strung up above. It's the perfect place to spend a summer evening catching up with a friend.\n\nIndoors it can get very crowded with students studying, and you'd be better off if your laptop had a strong battery because it can be difficult to get an outlet. Even with the crowd, though, it never gets very loud because most people have their noses in books and headphones in their ears."
"My order has been hot, fresh and accurate every time at this location"
"This salon is always my go to salon. It's on my route home and once they start on your nails service is fast. The last few times I've gone there has been a bit of a wait, but if you have an appointment it's smooth sailing. I love the staff here and the owner and her daughter are very personable."
"Rather than stuff my quota of *$, I opted to hang out here for a bit and it was the right choice. A plethora of comfy seats all with power outlets nearby. A speedy wi-fi, which was very needed for seven people all nursing cups of coffee while surfing the Internet.\n\nAs for the brew, wow! That's some excellent coffee! Possibly one of the best cups I've had since returning to the US. Rich, smooth, tasty!\n\nOverhead tunes from one of the local radio stations blocked out the clicking of keyboards and the hum of the cooler, interrupted every so often by the bell on the door."
"Food tasted fine, service was good.  Lindos doesn't have a fancy bone it's body even my coffee cup was scratched but I liked it. \n\nI got the breakfast sampler for $7.99 :two eggs , home fries, pancakes and french toast, and bacon.  The french toast was very good fluffy and sweet.  I would have really liked if they cooked the homefries with green pepper and onions but they were tender and I ate them all.  You can have both french toast and pancakes but I opted for french toast only. \n\nI learned that Lindos does a breakfast buffet on Sundays from 8pm-1pm.\n\nThere was a Steeler pride omelet on the menu too. \n\nI also saw a special  for 10 wing dings and fries for $6.50.  \n\nGreat place for cheap eats.   This would be a great place to fill up before a Steeler game."
"The rooms are nice, clean and has a comforting color scheme. Views are pretty and serene. The breakfast is not the usual Hampton In  breakfast with eggs and sausage, it is all high carb or a microwave option. I prefer already prepared and not out of a bag. The waffles are delicious."
Goodness Gracious!!!! let me tell you what! This place is de frickin licious! I had the bbq mahi mahi and the tuna the Tavarue one with the honey wasabi sauce that I'm pretty sure could make a shit sandwich taste good! I can't wait to go back! The service was excellent as well! Sunday at 11 with no wait and food within 10 minutes! Make a bulldog break his chain bo!
"Stopped by this place based on Yelp reviews. I'm glad I did.  This store has great statement pieces (lamps, rugs, chairs) to add to your home.  Plus, any furniture they carry is great for apartment or condo living (not oversized sectionals and massive chests). There is also a section with unique gifts and funny cards.  \n\nStreet parking can be a little tricky."
"""This is by far the best Hispanic bakery in Charlotte. All of my friends from NY and Miami as well as other larger metropolitan areas with a large Hispanic influence, agree. My family who was born in El Salvador, also agrees that this is the best bakery, by far for the comunidad hispanohablante in Charlotte. I'm looking forward to the next birthday in our family so we can pick up one of their cakes surrounded with churros. Yum!\n\nMy only complains were that last time I came, I too was told that I would be given things \""""on the house,\"""" but I'm pretty sure the cashier did not get that message and I paid for everything. I think that it is pricier than other Hispanic eateries in comparison but it's worth it because you do get what you pay for...\n\n\nI second the guava cheese pastries!"""
"Visited this place from out of town and I'm glad I did. The scene was a good mix of people (it was a Friday night) and the service was prompt. The bathrooms were not as disgusting as some have stated ( I have experienced much worse) and I will definatly visit again. Also, the drinking out of the mini pithers was interesting, I think I spilt more on myself and on the floor than I did in my mouth haha."
"Papa Murphys is by far my favorite of the chain pizza available in Las Vegas. I always get the DeLite crust, as it reheats much better than the thicker crusts. You get to pick your toppings, and they have a bunch to choose from. The sauce is good, and the toppings always taste fresh. \n\nLook online for coupons before you go. The website always has some, and there is usually one for the DeLite crust. You can call ahead, but it usually only takes a few minutes if you go in to order.\n\nThe reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they always seem to be out of something. One time, it was the DeLite crust. They stretched the regular crust out instead. They have been out of bacon at least twice while I was there, and various other toppings at one point or another.\n\nBut if you are looking for a cheap, tasty pizza and don't mind cooking it yourself, go to Papa Murphys."
Love this place! My most recent favorite is the steak torta. It's dripping with grease but in a guilty pleasure-type way as opposed to being off putting. The service is fast and the staff are friendly.
I Love this place they have the best Burgers!! I find myself here on random Sundays and the ladies working here are great they have definitely been here for a long time and know everything on the menu!! The food is always great - i seriously always get a burger but we start with the wings with the sauce on the side and they are really good nice and crispy!!  The BF gets the Fried Oysters Appetizer its a HUGE portion and plenty on there that he cant even finish himself!! The only thing I would say negative was we went when it was 100 out and it was pretty warm in there but they cant help it with an open kitchen. Its a great place in a great area!
"I am so in love with the exceptional level of service provided at this diamond in the rough naturopathic clinic! It may not look like much from the outside. Inside the unsurpassed warmth and tenderness is ideal for a deeply enriching, healing experience. I was gifted a 90 minute massage and was not disappointed. The masseuse was knowledgeable and hyper receptive to my needs. I walked in trapped in a bubble of negativity. When I left I was literally floating... I felt cleansed and utterly flawless. Another major plus was that the entire indulgent, spirit lifting experience was under $40. A professional, extraordinary 90 minute massage for under $40?! Seriously go for it!"
"Best gel manicure and pedicure I have ever had, and the staff was very nice and friendly.  They were personable and no wait even though I didn't have an appointment."
"This is a questionable section of town...   BUT so worth stopping in.  The food is amazing.  The menu has both traditional and more exotic Thai dishes.  This was the first place I ever tried Spicy Catfish and it is beyond amazing.  A little crisp from the fry, but not overly breaded, and the fish inside is heaven.  Like flakey buttery goodness.  I have been here now three times and each time I add additional items, but never stray from the catfish.  \nGive it go you will not regret it at all!!!!"
"Good food and good prices...that's all that really matters!\n\nTried the Fried Catfish, Mac N Cheese, and Hushpuppies.  \n\nCatfish was lightly battered and flavorful!  Just the right amount of crunch...right around $7-8lb  :)\n\nMac N Cheese was pretty boring.  Yes, it was super cheesy, but that's all I tasted...no spices....nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nHushpuppies were good though, good breading hiding inside.  And super cheap!\n\nYou might see me here again...during daylight hours!\n\nPics :"
"Well well.. What a nice surprise. I am actually from Florida lived there for the better part of 15 years. when I moved to Vegas I never thought I would have good Cuban food again.. Florida cafe proved me completely wrong... The food was delicious, The prices are fabulous and very affordable. The restaurant was clean. Who would have thought this little gem would lay wait for me inside a rundown Howard Johnson's.. But there it was in all its Cuban glory.  The service was So So wait staff was a little slow and there were only 3 tables. But all  and all not enough to down grade a star.   Vegas does know how to do authentic Cuban food!!!!"
"I LIKE theLove their hazelnut coffee, especially with a donut or two to help it go down smoother....    problem is I LOVE their donuts, lol"
"Selected Dr Michael Moore because he was in my dental plan and his practice was close to my home. The first phase of my treatment plan was to get 8 crowns across the front top of my mouth. The process took over a month and a half.\n  The dental assistants especially Samantha who supported Dr Mike were awesome and very professional with great personalities. Dental equipment was real high tech stuff.\n  Dr Mike is so calm and reassuring when he speaks with you. I felt confident more than anxious.\n  Now that the 8 crowns are in my mouth, I'm ready to give the experience a thumbs up and recommend people to Dr Mike's practice."
"As a new resident to the area I kept asking everyone what was a place most tourists don't know about that is a great place to eat and almost everyone told me Captain Steve's.  I am happy to say I was not disappointed at all.  Upon a recommendation I ordered the captains platter with catfish, fried oysters, scallops, deviled crap, fried baby shrimp, and hush puppies.  Without a doubt the best scallops I have had in years!  And the fried oysters were absolute perfection.  I could not even eat the catfish until the next day there was so much food, but it's was great as well.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is like many of the reviews the noise levels are very loud, but I guess it's from everyone talking how great the food is!  \n\nIf you are wondering should you try it or not.. Wonder no more!  I will definitely be going back!"
"Great Pho.  Time after time I try someplace closer to home and time after time I wish I'd have gone to Pho Hoa. Rich broth, oodles of noodles and just nice guys. Try it, you'll be glad you did."
"Great affordable brunch food. Love is definitely cooked into every bite here. \n\nTheir coffee drinks are also great, nothing like an iced almond milk latte. \n\nI had a burger and it was one of the best decisions I've made in a while. \n\nI'm not giving them five stars because my group of seven had to sit with six chairs at a four person table. I know it's busy, and we are all pretty relaxed people, but come on!"
"They are big, moist, and melt in your mouth good! (That's what she said!)\n\nEasily the best donuts in Las Vegas. Ronald's has never disappointed me in the last 4 years that I have been eating donuts from there. I have never had the experience of buying a stale or day old donut. \n\nI read in the another review that someone said they easily compare to DD. But IMO, you can't even put these two donut chains in the same league because Ronald's easily will blow Dunkin Donuts out of the water. I challenge you to blind tasting any day.\n\nThese donuts are always soft and moist, flavorful, and downright some of the best delectable you will ever put in your mouth. I love Ronald's because the glazes are never too sweet, the cake donuts never to dry, the cinnamon rolls are big enough to feed a small family, the yeast donuts are just on point.\n\nRonald's does not disappoint. \n\nJust don't go here expecting to use your debit or credit card. This joint is CASH ONLY!"
The food is really really good and is not very expensive.  I love hush puppies and they were probably the best I have ever had.  The burgers and sandwiches are all really good and the service is fantastic.  The only problem is that the place is small and the wait is usually long.
"Today I had a pedicure and a gel manicure. Wow!! Theresa was amazing. She knows all the steps and the right spots for massage. Excellent. I'd have to say, it was the best mani/pedi I've ever received. Theresa is very easy to talk too and didn't rush through which helps the client enjoy every single minute. She even used a clear sonic on my feet!!! What?? Yup you heard it right. \nI almost feel asleep twice and told her she should be a masseuse. Book now, thank me later"
"My sis and I came to Vegas for the weekend to visit our cousin. We were hungry from shopping at the outlet and wanted some good thai food. Our cousin Mark recommended this place so we thought hey, since he lives here he should know whats good. Walking inside we were greeted and seated right away, at one of the booths against the wall. We came in about 5ish on a saturday, wasn't busy at all. When we got inside there were only 3 tables that were occupied w/less then 5 people seated. Very clean and neatly decorated. This place wasn't pricey at all, and had good food. They have cute china plates that all match. We ordered family style the sweet and sour soup w/shrimp-kinda spicy but couldn't get enough, wonton cream cheese filling-crunchy and delicious, mongolian beef-was ok, fried rice, and pad thai. Overall experience A+, I would come back here again the next time we go to Vegas!"
Best massage I've had since I can remember. It is a Thai massage that stretches and loosens your limbs and muscles. Very hands on and full body. Had a 30 min massage for $45. I wish I could've had an hour but had to catch a flight. Very different technique from Swedish and much preferred.  In a town where your options are high priced hotel salons or foot massages.... this is the best value for your dollar.
We decide to visit this place because we were googling stuff to do in Vegas and thought it sounded good considering the temps were in the 100's during our visit.  Neither one of us has had custard before but this stuff is GREAT!.  I had the tutti fruiti sundae and my husband had a chocolate waffle cone.  We sat out in our rental car eating our custard and doing some people watching.  We werent panhandled and didnt feel unsafe so i'm not going to ding them for being in a bad neighborhood.  \n\nBring cash.  They do not accept credit cards
"Ginger dragon. 'Nuff said.\nThe coffee is pretty good too.\n\nCome here to chat, it's a bit loud."
"Although there are SO many places in and around Charlotte, and Voci is a standing classic. This is my FAVORITE and best experienced massage loca in the QC. I have only had one particular therapist, Mary R. She is phenomenal people! \nVoci actually made a mistake years back, scheduled me for a neuromuscular instead of a swedish. BEST mistake ever! Now that is all I go for... you will not regret scheduling a massage with Mary R!"
"if it helps, this place really smells like a bookstore.\neven from the street as you are walking by and their door is open."
These gentlemen are amazing.   My son loves barber shops and when we moved I was worried I would have a hard time finding a new place.   This place is perfect and my son came home very happy with his haircut.
"We go to this store the most, for picking up Nutro dry food for our cocker-spaniel and sometimes, turtle food, as well as for grooming appointments- this is probably the best grooming department between this one and the eastern/patrick one (the other one we go to, sometimes). \n\nThe location is super convenient because it's close to a group of strip malls- including stores like Michael's and Wal-Mart. The people working here seem to know their stuff (the products) and they really like when customers bring their dogs, too. There are cleaning stations for, ahem, pet accidents; our cocker-spaniel always has to pee or poop, it seems (did I mention that he is high-maintenance, compared to my 14-year-old lab-pit mix?). Even in the parking lot, there are dog bags for your dog's silly number 2 business. The trash can is in front of the store. \n\nThis store always seems to be organized and clean, too, which is really important. The parking lot is equally in order."
"I am a longterm customer of this Wendy's location. The employees are friendly and the food is fairly constant. They take care of their regulars.\n\nFor the most part the dining room is clean. Occasionally, when they are busy, the dining room gets a little messy, but not bad.\n\nOverall, this is a nice Wendy's to visit."
"""Yum with a capital \""""y\"""" here.  I tried their steak BBQ pizza (which sounds sketchy but it was fabulous) and was very impressed. It gets another point, because it shares the same name with my boyfriend that also happens to be quite wonderful. The crust on the bottom stayed crunchy and it didn't get soggy. It only loses a star because their regular plain cheese slice could have be improved because it put too much cheese on it and not enough sauce."""
"Went there Saturday afternoon for lunch. We were quickly seated. I was thankful that it was not packed with lines like some of the reviews implied. I think maybe the downtown parade had something to do with it. Phew! Ordered the Lolo's chicken and waffles. Came with a breast, a wing, and a thigh. The skin was crunchy and yummy, a tad on the greasy side but still very good. The waffles with butter and syrup was very yummy. Although I think I expected more waffle/crunchy texture and not as more like pancake type of soft texture. But it's still good. I'd definitely go back! I still liked Roy Rogers fried chicken from the east coast way back when the best in my distorted and disillusioned memory. But this chicken is definitely very good."
"There is nothing not to like about this place, great sandwiches and a friendly staff of people working behind the counter.  Forget about the chains and give this place a try you willl be glad you did."
"All I can say is WOW. I enjoy pizza just as much as everyone else. But I like the fact that the pizza is think, airy and flaky.  The sauce is a little on the sweet side but with the toppings I feel it equals out. \n\nI recently went here for a friends birthday and have to say it blows and pizza hut, papa johns or dominoes our of the water. We had the antipasto salad with plenty of vine ripe tomatoes and tons of little bite sized salami and cheese. But as another reviewer said the dressing is a little acidic therefore I suggest using only about half of it. We also had some of their wings; that unlike most pizza joints are of the breaded variety instead of the fried or oven baked. The breaded wings are fried to perfection, light and crisp but are not spicy as the sauce comes on the side. Our pizza was their classic Guy and Doll (sausage, pepperoni, onion) and was fantastic. \n\nFor those who don't normally like square deep dish give this joint a try. I did and have deemed it one of my favs."
Cabo Fish Taco is amazing.  I could inject the queso dip into my arm via IV and be content forever.  I'm so spoiled after the steak tacos that I won't order tacos anywhere else!  Best restaurant in Charlotte.  Great vibe.
"While the place itself is relatively small and kind of a hike from Pitt's campus it is definitely the best pizza in Oakland. Reasonable priced, fast service, good food, what more could you ask for? Also no, don't bother asking for delivery."
"Like almost everyone else, I came here for breakfast and absolutely loved it. Everything is reasonably priced, which is great considering caf\u00e9s downtown tend to jack up their food prices. Everyone working there was really friendly and the food came up quickly.\n\nThe coffee was also pretty darn good, and I loved that it was self serve (when I was there at least). As for the food, I only got a basic one egg meal but the potatoes and rosemary toast are worth going there by themselves.\n\nI'd say the only downside is the high ceilings, which look really cool but cause the place to get fairly noisy when a lot of people are around."
"I absolutely LOVE the food here. I've been twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Both time received excellent quality food. I ordered the CARNE ASADA WRAPGrilled steak saut\u00e9ed in a roasted red tomato sauce with peppers and onions wrapped with refried beans, lettuce, tomato, mixed cheeses, & our southwest mayo. This thing is stuffed and has some girth on it. Its probably in diameter the size of a Monster energy drink can. I could barely finish it. The meat is so tender and juicy and the suace compliments the contents perfectly. I didn't enjoy the Margarita's so much, not saying they were bad, just...different?. I tried 2 different kinds and while the ingredients sounded good, I have to say I'll pass next time and just order a beer. Love the food though!! Definitely go for the food!! I was a little weirded out by the 2 toilets in the bathroom, there are no stalls separating them? So you can either take your pick of seats or possibly take a piss with your girlfriend or boyfriend ;-) in the room with you...if you're comfortable with that."
"I lived in pittsburgh from 2004 - 2006, for a bit I lived on Carson St, and I was seriously at the Beehive every day. \n\nThe prices are fantastic, definitely better than any other coffee shop I've been to. The people that are regulars are fairly friendly, and you can always meet new people here. \n\nThey used to have these amazing spicy peanut noodles that were seriously the best fucking thing ever. I was obsessed. So obsessed in fact that when I moved, I asked for the recipe and they gave it to me!  I don't think they sell them anymore though. \n\nAnother thing that's great is how many different varieties of tea they have, plus you get a cute little teapot for more than one cup. \n\n\nAhhh I miss it."
"I love libraries in any shape or form, but when they're beautiful - it just makes it so much better. They don't bother you if you camp out to study, too."
"As for the Bubble Teas-there is no place better! And trust me, I've been trying to find places all over the US-but, no one can beat Rose Tea!\n\nAs for the food-everything we've tried we love. Good portions. Good spices. Good selections. Authentic!\n\nI am there A LOT!! I see many familiar faces when I'm there-and that says a lot for a restaurant. Everyone I've taken there for the first time loves it too!"
"This place is as good as it gets. You get a beer when you walk in, a TV to watch when getting your hair cut, and nice people to chat with if you want to talk. You usually get in at the time of your appointment, and if you need a haircut immediately they can usually fit you in. I always get a nice hair cut."
I'm surprise about the rating about Tea Planet....it should be more stars....cos to me...is really good...they have a good selection of drinks...I pick different drinks all the time...and is always good...I love their thick toast...and their food is great...I've been to a lot of these Taiwanese boba places..in NYC and SF but this one is my favorite...=)
"The staff here is very friendly, I guess I am kind of a regular, I stop in about every other day and know most of the employees by name.  There are some long waits sometimes but I see past it because I am treated like a valued customer every time!"
"Friendly staff, great service, and I love the fact if you don't have cash they offer you the ability to add your tip to your debit purchase & give you a cash voucher.  My car is clean...until the next rain day in CLT."
"""Definitely the \""""go-to\"""" option for cheap, fast, decent Chinese food when you're hungry.  Very friendly owner who remembers you after just a few visits.  Food isn't always the freshest as it's typical buffet heating style, but go near typical lunch or dinner times when the turnover is the fastest so the food has to be fresh.\n\nMy girlfriend loves the General Tso's chicken and swears it's the best in Pittsburgh."""
"""If you're looking for a quick bite, crave pizza, and don't want to wait 20 minutes for a whole pizza to cook, Fuel Pizza is a great \""""fast food\"""" pizza place.  And despite being quick, it's way better than most pizzas I've tried.  \n\nTheir slices are huge and the pricing is great.  I can get a slice of pizza, side salad (so I don't feel like a total pig), and drink for about $7.  If you're a meat lover, the Extreme Fuel Pizza is the best.  It's loaded with all kinds of meat.  You'll wonder where the dough is!  \n\nDon't get me wrong -- they have a variety of other food options, too, like pizzas for the whole family/group, chicken wings, bigger salads, calzones, etc., but I usually pick Fuel for lunch and get the pizza/salad combo.\n\nAs a side note, I also enjoy the theming of Fuel Pizza, particularly this one on South Blvd.  For some odd reason, I love the thought of eating my pizza in a gas station themed place."""
"I don't very often give 5 stars, but I liked this place and so did my wife.\nAnd if mama likes it - everybody likes it.\nArt deco back to the 30's in a landmark building basement. A bar that lined the wall could have come from a Mickey Spillane novel. The waiter was attentive, funny, professional and spot on with all his recommendations. \nThe couple behind us were fighting, to our amusement.\nThey were a couple of high rolling snobs and the guy, good looking well dressed in his 50's was bending over backwards to get the worlds biggest ice princess to just give him a hug now and then.\nHilarious.\nSo wanted to tell him she wasn't worth it and that he could do better just about anywhere.\nI had the special red snapper with dill laced tartar sauce. A work of art.\nWaiter was uber professional, watered us regularly and has worked there for 6 years.\nthe wife would have liked to see more choices on the menu, but I found it to be part of the over all charm. Just a few dishes done to perfection.\nAnd it helps to have dinner with a beautiful lady."
"Ronalds donuts are good and they even rival Dunkin Donuts. The portions are above average and at a great price. \n\nThe Great thing like others have said is that it is open early (4am-4pm) and the service is friendly and quick. It's a cash only place which kinda leaves this place at a disadvantage.\n\nAs for the taste Ronalds donuts is on my third place as Krispy Kreme being my first place and dunkin' donuts in second place (perhaps it'll change if I try others, hey yelp has R.D. in 3rd). It's better to get the donuts early because the donuts are just so fluffy and tender making you yearning for more plus I believe that's when the best donuts are made freshest because of the new oil.\n\nIt does leave my finger tips a bit oily but it comes with the territory. I can slightly smell the oil that the donuts are dipped in but it's not a big deal. \n\nThey're worth checkin out if your craving sweet donuts early in the morning."
"Went here over 4th of July holiday, so I'll try not to review the thousands of kids there playing games! ha. Definitely a family place. Nice pool area (deep end and shallow) as well as concessions and 7-8 tennis courts, which looked it great shape. There were kids  games and adult activities going on all day and it was very busy. Demographic is definitely family w/kids. My wife and I went there with another couple who are members and they use it for relaxation on non-busy days, which I can see the benefit. You're allowed to bring in coolers, etc.\n\nIf you've got a little extra to spend and don't mind the days with tons of kids, this is a fun quiet place in the Cotswold neighborhood."
"We planned a wedding in 10 days. The easiest part was picking the Chapel of the Flowers. The reviews on Yelp and other sites made me confident they would handle everything and they did. I was very happy with the Chapel grounds , flowers photographer did whatever groups I asked but I didn't get a photo of the wedding party. I would have appreciated the photographer suggesting it. It isn't his fault but it's hard to remember everything on that special day. They arranged a wonderful limo driver Mark who expedited my guests car retrieval by our hotel valets. He also got us to the chapel very quickly during rush hour traffic using side and back  streets. We asked for a couple different things in our ceremony. The minister Al, made it happen pretty smoothly. I had a great time and my new husband has promised me another wedding in 5 yrs. I will come back here. They make everything easy and several guests expected a cheesy Las Vegas wedding were pleasantly surprised at how nice the chapel and ceremony was."
"Not been to a lot of music stores but I love the selection they have and like the folks working here - most are very friendly and explain everything in detail. \n\nAndy in the guitar shop is very friendly too (in spite of always being overloaded) and does a good job with the guitar setups - sometime you need to take it back twice if it isn't set up right but he turns it around in a day so it's OK. And I especially love their 2 year setup plan for about $35 when you purchase a guitar which is a great bargain since you get 8 setups over 2 years - each valued around $30! And you can keep extending the plan every 2 years.\n\nOther departments are very good too, and it's nice to be able to go play an instrument in the store even if you end up buying it online on their website. And they guarantee lowest price too!"
Good service and a decent latte.
Dr Dan Rutz helped me so much with my back.  Went in sore and barely walking left feeling better. Highly knowledgable and competent Chiro.  I feel very lucky to have been referred to him!
"we've been ordering from jojo's for about 6 years. i like the cheese they use here ... very tasty! and the wings ... oh dear, the wings. order them sloppy if you like them with lots of sauce. they deliver to my 'hood, which is rare and appreciated, but truth be told i don't mind picking up my pie because the people working there are always friendly and smart. i should order from jojo's more ... i really should. i kinda forget about them when it is pizza-ordering time, but i shouldn't. there isn't anything unmemorable about this place."
"BBQ Mahi Tacos are the way to go!!!!! I got mahi two ways- one BBQ, one blackened. The BBQ was incredible!!!!!! I didn't love the pasta salad side."
Great service and nice atmosphere.\n\nI had the scallops which were good although a bit rich for my taste (nothing low fat about that dish).\n\nService was excellent. Our waiter was patient with our table (not everyone could decide on dinner selections quickly) and helpful. \n\nWe found a Ramey Syrah on the wine list that was both delicious and reasonable - something you don't find on a lot of steakhouse wine lists.
"""This arbys is a pretty good one to go to. The food is always hot and fresh! The workers are always kind and will deliver your food to your table if you are already sitting down too. I'm a big fan of their Hawaiian bun sandwiches along with their chicken sandwiches. It's not my first choice for a meal but if you are looking for something quick and easy and you like roast beef then this is the place to go. The only \""""bad\"""" thing about this place which I wish they would have is a drive thru since it is a fast food place."""
Very laid back atmosphere as expected but the food was amazing.  The pepper pot calaloo soup is a must and the chicken literally fell off the bone.
"""Has to rank as one of the best Thai massage I've had.  I usually go once a month here at home for Thai massage, but the masseuse that worked on me here at Lavish Spa was WONDERFUL!  Stretched me out good and \""""put a hurt\"""" on me in a good way on my back.  Whenever I'm in Vegas this will be a must visit."""
"Finally made it in here after hearing so much good stuff.\nI liked that they had a range of local taps.  They even had an OMB seasonal I had missed (Bauern Bock) in my wait for the Dunkel to come back.  I like bars that have many Charlotte taps and this place meets that criteria.\n\nI had the chicken tacos.  The chicken was so tender I wanted to eat a plate of it just smothered in Tico sauce.  For those of you who have been to Costa Rica, Lisano sauce is a requisite condiment for all meals and makes beans and rice taste amazing.  Tico sauce is a nice alternative, but I saw a proper bottle of Lisano on the salsa bar as well. \n\nThey must go through a lot of Fireball at the bar because they stocked it by the handle.  I don't know if I'd suggest mixing Fireball and the hot salsa unless you just hate your mouth."
"""My hubby and I stopped here for breakfast while on vacation in Charlotte and we loved it. The waitress was very attentive: making sure we had drink refills before we even finished the first (which went over very well with my husband).  The food was excellent.  THe food portions were huge (I didn't finish the plate) and I was able to take the rest home to eat at the hotel later.  And the prices were super cheap.\n\nThe only reason that I don't give this rating 5 stars is because of the hostess...  Maybe she was having an off day.... She pretty much ignored us when we walked through the door even though there was no one else around, we had to speak to her first before she acknowledged us.  And even then there was no \""""Hey\"""", \""""How you doin?\"""" Nothin. Just \""""How many?\""""  (There's still no one else around...) After we told her \""""2\"""", she just walked off... No \""""right this way\"""", \""""follow me\"""" Nothin...... \n\nNeedless to say our mood wasn't dampered for long, the rest of the experience was perfect."""
"Worth the drive, worth the wait, super delish!  My husband and I had been wanting to try this place for over two years since we relocated to Las Vegas from Southern California.  We never could think of a reason to go out of our way.  Boy oh boy was I wrong to not go sooner.  My best friend was in town visiting and she had mentioned trying something new for lunch.  We had some time on our hands so we drove up on Veterans Day.  You might get lost, it is in the middle of a horse zoned residential area.  There wasn't an item we didn't try, between what I got, my friend got and what we brought home for my husband.  We had chicken, brisket, hot link, ribs, rib tips, mac salad, potato salad, mac n cheese and beans.  My #1 side is the potato salad, don' t be fooled it is one of a kind.  The hot link was pretty much blow your mind.  Sauce or no sauce this is REAL BBQ."
Busy salon at least when I came 5 people working each of which with a guest-- wait wasn't too bad maybe 5 minutes!!!! Pedicure with French $27! Will come back again.
"I really like the food here.  Usually get the crispy beef tacos, rice and beans.  Tacos are a little small but really good.  Got a red tamale once, and it tasted good, but was a little hard and stale like it had been sitting around for awhile.  I want to say a little pricey but the only thing that's cheaper is like a filibertos type place and this is better food than those have.  Always have had good customer service."
This place is the deal great drinks atmosphere so retro you'll think your in 1979 once again. The decor is the mummy's tomb this place is anything but dead. Employees that are old friends from long ago. This will be my favorite bar in Phoenix from now on.
Get here early! Seats fill up quick!\n\nI love this theater. They always play movies for the longest and they oftentimes play movies that you can't see anywhere else. Very roomy and comfy. \n\nPrices are a little higher and it seems to be always crowded. Parking is a nightmare on a Saturday night.
Best ice cream in Pittsburgh.\n\nI love Dave and Andy's. The smell of the place is enough to draw a crowd from miles. With delicious and often experimental flavors there is always something new to try. The price is right too. The only SMALL complaint I have is that the place is a little run down inside. It's kind of dirty and small.\n\nTry the sweet cream-- it will change your life. Highly recommend.
"Decent sandwiches, and a great price for the area. In kind of a run down strip mall though."
"Yay for the AWESOME artichoke pate from the deli! It's always sold out hours before close, so I admit I had my doubts about revealing its awesomeness to an even larger public... but altruism won out. Best paired with the Italian pane loaf from the adjacent bread aisle."
Reasonable priced draft beers.  They have Arrogant Bastard Ale on tap which makes my husband very happy.  Good service.  Bathrooms are fairly clean for a bar.
Dr Lukas is the best. She's very gentle and kind to my parrots. It is hard to find an avian vet in Wisconsin and we are so thankful we found Erika. Staff is wonderful and always kind. The waiting room is always very clean and cozy.
Exceptional all the way around!  Professionaly and efficiently handled from time that i scheduled my appointment until the end of the service. The Doctor and entire staff were friendly and comforting.  I never felt rushed at all.  A+ all the way around.
"""Thank you yelp! I was in Vegas for business and had some time to kill before my plane. I thought what should I do???? Then like a light bulb in the back of my memory I remembered reading about luv-it on yelp. I quickly dialed 411, and cruised my sweet rental car ride up the strip, past the stratosphere, to the little corner behind the am-pm. It was the middle of the day, in the middle of the week, so there wasn't too much of a line, but as I walked up one satisfied customer asked me \""""have you ever been here before?\"""", after I said no, he replied \""""ohhhh, you are going to love this stuff!\"""". I ordered a small blueberry.... and wow! Luv-it was like nothing I have ever had before. Very thick and creamy with a sweet blueberry taste. I only wish I could have tried some of the other flavors, but they only offer a few from their variety each day.\n\nSo.... if your in Vegas with some time to kill, of just looking for a unique frozen treat, I highly recommend checking out luv-it frozen custard."""
Best hummus in town.  The prices are very reasonable and it just plain feels good in the dining room.  Its not fancy (you bus your own table) but the food is excellent.  I've seen it get crazy on game days but the numerous employees do a great job.  The workers are UW students I assume and they're friendly and considerate.  I'm always happy I went.
"The leg snack is the perfect little meal. Chicken is perfect and not greasy, and cheap to boot."
"I live pretty close to this restaurant, so part of the attraction is how close it is....but the food is really great too!!! Not only is the food really good but it is reasonably priced. There are awesome combinations, the enchilada's are great (both red and green), the green chile burrito is super yummy too. Number 9 Combinaciones is perfect, a burrito (red or green) a taco (chicken is great) and an enchilada, I get machaca beef for the burro and enchilada....mmmmmmmm!\n\nI actually have to stop myself eating there on both my days off, so instead I just get waaaay to much one day and have leftovers the next!"
"I drove across town on a hot tip from my brother.  He said I had to at least get a slice of mac-n-cheese pizza, but that I should also try others.  On my first trip, I had the mac-n-cheese and the specialty BBQ pulled pork.  Both of these slices were just down right delicious!  The thin crust was crispy and the toppings were abundant.  The second time I went, I had the Chicken cordon blue and a chicken penne pasta... both delightful slices.  When I had to opportunity to go with my brother, he said that he chooses his pizza by picking the most colorful pie.  I found that to be unique and helpful advice.  They have 10oz plastic cups and a water dispenser for free beverage.  They also offer other drinks from the cooler.  I enjoyed seeing the sign that bragged about the biodegradable pizza boxes.  Truly a unique pizza joint."
"""We played here in the middle of Las Vegas Maintenance Season this week in September so my expectations were not high.  Very nice \""""Scottish / English type clubhouse with nice bar and restaurant - ample ameneities.  \n\nDriving range complimentary balls adequate.\n\nCourse and conditions were very good fairways and surrounding areas while the Greens were a little soft and bumpy which I'm attibuting to maintenace time and amount of play.  Course itself is LINKS cours desinged after 18 famous holes from abroad.\n\nService and staff were excellent.  \n\nWould  not hesitate to play here again."""
"Good food, decent prices.  I like the atmosphere of being outside and getting my grub on.  Nothing fancy and if you are looking for stellar customer service, come on, this is outside BBQ food.  Once you get your food you can find a seat and get to eating.  Some people expect such perfection in every aspect of there dining experience.  The best baked beans I ever had.  The best mac and cheese I ever had.  Amazing pulled pork.  Im from the California Coast and have never tried Texas BBQ.  Some people prefer there Texan style BBQ better.  Maybe I don't know any better, but I thought it was really good."
"I was bike touring through the Southwestern US and needed some parts and repairs in Phoenix. They hooked me up with great service and low prices and even through me some free stuff for the road. Wayne was very friendly, got me in and out very quickly, and did an excellent job with my bike. It has been riding smoothly ever since. Landis has helped make my bike touring experience pleasant. I totally recomend this shop to others."
"I took my mom and my girlfriend here for Mother's day last year and we had a blast. Everything's relatively cheap and it's nice to be able to pick something out, paint it and then know in a week you'll get it back glazed and fired.\n\nThe owner was really nice and engaged us the entire time we were there and, even though I'm not much of a painter, the experience was fun!\n\nThey also know how to handle themselves when problems arise. My mom painted a big fiesta dip platter (why? I'm still asking myself this) and unfortunately, when they went to fire it it cracked in the kiln. They immediately called me and apologized, giving me the choice of either a refund to the card I used or credit towards another session.\n\nWe had a great time and we actually use my girlfriend's creation as a vase! As for mine, we kind of keep it hidden away..."
"I love Cirrus-  their products are great and Stephanie always does an AWESOME job on my hair-  and I have curly hair (not so easy for hair stylists to cut well).  Also, what I like about her is she is really personable, but also will tell you the truth.  If your hair won't look good all chopped off,  she will say that might not be the best option.  I love that."
"What can I write that already hasn't?  Excellent all the way around from service, pricing and taste!  This time I had the catfish.  Awesome cornmeal batter and flavorful catfish.  I took a friend temporarily staying in Phx working that's from Montana.  He wants to come back before he leaves.  Oh, and great sweet tea also, not too sugary, just right!!!"
"This place is great.  The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and the beds are comfy.   We took the double queen suite and it was huge.  In fact the staff bolstered it's image and hype by referring to it as a studio... maybe a slight exaggeration but it did have a kitchenette.\n\nThe room came with two beds, couch, dining table and desk but most importantly, in the kitchen we had two complimentary bottles of water.\n\nIf there was one thing negative I had to day, I would say the scrambled eggs we had for breakfast wee cold."
"Andrew J. and I grabbed boba here before driving back to the OC. This was good stuff! I must admit, I was a skeptic--I almost laughed at the idea of getting boba in LV at first...but now I know. The pearls were QQ rather than soft and mushy, and the tea (regular milk tea) was flavorful, with the perfect amount of sweetness and creaminess. I'll be stopping here each time I visit LV now :)"
"""Ocha is strictly about what is on the plate- deliciousness! \n\nA quintessential example of \"""" A hole in the wall, with amazing food.\""""\n\nThai Beef Jerky is a must!"""
"This review is for the casino and buffet only, as I haven't checked out the rooms yet.\n\nOne of the better Station properties on the edge of town, and it was always the first and last stopoff of mine when driving in and out of town from California.\n\nIt seems to be a step up from some of the other Station properties, but I think it's because it might be newer.\n\nThe casino is huge.  The Station properties seem to do a really good job in keeping up with the newest slot games.\n\nThe Feast Buffet, as at all of the other Station properties, is excellent - always a good spread.  There was one visit when I had a coupon for a $25 dining credit, and the cashiers were very accommodating about adding a few extra beers to the bill to round things off nicely.\n\nDefinitely recommend.  It seems to be situated in a less hectic area of town than some of the other casino properties, but be aware that there's not much in this area of the city, other than shopping centers and restaurants."
"This place was great! The staff on the 2nd and 3rd floors were beyond knowledgeable. The night nurses Pat and Pam were the nicest and helpful people. The residents are really green though, and not sure of themselves. The nurses know their stuff and you should take whatever they tell you as the truth."
"No matter what time of day, the drive-thru is always full, which is always a good sign.  I'm rarely dissappointed & my son loves the play area. I wish their milkshakes weren't so good, as I'm addicted to the strawberry shake!"
"There isn't anything special about the bar itself but I'm still giving it 4 stars because: \n1. $2 taps on Monday nights= some of the best nights of my life. (but get there by 8:30 or you'll wait in the line for at least 45 minutes)\n2. Surprisingly spacious so somehow it rarely feels crowded, even when it's packed. \n3. Dart board are conveniently located where people don't have to walk (more bars should figure out this technique). \n4. When I get drunk, these are some of the fastest and most satisfying cheese curds you can get for miles (not quality, just delicious drunk food). \n5. One of the only outdoor patios downtown and it's big. \n6. Since it's right across from all those crappy bars (Wandos, Brothers, Church Key), most of the douchebags get weeded out and never make it here.\n\nFish fry is also good, by the way, especially when you can enjoy it outside on the patio with a Spotted Cow."
"I used to go here for the fine dining experience with a low price. Their trout was $10 and chicken was $8. That was a couple years ago and this place has boomed with popularity.  They've raised their prices a bit, but its still a great place to eat.  I highly recommend the pecan trout and its a great place to people watch a more liberal crowd.  Dress Nice!"
"Super long wait, but worth it. You don't have to sit in front of the place. They will text you when your table is ready, so go to the bar next door and have a drink. Everything we tried there has been good. It's one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The whole NoDa area is nice. Well worth eating here."
"I love this branch of Monterrey. I've been three times, and I've had fun every time. It's a place we like to go on dates, as it's cheap and you get a lot of food, and the decor is kind of nice. Two of the times we've been, we sat outside and enjoyed the breeze while we sipped margaritas. \n\nThere's about a billion vegetarian options, which always works for me. I see Kelly C. didn't like her chile relieno, but I've always liked mine. I have a friend who lived in Texas for a while, so now she is kind of ruined for NC Mexican food...I've not gotten my taste buds retrained, however, so I am still a fan.\n\nThe patio is gorgeous, the staff is friendly and quick, and the food is good. I would recommend it to anyone, especially for dating!\n\nIt's easy to miss as you're coming down Harris, so make sure you get the directions straight if you don't know where you're going."
"We had about 48 hours to plan an event for 500 people. In a pinch, we turned to the Hyatt Regency, and Lori and her team helped streamline all details from catering to AV to working with the City of Phoenix to secure extra parking. \n\nThe venue is perfect for an event/conference - as the lobby is beautiful, the hotel bar/restaurant Networks provides guests with great food, and the layout allows for great conversation and event traffic. \n\n5 stars!\n\nThanks,\n\nMeghan"
"Just like Hongkong Wok, I'll make this review straight forward, no BS needed.\nStraight forward, cheap, free parking, and delicious and comforting! One of the two most authentic Chinese restaurants beside Fugu (authentic is the keyword here). I won't dare to compare it to the real HK foods in HK, but it's so good for Midwest standard. That's all I have to say about HK Wok.. I love the noodle soup with beef stew, salt and pepper pork chop on rice, beef with scrambled egg on rice are the musts. On weekends, we loved to go there in the morning for the dimsum (yeah, the only dimsum place in Madison) for the tripe, pork congee, chicken feet, fried chinese donut, chow mien, and soy milk. \nDon't expect a good service here, which gives the more authentic feeling. Seriously, if you've been to HK, you'll know that bad service is part of the culture there.."
"I take clients to clubs for lunch when I am in Charlotte on business. I travel all over and was not expecting much in Charlotte. I had gone to one uptown club a few times and it was nice.  I went to a Friday lunch special at The Men's Club from a hotel referral. It is remarkably nice inside, good staff, good music and a better menu than the hotel I was staying in. It was something I would have expected in Las Vegas, not Charlotte. I will go back every time I am in town."
"How could you not like this place?\n\nFun variety of kitchen goodies(prepping, and plating), interesting decor, decent furniture. If that's not enough, wander back to the wines, pick out something new(and relatively cheap), then grab a tasty treat(My recent pick? Crunchy Chocolate Hazelnut Spread. Oh yes.). I also enjoy getting the seasonal beer samplers for my beer snob of a boyfriend!\n\nI will admit, some items are beyond my meager budget, but you can find a lot of steals, too(Sign up for the emails, like Nina O. said)."
I bring my clothes here all the time when I need alterations.  They do a great job all the time.  The price is not bad either.
"Was here a couple years ago and was treated very well. Was back in town a couple years later when my daughter turned 21, was treated equally well. I'm straight and conservative, yet open and accepting of other lifestyles.  Never felt uncomfortable or unwelcome here. Drinks are reasonably priced and has a great local feel to it. Took my adult kids here and had a great time."
"This is the best Hawaiian place I've had in town. I agree with other reviewers that Kalbi is not the best, and it is on the dry side...however there are plenty of choices with more than 35 entrees on the menu to choose one of the more delicious options.\n\nI myself love the affordability of this place; You really do get a lot with your meal---any numbered meat meal comes with Miso soup, macaroni salad, white rice and regular salad or steamed veggies. I especially love Maui chicken special, tofu salad and mango and avacoado salad here--all of these are out of this world!!! Salmon, meat dumplings and noodles are also above average.\n\nThis is by far one of the best lunch spots in town. I would not recommend it for dinner, unless it's a quick affair--the place has a fast-food type of atmosphere. However, if you are not looking to dine in style and just want some authentic-tasting Hawaiian food (this restaurant was highly recommended to me by a native Hawaiian co-worker), Maui Rose is an excellent choice.\n\nP.S. A variety of Hawaiian juices, drinks, snacks etc are offered for sale here that are more difficult to find elsewhere."
"Tremont is your hardcore/metal/emo/indie cement hole of a hotspot.  This place caters to the metal crowd as well as the high school emo kids.  The ticket prices are usually cheap, and they recently updated their bar to include liquor.  This place is typically full of regulars, be they slutty 15 year olds in black makeup (male or female) or 300 lbs ICP fans.  Tremont annually hosts groups like GWAR and the Insane Clown Possie, but they pride themselve on offering a good selection of local acts.  I love to go for people watching and that great dive bar feel, but they occasionally have some awesome acts like the Roots.  Oh, and flirting with the male bartenders can get you everywhere."
Trivia on Wednesdays at 8pm with Rob from Little Dreamer Productions!
"I am 'Vegas born & raised and have been eating here since the 60's. My parents ate here before me. My Mother in law has eaten lunch here every Saturday for as long as I can remember. She also has a margarita in her special mug. My wife and I join her once or twice a month. The chips and choice of salsa always get me ready for what ever I order. The food is not the Mexican food you would find in the spicy-hot places, you can actually taste  the food. I have never been disappointed. Occasionally I run into a local celebrity. Cops eat lunch here all the time."
"SEA BASS HOT POT...sooo gooood.  $8.99 lobster...how do you beat that deal?!\n\nMy family comes here at least twice a month, it's a bit far from the strip but well worth the trip.  I've never been disappointed with any dishes here and just found out it's opened really late.  \n\nalso if you order 4 dishes, they give you free soup and boiled whole chicken.   Definitely worth checking out"
"Thank god this Buca has the old menu!\n\nLinguine with meat sauce\nVeal Parmesan \nFried Cheese\n\nI love their fried cheese, it doesn't look or taste like it came from the Sam's Club freezer. Their Veal Parmesan is also amazingly good for a chain restaurant. It comes out crisp even though it is covered with sauce. I don't make it hear very often due to the abundance of local restaurants in the city, but when it gets late or I am close I have no issue stopping by."
"These people are fantastic. \n\nMy wife and I got a couples massage right before our wedding day.  After several stressful months of planning, working, and me attending grad school, we were walking knots.  \n\nThey are so attentive to your needs and really know what they are doing without you asking.  The gentleman who took care of me, Greg, recognized I had a lot of tension in my neck and right shoulder and diligently worked out several knots from the area.  We left feeling completely rejuvenated and went back just two weeks later to celebrate my wife's birthday.\n\nWhat an amazing experience and wonderful people!"
"Yum.  I haven't had a bad dish here in ten tries, and the chips and salsa are addictive.  What more can you ask for?\n\nEating there isn't anything special other than the food is piping hot.  The dining area is pretty basic.  I usually get takeout, which survives the five minute drive home just fine.  Winners:\n\n* Mexican pizza, loaded\n* Green chili anything\n* Chimichangas\n* Tacos\n* Burritos enchilada-style"
"Rose Tea has a lot of good meals, but if I had to pick one, I'd recommend the Taiwanese Chunk Chicken as simply out of this world.  It's a pot of steaming chicken with garlic and ginger bits, and God knows what else.\n\nAs for bubble tea, I'm a huge fan of taro, and you can request this hot during the bitter Pittsburgh winter.  Almond is also good.\n\nIt can get pretty crowded in there, but waits generally don't take too long.  It's a medium sized restaurant, and tables tend to flip pretty fast."
"AMAZING! Literally 6 minutes and my car was inspected and I was out the door. I heard this place was fast but I didn't know it was possible to be in and out of an auto facility in less than 10 minutes. Fast, efficient, and friendly employees too! Would definitely recommend, especially if you hate dealing with car maintenance, because it's quick and painless here!"
"Luv-it is awesome!\n\nIt's a frozen custar shop down on las Vegas BLVD right in a not so nice area.\n\nIt's hard to explain the four star rating but it's all based on the custard.\n\nMaybe it was just hot, but it really hit the spot.\n\nThey have different flavors made daily.\n\nWhen I went there were four.\n\nI got rocky road and my friend got lemon.\n\nI got them in waffle cones.\n\nFor a 2 of our single scoop waffle cones it was about 7 dollars.\n\nThe cone is big and they fill it through the cone so a single cone is definitely the way to go because after finishing the cone, I was satisfied and not super full. \n\nIt wasn't full of nuts and marshmallows but it was exactly right for me because I wanted the custard!\n\nI'll definitely go back for this four star dessert.\n\nBut! These are my cons.\n\nCash only! LOTS of bums, bad area.\n\nThe small selection is annoying but keeps people going back."
"Called from out of town, found them on Google...Very Pleased with the Service they offered. Helped us pick a plant based arrangement for a funeral. Got it delivered and was told it was very nice! Was able to do everything over the phone and their website was very helpful as well. \n\nHate I had to use them, glad I did!"
I have never had to wait for a long period of time to get service. Free wine!! They do an amazing job at waxing brows. I get gel overlays and no one has done a better job thus far. Love this place!
"This place is worth the wait!  There always seems to be a wait when we arrive, yet it never really seems to be that long. \n\nThe service is always great, they have good hearty food, and strong coffee!\n\nMy hardest dilemma with breakfast is that I always want to try everything! Guess that means I need to continue coming back!"
"We've been 3 times to O'Aces - 1 time to eat/drink in and 2x for take out. \n1st: They have huge portions. So be prepared. You might think you want 2 orders of sliders but trust me, they are more than enough for 1. \n\nWe tried the deep fried asparagus spears and it does prove that deep frying really does make it better. \n\nMy top pick because I've had it 3x is the Ortega Burger with cheese. \n\nWe went for Happy Hour the 1st time and for $30.00 got 4 Bloody Marys, big platter of wings & the pretzel bites (a bit doughy but soaked up the booze in the Bloody) \n\nDecent Bloody Mary - better than most sports bars. and a decent selection of vodka to pick from. \n\nLove that it's an #EatLocal spot, too."
"Beltmann group was amazing!  I have never used professional movers before.  I have moved 30 times and considered myself an expert mover!  They proved me wrong.  From packing, loading, and hauling to unloading I could not have been more impressed!  I had no worries about my belongings!  Our driver, Greg, and Dylan were wonderful!  Kept me updated and so patient with us!  Loved our experience with Beltmann!"
They deliver in like five minutes. Have ordered lunch from there for the past two days at work. Sandwiches always fresh and always fast.  You make being broke ok LOL. Their sandwiches are good and hella cheap. Not the best sub place but hey they deliver and its guaranteed within 15minutes. That makes up for any complaint especially for someone like me who is always so busy that i forget to eat lunch. This place has definitely saved me from passing out due to low blood sugar. Thanks Jimmy Johns!
"I've been coming to this Smith's for many years and I love it. It's outside of Del Webb so I fondly refer to it as Geriatric Smith's but that's a good thing! The store is clean, well-lit, and with wide aisles to accommodate the scooter crowd. It's also quieter than most because it's not swarming with annoying children and their oblivious parents. Plus, since this store caters to the older demographic, I can find lots of Kosher, natural and reduced sodium options."
"When you're deciding on what to order at Cabo, stick with what they do best - fish tacos.  I've had fish tacos from all across the country from North Carolina to California and I can safely say these are some of the best I've ever had.  Always fresh, always delicious.  The taste and consistency is on point.  The chips and corn salsa are delicious as well, although sometimes the chips are a little on the cold side.  The atmosphere is great!  It has a very trendy and hip vibe right in the heart of NoDa.  I usually try and visit earlier in the afternoon for dinner as it gets pretty busy later at night and there's usually a long wait.  It's also extremely loud when you visit during the peak hours."
Nicest Persian restaurant I have ever been to outside of Iran !
I went to this location and the staff was amazing.  I am eating clean and I wanted an healthier option.  The entire staff were involved in helping me choose wat sandwiches would be a better choice.  I love excellent!  Customer service.
"if you or your loved ones have an off-kilter sense of humor, this is a great place to find gifts for everyone. i got my brother a unicorn vs. narwhal playset for christmas here. (i'm not kidding, and he loved it.) they also have quirky baby stuff and coffee table books, in addition to some really well-designed watches/jewelry/housewares kinda stuff. \n\nand yeah, like everyone has noted, it's not cheap. but can you find this stuff anywhere else in town? no. so quit yer bitching."
"This is the bomb dignity shazam shiznitz place I have run across in Vegas.\n\nThe waitress was older, but still had that I use to be hot appeal to her. She was also nice. My father and daughter were there with me and it was our final dinner in Vegasw together before we headed home and I wanted to try something that I never did before. So South American food ended up on the circle of things that may make my fathers stomach churn chart that evening.\n\nOld man had some fish (which is weird since we were at an Argentinian steak house), my daughter for some unknown reason decided to get Lasagna with alfredo sauce (the paternity test did confirm she is mine), I got the ribeye. It was a little slow, not going to deny that, but the atmosphere of the place was nice, people talking, it was almost festive. There was also this really hot looking woman sitting but he door with her boyfriend, but that is another story.\n\nFood was great, the bread was excellent. No complaints.. and the old man had a beer, so you know it was a good evening!"
"I always find something to take away here, from the Willy St. location.  Whether it be a retro denim dress or a vegetarian cookbook or a big leather couch - St. Vinny's is the place to go.  Though their prices are a bit higher than some other thrift stores like Goodwill, their selection is really good - especially for housewares, books, and odds and ends.  I ALWAYS check here for something before I try to find it new."
"One of my favorite restaurants in Madtown.  Good for either a romantic dinner or for some late night food in the bar area.  The steaks are great and are served with a huge doughnut-like onion ring.  I love the hash browns and the shrimp cocktail as well.  Drinks are excellent and the wine list is nice; also a limited but good seafood menu.  My favorite part however is the untouched 50s supper-club decor.\n\nIf you are in Madison, trust me, this place should be one of the top slots on the list.  Disregard any negative review, however the service can be a little on the snotty side, which you should just have fun with because it's coming from 23 to 26 year old poli-sci grad students from Minneapolis."
"Dear Paul, \n\nFirst of all, I'm glad you've been around since 1954.\n\nIn those 60 odd years you certainly amassed a marvelously random assortment of reading material. But random is good, random is the standard jargon for what Madisonians would term 'eclectic'. And we love you for it.\n\nWe find your dusty, wooden shelves to be wholly endearing. Stuffed with all sorts of novels that retell tales both fabled and fact, myth and reality, yet all the while captivating in their accounts. \n\nThere's an almost automatic tendency to get lost amongst your towering bookshelves and the stories that each whispers, while browsing through history and life stories disclosed in written form. There's a natural inclination to relive each account with a vigor, reinstated by the thirst for escaping present afflictions if only for a while. \n\nThank you Paul for the temporary reprieve and the relaxing diversion. Nothing Gonna Change My Love For You."
Cool patio.  This bar has been around for a long time and is a staple of this part of town.  TVs everywhere.  Service can be a little slow when really busy.  The fire pits are great on cool nights.
Pizza is great if you catch them on a good day. It's hit or miss with this place. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. One of my favorite places when the pizza is spot on.
"Great food, great service"
Helpful staff when picking out a 6 pack of beer or a good bottle of wine. The place seems to almost always be busy and for good reason. It is always a good time for at least one of the following: caffeine or alcohol.
"My owner tells me this is the best golf value in the area.  Nice, fair traditional (hence the name) layout without all the houses lining the fairways like most courses in the area.  Good mix of holes with plenty of birdie opportunities as long as you can keep it in the fairway off the team.  Greens are usually in good shape and, even in the summer, don't get to firm.  Staff is very friendly and accommodating but rangers will make sure you keep up the pace of play.  Great practice facility near the clubhouse to hone your game.  Restaurant has decent food and ice cold beer, especially like the Rolling Rock specials.  He also told me there are some otters  that frolic around in the pond near the clubhouse.  Hope he takes me over there sometime."
I love Chipotle. It was one of my favorite chain establishments. I could eat here every day for the rest of my life. \n\nThe people who work at this Chipotle are very nice. They are very generous with the cheese - which is one of the best parts about my burrito bowl. \n\n5 stars. It breaks my heart that people would give Chipotle anything less.
"This is what a neighborhood bar should be, providing a comfortable atmosphere in the bar downstairs, a place to eat quietly upstairs, and an unrivaled patio to pass the many beautiful nights we get here in the Queen City.\n\nThe remodel Tyber went through about a year and a half ago did change the atmosphere a bit.  They went from a true bar, dark as midnight even at noon inside, a bit more light was brought in and some more space made downstairs.  I admit, I do miss the days of the $2 Guinness, but this is still once of my favorite places to grab a pint and a bite."
"I just got a quote on a property in Las Vegas, Nevada and I was shocked at how competitive their prices are compared to other Insurance Companies I quoted from. \n\nChristine was very pleasant and easy to speak with...why can't all insurance quote experiences be this way? Awesome!?!\n\nI will most likely be going with them for my Home Owners' Insurance."
"""This place should be called \""""Cinq \u00e9toiles\"""" because it's that good. \nEverything on the menu is sourced locally and incredibly fresh. I had the Easter Egg radish salad, bucatini pasta and New York Strip. The bucatini was served with a sweet onion red sauce and lobster meat cooked in butter and the strip was THE BEST PIECE OF STEAK I've ever put in my mouth. 21 day aged and local - the farmers apparently know their cattle by name and only slaughter when milk production is no longer possible. \nThe food is presented and cooked with ultimate care and the staff are amazingly attentive. Good wine list - Good location - a must-try if you are in Madison."""
"The soundtrack is incredible. \nLet's start there. \nI could shop for hours if it meant just casually meandering about and listening to the jazzy tunes piped throughout the store. Prices are high, know that going in and you won't rush home to write a 2 star review. There's a sizable nook in the back comprised of a few sale racks and some sale shoes. Big ups for the sale shoe prices. They had some nice looking things today for around $40. I do wish things were merchandised a touch better because it's a little hard to take it all in. The place is overflowing with stuff and paring down a touch to really highlight the awesome threads might make for an easier shopping experience. All in all I'm a fan of this jazz."
"""I call this place \""""The Wedding Factory\"""" because that's exactly what it is.\n\nDespite performing dozens and dozens of ceremonies in a single day, you'd never really know that you're not special when you get married here. They really do a great job at personalizing it to your experience and it really is the most beautiful chapel to get married in in Vegas (despite some of the more expensive Casino chapels, I'm sure).\n\nFriends and family back home didn't have to miss the ceremony because they could watch it online! It was such a neat way to have everyone included but not actually in Las Vegas with us. If you don't go with the Chapel of the Flowers, make sure to pick a chapel that atleast offers online viewing, you won't regret it!\n\nThe wedding planners were patient and informational and I'd get married here again in a heartbeat (but let's hope I don't have to)...   ;)\n\nAnyone can have a beautiful and not overly-cheesy wedding here at not much cost. Highly recommend."""
My husband and I are very impressed with this mechanic. We went to him since we heard all these wonderful things. Come to find out they were right this man is an honest mechanic and he does the job right if something isn't right with your car he breaks it down for you and gives you many options. He's got a customer for Life. thank you mr.west.
Oh Riccio's how I adore thee!  If you are looking for some good Italian fare then you should try this place out.  I've never gotten anything in here that was bad and most of the entrees are wonderful.\n\nIt's worth a trip there for the complimentary garlic knots alone...yum!!  I give them a solid 4 stars because while the food is great it's not really 5 stars great.  Also the atmosphere in the restaurant isn't the best in the world but considering it's in an older strip mall they are doing pretty good.\n\nI haven't tried the pizza before but they seem to sell a lot of them and the wait staff and owners are always super friendly.
"I love My Florist. I miss this place now that I've moved to Indy; however, I visit every few months when I return to PHX. LOVE 1/2 price wine, LOVE the pianist (she is absolutely incredible!), the food is great. My favorite is the caprese salad. But my all-time favorite (I would almost fly back to PHX just for it) is the Chocolate Lava Cake...talk about food-gasm! I never believed there was such a thing until I had a bite of their Chocolate Lava Cake! Be prepared for a lengthy wait on weekends; but its worth it. My girlfriends and I have a lots of memories...as we've spent many fun and sad evenings there (the night before I permenantly left PHX). Ah, I miss My Florist Cafe"
"This is a great place to get supplies for seed starting, seeds, garden tools and supplies. They have a few organic fertilizer options but not as many as a few other places in town. Most of their seeds are their own line which is reasonably priced and grow well. They also have bareroot plants and garden transplants."
"I've been here many times and the food never disappoints.  Is it the best mexicano food in town?  No, but it's pretty good.  I'm partial to the gyros chimichanga, which sounds bizarre but is absolutely fantastic, and the baja chimi, although the latter could use more spice in the sauce.  Overall, a nice experience, and not judgmental at all, I can come in wearing just about anything after a night out at the bars and have never had a problem."
"""Yelp to the rescue.  Was on the way to the airport and had some time to kill....and needed some good grub.  Found this gem and glad I did.  How yummy and legit.  The finer points:\n\n- No nachos on the menu (perhaps they'll make 'em if you ask...which I didn't).  I think nachos are the finest, most perfect food groupe on God's green earth\n- Salsa bar!  And it's so, so, so yummy (careful with the \""""spicy\""""...bc it's actually spicy)\n- Fish tacos use tilapia...which they break up - I think they should leave it whole\n- So the BBQ steak -- it's YUM, actually BBQ flavor which is brilliant with the other flavors. \n\nNice people and cool atmosphere.  WINNING."""
ordered tofu lunch special. it was OK\uff0cnot too spicy. the potion was huge. i was only able to finish half.
Fun locals bar. Had good drinks and entertained by the crowd.  Came here when they had a bunch of old school cars out front and the owners didnt mind u checking out their cars.
"More than a furniture store, lots of interesting bits, from coffee to wine. Lots of spices, olive oil, pasta etc etc, more than I want to type.. LOL.  Many great deals but not on everything so keep your eyes open. There used to be one of these on our side of town, but it closed..boo. I would have given this 5 stars but they make us drive across town now. \nStill worth the trip as some of the furniture and other household odds and ends would be otherwise difficult to find in Charlotte."
"Food is very good...and nice environment.  The only negative is its location, next to a always packed 24/7 Walmart.  Anyway, if you want quality and consistent Mexican fare, come here...as you know you'll get a good meal.  Very family friendly."
"It's big! Rows of stuff, everything from a hobart mixer, to the ninjia blender.  If you want restaurant supplies or personel cooking utensils, this place has it, show your work ID and get a discount."
"This is another highly requested place when friends or family come to visit. Cheap, good for large groups, and always good  service. Come here on an empty stomach because there's a lot of food there's Mongolian, crab legs, oyster, a pretty good sushi selections, sashimi, tempura veggies, and the regular Chinese buffet food, for under $20. They also make steaks made to order, frog legs, Thai tea.  There's not a lot of selection for desserts but who's there for that. There's a lot of space but always gets busy so don't mine if you might have to wait a bit, or just call in advance especially with larger groups."
"Neat place has an old fashioned vibe,great prices,walking distence from The Stratosphere Hotel."
"The service is very friendly here. I usually pick up dog food here. The store is not very clean or organized, but again... The service is excellent."
"My closest neighborhood Tar-jay has recently added a full grocery section even though this store is not large enough to be a Super-Target. In any case, I am pleased because now if I happen to be at Target, I can also pick up a few necessary grocery items without having to make another stop at HT or Trader Joes on the way home.  Plus, when I am looking for a quick microwave meal to take to the office, they have Kashi frozen meals at much better prices than I would pay at other stores.   As a nice bonus, if this Target happens to be out of something I wan, I can drive about a mile or so down Rea Road and check out the Blakeney Target!"
"Island Style isn't a destination-type of restaurant like Lotus of Siam or Michael Mina. It's a neighborhood restaurant but it does a pretty good job with Korean food.\nI ordered the combination plate, which came with ghalbi, meat jun and grilled chicken. The ghalbi was excellent and that's what earns it a four-star rating from me. Really good grilled flavor. The meat jun is like an omelet and it was nice too. The grilled chicken was petty much standard grilled chicken.\nIsland Style is a fusion Korean and Hawaiian restaurant and I guess that showed in my meal with the inclusion of macaroni salad with the meat and steamed rice. It was nice, too. There were only two banchan dishes, white radish kim chee and cabbage kim chee. But the dishes were quite large for banchan. The white radish kim chee was a stand out. It was a pretty good version. The kim chee at Island Style is not especially spicy but still good.\nIf I were to go back, I'd skip the combo and just order a plate of ghalbi. But it looks like there's other good things on the menu, too."
"Shun Lee Palace has been around since I was a little girl. The interior has changed, but not much. The koi painting that I always loved is still there. You no longer walk through a beaded curtain to use the restroom though, which I always thought was so cool!\n\nThe food and service is good. The prices are great. I love the Wonton soup. You can order a Wonton Soup for 2 for under $7.00. Order it to go and you have enough soup to make a couple of meals off of it. Some of my favorite entrees are the sizzling three delights and shrimp with Chinese eggplant. These portions are always large enough for my husband and I to share. \n\nA delicious dinner for two with appetizers and wine under $30.00....tell me what is not awesome about that?  To satisfy those Chinese cravings, go check out Shun Lee Palace."
"Awesome restaurant, dearly miss the Mashawa soup now that I live in Colorado. Great food, awesome atmosphere for first dates and romantic evenings. Highly recommended!!"
"A group of 11 of us met up at Foward Lanes last night for a surprise birthday gathering for a friend. Not only was the company great, but the venue was a lot of fun, too! Yes, it's a little divey - and I was mildly concerned that the stairs leading to the bowling alley were going to collapse as we entered and exited - but it's actually pretty swanky compared to other local bowling alleys (such as Dormont Lanes).\n\nThough the beverage options were limited, there was a little something for everyone with options such as Bud Light, Yuengling, and Woodchuck Cider. The staff was very nice and polite, and the bathrooms were even (shockingly!) clean."
The restaurant was filled to its 28-person capacity on our arrival for lunch with several people waiting for take out.  It took approximately 15 minutes for us to be seated at a small table for 2.  We ordered a couple of soft drinks and shared an order of Tom Kha Kai soup (a spicy coconut based chicken soup with lemon grass and galanga) that was perfectly balanced and delicious.
"Clean, sells 20 pounds of ice for only $2 for when you need ice, nice workers, fast service, quick drive-thru, separated kids' area, and the whopper tastes great!"
"Probably my most favorite Indian restaurant to date, and I've only eaten there once.  The reason for the 4 stars is that the walk to the restaurant was kind of through a sketchy neighborhood.  I didn't feel comfortable walking it alone.\n\nOther than that, I ordered the chicken vidaloo and garlic naan and it was absolutely delicious.  I took my order back to my hotel room, and was quite surprised to see the amount they gave me.  More than enough for 3 people I think.  I did my civil duty (since it was on the company card) and ate as much as I could..  it was divine.  The waiters that worked there were quite nice as well, asking me to take a seat while my order was waiting and offering refreshments.  A+ (except for the neighborhood)"
"I go out of my way to go here for not only the food, but the workers too. Everyone is so friendly. The food is always great and now that they know my taste in foods, they will try to make me a sandwich to my liking without me actually ordering it. They have never failed me. \nThe workers love their job, always laughing and they get along so well. It feels like a family atmosphere when I walk in. \nThey don't take credit cards but they now have an ATM in their establishment. You used to have to walk to a bank for cash, but now everything is under the same roof. Can't go wrong with their food and their waffle fries (special order) are so good."
"Cinemark Movies 10 made my date night SO much cheaper than I was planning. Me and my date wanted to see Tron Legacy (a few months late, I know) after dinner and for the both of us on a Friday cost $4.50! I was pretty impressed. Usually dollar-ish theaters tend to be pretty run down but the interior barely was and the screen had one slight flaw but that was it.\n\nWord is though that at times this theater can be a little on the sketchy side. Personally I have yet to witness this but theres always next time."
"Don't do much grocery shopping but enjoy going in from time to time with my husband, I'm lucky that he loves to cook and usually picks up groceries as needed.  Smiths always has deals, if you are looking to save, they have great 10 for $10 deals, so you can stock up or just pick up a few.  \n\nNot my usual place to shop, we usually do westside, but this was on the way and well, it's fun to try someplace new.  It seems a bit crowded, but still has the great stuff I see at other smiths.  The neighborhood is not your safest, but the store is clean and well kept. Friendly staff and customer service."
"Chicken shawarma. 'nough said. The hummus is divine as well. My friend always orders extra pita bread. Just a consideration for those who like a lot to dip with. The staff is also fun and consists of quite a few college students.\n\nGet beyond the fact that you have to use cash, and you're unlikely to find a seat in the place, and you're golden!"
"Stopped here while waiting on an oil change at the Jiffy Lube nearby. Staff was friendly. My chicken wings were cooked nice and crispy, seasoning was right on. Nice little place, relatively inexpensive. Free WiFi is a nice feature."
"Good pizza! Awesome building!  So-So beer.\n\nThere are better microbrews by a long shot in Pittsburgh such as East End and Full Pint.   The Church Brew Works beer is average at best.\n\nThe pizza is great, the rest of the food is going to be solid as well.\n\nOf course you go here for the fantastic building, and that part does not disappoint.\n\nThis is not going to be your regular haunt, but it's a great place to take an out of town visitor."
Grade: A\n\nNothing remotely bad. Excellent food. Excellent service. Great looking place.
"I was so pleased going here! We were tired of the regular State street bars and restaurants and Amy's was such a nice surprise. Super friendly staff and delicious food. I would have given this 5 stars for sure if the falafel balls weren't a bit dry. Even crummy food would bring me back. Nice people at a nice price. Life is good. Oh and the mystery shots were fun, and deadly too. :)"
"Thank you for a GREAT dinner!  We have lived here for 3 months, coming from Seattle we where used to finding good Thai food a rather simple task.  I was starting to lose hope....we will be back.  Those crab rangoons are magnificent not even I can stuff that much in them! :))) The restaurant was totally empty (i had ordered take out) but the gentlemen that walked in behind me was a regular and said he orders all his food here! Soooo go give them some business!  I went to Lotus of Siam over the weekend and was soooo disappointed I was determined to find some good Thai food! So I did my research online, check out there website! Spiciness was perfect!  I was used to ordering by stars 1-4 which I usually get 3 stars so I ordered a 7 on there 1-10 level and it was perfect.  We tried the crab rangoons (duh), ginger chicken phad thai, and red curry (and a side of sticky rice for my daughter).  NO complaints....."
"I love coming here. The best car wash experience I've ever had. They listen when you tell them what you want, and they do it right!"
Great food at relatively cheap prices. Their steak hoagie is great! I can't tell you about anything else because that is all I get!
This place has everything! Portions are large. Don't order pho soup or Vietnam food . Everything else is good. Great Chinese food. Open late. Good service. Chinese lady explained some meals.
"Penguin is a cool spot. The fried pickles are good as sh?t, the burgers are good also. Good luck finding a seat though."
"This is a very nice and caring vet.  Can always get an appointment - they are very thorough.  Never a wait, everyone there is very nice."
"Today was the third time in 4 years I've been to Rapid Care and each time I've been very, very happy with the care I received. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because of the average wait time, which is well over an hour, since it's primarily a walk-in clinic. The staff are friendly and professional, and the doctor has always been kind, compassionate, respectful and very responsive to my specific needs. Also, since we don't have health insurance and are on a cash-pay basis, he does everything in his power to reduce our costs to the extent possible. For example, giving us medication samples he has on-hand, performing IV treatments in the office rather than referring us to another, more expensive provider and letting us know who carries prescriptions for less. I trust Dr. Gaimaro completely and recommend him without hesitation."
"Driving across the US is part if my job. I stop in big cities and small. Prior to my visit here, a Texas joint was my favorite BBQ in the nation. I'd guess I've tried 40+ joints across the US. I have a new top favorite now and its right here. Im not sure what I like most. Ribs, brisket or sausage. Haven't tried the chicken yet but if its liks the rest of their BBQ....It's on my list to try."
Decent and cheap. Small casino on the first floor. Off the strip. Standard outside pool. If you're on a budget this place will do.
"I wish I could live on Jean-Marc's macarons.  Seriously incredible.  \n\nWe have had Jean-Marc cakes for multiple special occasions, and they are always fantastic.  His buttercream is to die for...actually, everything here is to die for."
Best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas.  Don't have to go to California anymore.  \nThe Pho is phonomenal and the spring rolls are dynomite.  Ice French-pressed coffee with condensed milk will keep you high thoughout the day.  Nice Bun too.
"Really nice place. Kind of expensive (over $100 per couple with the advertised special,) but a decent place for a romantic date night or fun with friends. The cheese fondue is great, but the meat in the entree is lacking any kind of flavor. The dessert is delicious with a plate full of cakes and fruit to dip into chocolate, with an offering of different chocolates to choose from."
"la comida fantastica,de los muchos restaurantes cubanos que he visitado, este es el mejor,y creo que pueden seguir creciendo si se lo proponen.\n\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1felicidadez\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1"
I eat here often..... The food is always fresh and it's close to my house.... Getting a little pricey but still worth it.
"I prefer this store over the one on South Blvd. The store essentially has the same layout and mostly the same merchandise, but this store just seems a little more inviting. The employees are friendly and helpful here. \n\nI love to stop in around the holidays to pick up cool European candies and good items. They have a pretty decent selection of beer, wine, coffee, and tea.  I also like shopping here for unique gifts.  You can put together really cool gift baskets with all the minature gourmet food items."
"As soon as you walk in you are welcomed by a warm vibe and get a feeling that you're about to eat a good, home style cooked meal with love. That feeling lasted the whole time while we were there. Bob Marley pictures on the wall, positive quotes alongside pictures of some well known Jamaican heroes, and several bottled micro brews...one of which was from the tiny micro brew of my friend's brother. \n\nI enjoyed my order of the Jerk Chicken but was VERY jealous of my friend's order of the MANGO RUNDOWN SALMON. TO DIE FOR!!! Ah, I wish I took an order of this home for later. I never thought I'd find myself at a Jamaican restaurant in Madison on a cold winter day but sometimes that's what you need to warm the soul :)"
"It's like stepping into the set of Cheers, only this place is for real. This absolutely has to be the best burger in Charlotte if you like them big and juicy. The many who like their meat brown/black and dry may not agree. They cooked it the way I wanted for once (hint hint) I have mine plain, no cheese just a dab of mustard. Perfect not greasy either.  Got to be chopped sirloin not the usual ground chuck. The fries were excellent too. The menu looks interesting and very reasonably priced for meat eaters. Very cool joint I only wish it was located in my neighborhood, I definitely would be a regular."
"I've been going to these guys off and on for over ten years. Everyone there is super friendly and very knowledgeable about motorcycles...AND they are honest! If you're paying out of pocket, they will do what they can to help you save money. They have a decent selection of used bikes too if you're in the market. I highly recommend them!"
"I'm not a vegetarian but I love this place. One of the few, possibly only places on campus to get a real-food meal made with fresh, unprocessed ingredients. Alot of their ingredients are sourced locally. I started out going here for lunch on occasion but lately I have been going to their vegan fusion dinners."
"If you're a fan of any of Pittsburgh's professional sports teams, this is a must-stop store for apparel and memorabilia. Even the players themselves have shown up before and signed the wall behind the register. \n\nThis monstrous store in Station Square is stocked with jerseys, hats, Polo's, Tees, sweatshirts, jackets...pretty much anything you can put a logo on. Their inventory leans heaviest toward Steelers gear, then Penguins and lastly Pirates, although I'm sure there is much more interest recently than in past years. There is also a small section for Pitt Panthers gear. \n\nAnd of course, there's the clearance rack, which sadly was stuffed with Jordan Staal jerseys. Oh well..."
Fantastic vet!
"Funny how everyone here on yelp is fascinated with the bread at Tutto. Don't get me wrong, it was good but the rest of the food was delicious too!"
"I wouldn't have figured that Pittsburgh would have good sushi, but I have found it.  I was in town for work and wanting something yummy.  I looked it up and decided to go.  \n\nI sat at the sushi bar, ordered an uni and unagi to start and followed that with sushi chirashi.  It was all excellent.  I don't usually get dessert, but opted for green tea ice cream to finish off the meal.\n\nYou should know that it is in some sort of mall.  That wasn't clear, and Station Square has a lot of chain restaurants.  There is a parking garage across from The Sheraton and mall that you can park and walk across the street.  Parking was pretty cheap."
"Why you should go to Trunkspace:  It's a cool artspace that features good local artists and cool local bands.  Touring bands come here often as well.  Because Trunkspace is an independent space you can see some of the weirdest, quirkiest, oddest (read:  uncommercial) music out there.  JRC and Steph are good proprieters and friendly to artists and people attending events.  They stock homemade items and also serve up some good coffee.  Big Plus:  The Photobooth!  \n\nThe downside:  no alcohol is served here.  However, just step over next door to The Bikini lounge for all the cheap swill you heart desires."
"Haven't been here in a while, but have to say returning was like finding an old friend.  Great deal with a coupon, but kind of pricey otherwise(that is for people like me on a budget).  Had the Pullano's Special (about $25) and some wings (40 for around $23).  Also had the large cheese pizzas ($12.99 w/ coupon)  Great food, energetic atmosphere, definitely a great place to grab a slice and watch a game.  We were in a party of 7 and I almost double tipped.  Didn't see that added 18% gratuity until after signing the receipt, so if you've had a few BEWARE."
"So cheap!!! Dinner for $15.99 and all the lobster you can eat! And it wasn't stingy lobster, lobster tails had real chunks of meat. All the other food was good too. They have oysters (cooked and raw), barbecue pork, sushi (although only okay; sashimi was okay, and so much more. They know how to salt. The Mongolian grill was interesting, the noodles dishes they make there aren't very good, but you should try the marinated spare ribs they have, and just have that. This is definitely a place to stop when we'll be coming back to Vegas. Forget Bellagio Buffet..."
"Great staff, and well managed. This is our go-to place for pretty much anything from an oil change, to vehicle maintenance & repair. Overall, this place is an extremely helpful business, and has some great prices (like a basic oil change being around $20... unlike others that want to charge $30+). See for yourself :-)"
"A truly great steakhouse.  Though it took a bit of time, they were able to make the best Vesper I've ever had.  The old fashion was also extrodinary.  When I asked for a very rare steak the server asked if I wanted it black and blue which is the only way to eat tenderloin but few places will prepare it that way."
"A smaller Costco.  Smart and Final has pretty much everything you need.  From utensils to fruit to cereal, drinks, and cooking supplies.  Not everything is in bulk, but its a lot cheaper then Costco.  My favorite item they carry is the Ms. Mays nutty mix!  So good and its gluten free!  I love the Smart and Final on Charleston.  The staff is so friendly and are always helping me out.  I shop at Smart and Final for the work crafty and we are filling up two carts sometimes.  They know who we are, what we do and they let us take over the store half the time. Always are willing to help us shop and load the cart! The store is extremely clean, always well stocked.  I always sneak in buying a few of my own personal items, like celery, which is usually under a dollar for a stalk and the cucumbers which are usually under $.50 a piece.  At a regular grocery store, they are so much more expensive!  I"
Very decent bar food and always extremely quick.
"We picked Royal Crest Cleaners 6 years ago because of it's proximity to the supermarket I shop and it's convenience from where we live.  Royal Crest Cleaners is one of two dry cleaners I regularly bring my and dear SO's clothes.  It is also the dry cleaner of our not too expensive and not  too delicate clothes and silk duvet covers and silk pillowcases.  It is the cheaper dry cleaner of my two favorite dry cleaners.  Me and Significant Other have been Royal Crest Cleaner's customers for 6 years now and I've no complaints.  They've never ruined any of our clothes.  Neither have they ever lost any item.  Cost to dry clean a men's shirt, $4.25.  Cost to dry clean a ladies' denim jeans, $3.50.  Best thing about Royal Crest Cleaners:  you get your items the next day."
"If there is anything I love, it's a dive bar and though Steamer's isn't totally defined as one but it is my replacement to YesterYears.  The staff is spot on (especially Dave - Not only does he remember your name after the first visit, he hustles and provides attentive and thorough service).  The drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is fun.  The food isn't amazing... But it is a bar so you get what you would expect.  There is always a bunch of characters inside so get ready for an interesting experience.  I love Steamers and though it's a ways from my home and I won't be defined as a regular, I  will jump at the chance to have a chill night here!"
"Get here early for lunch...they get filled up. Sandwiches are great as is the soup.  I have moved from Charlotte, but I have never found an egg salad that competes."
"""Man, Lolo's makes some great food. I zealously ordered way too much (and ate every bite). I had the #10 - the Tre Tre - two legs and a waffle, with a side of smothered potatoes. When I asked what the potatoes were smothered with I got quite a look from the waiter. (\""""What a white girl,\"""" he probably thought.)\n\nI got over my original white-girl fear and smeared plenty of hot sauce on my chicken then dipped that goodness into the syrup and wrapped it all in a bit of waffle. Oh yeah, it hit the spot!\n\nMy friends all had similar items, but different sides. The collards are true southern greens, the fried okra is perfect and the beans on rice has great flavor. This is the mother of all weekend breakfast/brunch meals. Delight in its glory!"""
The pizza was decent- we had Deep Dish and they served us very fast. The salads are however small
"Great staff, pretty good selection of equipment. On my second go-around with their training staff, have seen great results. Boot camp twice a week, which is a fun challenge. Really, the only thing keeping it from five stars is that they're in an old building in an old shopping center.  Could use a little stucco and fresh paint. Trainer Alexis is great, really knows how to kick your butt into shape."
"I lived in Madison for a couple years. Now that I have moved away, there are a couple things that I sincerely miss. Sausages from Bavaria Sausage Inc are some of those things. This place is amazing. It is outside the main part of the city, but it isn't too far away. Do yourself a favor and purchase some delicious tubular meats from these guys. \n\nThe cheese is pretty tasty as well."
"""I love this place for breakfast.  Great for a nice hangover breakfast without screaming, rambunctious kids.  No one under 21 is allowed in.  My usual waitress (totally blanking on her name atm) is super friendly and provides excellent service.  I love being able to get mimosas with my breakfast - which never fails to disappoint.  Nothing fancy or special, just delicious chicken fried steak, eggs bennie, French toast and everything else I\""""ve had there."""
"What a great place. It's a little overwhelming when you first walk in, trying to figure out what's going on and what you're supposed to be doing...is it a market, a bar, a coffee shop, a deli?  All of the above.  I was greeted at the door and got a quick explanation about how it all worked.  The Spicy Turkey sandwich was delicious and the guys behind the counter were perfect.  I wanted a local beer and they pointed me in the right direction (it was soo good), and broke down a six pack for my single brew.  Just...great.  Wish I had this place down the street from my house."
"(4.5 stars, but that rates a full 5 for Pittsburgh - I'm still holding out for a mindblowingly incredible bakery here)\n\nCan't believe I hadn't reviewed them - used to live 3 blocks away.  I never picked up a bad loaf from them, and the selection was always good.  Their bread's the best in town.  (Sweets are good, too, but there's plenty of other places in town to get those.) \n\n...Now if I could only get them to open a location Lawrenceville so I could have good bread in walking distance."
I like this place.  I like it a lot.  I'm a sucker for run down places with good food and a kid friendly atmosphere.  I've never eaten anything here that I wasn't happy with.
"Badlands Saloon is not just a country bar and it's not just a gay bar but a friendly towny bar in the commercial center on Sahara near the Strat.  Great place to hang out, straight or gay, great happy hour and they don't always play country music folks.  They have a jukebox with a great variety of music or the bartender will have on good bar music (I mostly have heard motown/R&B).  The bartenders are friendly and pour really well.  They have entertainment on some nights - I do know they do female impersonators late Friday nights.  Since we live nearby, we stop by pretty often and have met some great people, some locals and some just stopping by.  And they do take credit cards now.   They have a pool table and a dance floor too. The only drawback is it is very smoky at times."
Gorgeous. I attended a conference here and was also a guest at the hotel. The staff is on point and friendly. The hotel itself is an extremely beautiful building (especially the ballroom). Only complaint I have is that the lighting in the room was so dim and lacking.
Best!
"Thank you Dr. Goldman and Island Pet Hospital for taking the time to take care of my 2 little dwarf hamsters. Dr. Goldman took the time to explain the tumors and surgeries, along with a risk versus benefit discussion. Then he was able to perform the surgery that same day (I had a morning appointment) and picked up my little girls that afternoon. The staff there is great, very friendly and everyone wants to say hi to every patient that walks through the door."
"Came here with a friend to watch the game and hang out for a bit.  It's in Plaza Midwood, so you can't really go wrong with that.  Drinks were good, bartender was cool, outside patio area was well heated (although they showed every game but the Panthers game).  All in all, not bad."
"Neat aviary.  Nice tropical room with some free roaming birds.  The fancy blue pigeon seems to like children and walks right up to them.  They have some species not typically found in zoos.  I share same quibble as previous reviewer and would add that admission seemed a bit high for the size of the place.  Good docents, though."
I haven't had this in yeaarrrrsss! Still same great food. But the breadsticks are the real mvp!
"A nice small comic book shop fairly close to my home, they have everything nicely organized and have a lot of back issues for sale too. \nIf you have trouble finding something just ask the shop worker and he'll help you find it. \nWhen you buy your comics they also give you a plastic bag and a cardboard backing to store the comic with."
"I love Chinese food and I heard that this restaurant serves good food. The place was clean and the server was friendly and attentive. I enjoyed their food and all I can say is their honey walnut shrimp, beef crispy noodles, beef and chinese brocolli was great but I didn't think their fried rice was that great. Their menus are kinda expensive but I just want to try it. Well see If I will come back to this place again..."
"I've always liked going Outback.  It's about 50/50 for how often we go to sit down vs. taking it curbside.  Both are consistently good.  I love the bloomin onion, I always get a salad with honey mustard dressing, and generally eat an embarassing amount of the bread and butter.  I crave it at odd hours of the day.  The service is always prompt and quick and you never have to spend a fortune for a dinner for two.  I'm a fan."
"Service is great and food has plenty of flavor, just wish it was closer to my house"
This place is awesome! free Wifi! our room was wrong BANG 20 dollar discount!!! front desk always friendly!!! Rooms were super clean and comfortable! Nice view! POOL!! shut the hell up!! This is the best on a budget and free shuttle to the strip!!!
"Really good ethiopian food, and the server was great at explaining different menu items. Food is decently priced, and comes out quickly.\n\nDon't be worried about going down the stairs, it doesn't feel dungeon like at all :) The decor is pretty light and homey; it felt like I stepped into someone's home and they cooked us dinner."
"This place is what a college bar is made of.  You have to appreciate good specials to come here.  On a Tuesday night we got to enjoy the Flip Night Special where guessing the correct the side of the coin can get you a drink for a $1.  Oh, it makes me miss college so much.  It just brought me back so much seeing some poor dude celebrate his 21st birthday that night.  This place is relatively large being that there is a second floor.  It's great for those that are sports fans as it has plenty of tv's and those that like to play darts.  They also sell t-shirts of the bar there - something about fluid research team that I can't get myself to wear or buy.  The bartenders seem very laid-back and nice.  I'd like to try out some of the food here, namely the brats - maybe next time!"
Best Italian in Charlotte? Debatable. But it's pretty darn good. They are definitely in my rotation of go-to pizza spots. The portions and ingredients are good. I will agree they have excellent service. The interior isn't anything special but it's not an eyesore either. Stop by if you're in the neighborhood and you shan't be disappointed.\n\nEdit: They do not serve pizza by the slice. I definitely thought it was important to note that.
Not much to add. An older established Italian restaurant on the west-side. Not snooty. No need to be all dressed up but OK if you wanted to make it special.  Excellent food. Service was great. The Spring lamb ragu on pasta was rich and wonderful. The fresh white anchovy pizza was exceptional. I paired it with an Italian pinot noir/cab blend.  Perfect!  S.U. had seared scallops on a beef ragu on bacalao (salt-cod) mashed potatoes. Wow! \n\nWe're only in town for a few days but I'll try to make it back for another pie.
"I'm from LA, home to Roscoe's chicken and Waffles, and I heard from my friends that Phoenix Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles out beats Roscoe's. Without a doubt they were right.....This establishment over exceeds Roscoe's food. I ordered the Ivan's Chorizo and Eggs and my friend ordered their famous Lo-Lo's #3. I was amazed over their chorizo quality and the way it was cooked; the tortilla was warm and fluffy. The FRIED CHICKEN was tender and juicy; I definitely could not have asked for better food then what Lo-Lo's had to offer. I would encourage everyone who visits Phoenix to make Lo-Lo's a priority when eating out."
"Always a Hooters fan. Rooms are decent for the price. Nothing luxury. If you are looking for cheap and close to the strip, then this is your spot. Also if you love hot wings, then the 24 hour hooters restaurant downstairs is the spot to be!"
"We have struggled to find quality Chinese cuisine in Henderson for many years, but we have found our spot!\n\nWe ordered family style: vegetable and shrimp, orange peel chicken, fried shrimp, and pork fried rice. Everything was delicious. The orange peel chicken was not too sweet and not spicy (unless you happen to eat one of the red peppers). We went in at 9pm on a Thursday (they close at 10pm) and we experienced very speedy and quality service. \n\nWe were given complimentary orange slices with our fortune cookies which was a special treat. We will definitely come back."
"""As a Pitt student, Hem's has a special place in my heart. They are the only bar that I know of that serves shot pitchers which basically is a huge mixed drink in a pitcher water is usually served out of at restaurants and topped off with small plastic \""""shot\"""" containers and gummy worms. My favorites are the Pathfinder and Jolly Rancher. They have a huge selection and there are specials on certain days. The atmosphere of Hem's is casual. I would give Hem's all five stars except it has one downfall which is that is gets ridiculously loud with people yelling to talk to you and the DJ playing music. \n\nMost people go to Hem's for the drinks and to hang out with their friends but do not forget about their bar food. I highly recommend the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich and spinach artichoke dip. If you go there during certain times, they have half off.\n\nHem's is the perfect college bar to hang out with friends, grab some shot pitchers and food, and unwind from the week!"""
"Wow, I thought I had already written a review of Ten Thousand Villages - but apparently, I was mistaken.  In any case, I do love this shop! They stock some of the coolest fair-trade items.  I have bought some really unique gifts here and always enjoy shopping here.  The employees are always super friendly and will go out of their way to help you find that special gift or accent piece for your home.   Next time you are at the Cotswald Shopping Center, stop in and check it out!"
"Hands down the best Starbucks I have ever been to. It's in a nice area of town and it just looks like a house, complete with a front porch. The only negative is the somewhat limited parking. You'll find a spot, but you might have to walk a bit after that."
I just got a great deal on tires on my Acura Integra I drove around and got a few prices and this place blew everybody away he also let me know that I had an issue with my axle and gave me a great price highly recommended
"Nice bright large showcase of jewelry with extremely nice sales staff and a security guard (that's comforting)- I didn't buy here, but my former boss/friend did- it was her favorite place to shop for jewelry. On one occasion, she was looking at rings. Another time, she was looking at bracelets. She bought me a bracelet here, too, but ashamed to say that I lost it (ouch)- if I remember correctly, it was in the $120 range. There is a very large selection here. I don't remember specific prices but I do remember there being different price ranges. And it's nice that one can trade up (being a regular has its benefits). There is another location on the east side, at Sunset & the 95 freeway."
"Unfortunately, this greatest of shops CLOSED !!! Gone for at least a year now."
"I only go for the sushi, and it is tremendous.  I have been eating at Wasabi for 10 years and still love it.  They have new sushi lunch specials that are incredibly affordable.  The always serve high quality fish.  Totally casual.  Great for lunch, and surprisingly just as good for a date.  \n\nIf you are trying to impress someone and you want amazing atmosphere and sushi, this is not the place.  If you just want outstanding sushi, reasonably priced and comfortable place, its perfect."
"i absolutely love michael's! i used to scrapbook a bunch and although i don't anymore, i still could get lost in this store for hours. i find myself visiting once every two months, if not more for random art supplies. for anything creative, michael's is my first choice. \n\nsupplies are affordable, they have goodies i would have never thought of using, and the staff of aunties is always delightful. \n\nthank you michael's!"
"Five bucks + tax to change a simple watch (Skagen) battery.  Was in and out of there in about five minutes.\n\nI feel so re-empowered after visiting this place.  Go ahead, ask me what time it is!"
BEST in Vegas...wish I were there now.\nCreamy cold delicious.  Make sure you have cash...no ATMs nearby.
"Small, laid back, delicious hole in the wall-esque place on State Street. Nepalese has a lot of the flavors I love about Indian, but isn't as heavy so I will always be up for it. \n\nThey have an extensive vegetarian menu which I'm frequently too stuck in my carnivorous ways to delve into, unfortunately.\n\nSome great options:\n1) Get the momochas to share as an appetizer. They're tasty, light dumplings in a tasty tomato sauce. I haven't actually tried the meat-itarian momos just yet.\n2) For entree...well, they're all quite tasty, but I'm partial to the beef buff.\n3) If the dish doesn't come with roti (flat bread), make sure to order some."
"Hands down the BEST pad thai I've tried in my entire life. \n\nIt was my first time having pumpkin curry, but I don't think anything could top the experience here. Chunks of soft, buttery pumpkin with a light coconut milk-infused curry sauce. I wanted to lick the plate when I was done.\n\nNice decor, service was quick and polite, and this place is open late. What more could a college foodie ask for?"
"Was here about midnite on a weeknight:\n- Went with the $18(?) bbq combo platter app.  Options were pork, duck and jellfish and I went with the first two.  Don't know how they do it, but the pork & duck were flavorful.  \n- It's a nice restaurant and an upgrade from the typical Chinese restaurant service/decor, and the menu prices seemed to reflect that.\n- Definitely a good choice to eat a nice Chinese restaurant off-Strip."
An ungodly amount and variety of beer. Belgians are the specialty but there's soooooo much more. Imports. American Crafts. Authentic glassware. Good food. Half price happy hours (!!!). Sharp Edge simply ROCKS.
"The place is clean and bright and the staff is friendly and professional. I like the clear billing statements and estimates. The other reviews cover it all. I have had a few questions with billing my insurance company, and they have cleared it up every time. I love the relaxed feel of the place so much that it makes me look forward to going to the dentist.\n\nExpect them to offer more cosmetic-type services such as whitening because this is where all dentists make money, but it's not a problem.\n\nI LOVE that they play whatever kind of music they want. I'm sure they would let you plug in your iPod to the stereo system if you were ever so inclined."
"No other hibachi compares.\n\nShortly after moving to Charlotte a year ago, my younger sister (who has lived here 5 years now) took me to Ishi and immediately I was addicted.  The food is VERY quick, whether you choose to dine in the restaurant or take out.  Portions are large.  Their crab rangoon is the best I've ever had - stuffed so full of cream cheesey crabby oniony goodness.\n\nThe staff is always pleasant and very welcoming even when you just go in to pick up your take out order.  \n\nIf this place ever offers delivery service, I will be in SERIOUS trouble.....  :-)"
"First tine here. Had their daily special Thai Taste Chicken, which was crispy chicken breast pieces over broccoli and lettuce. The key here was that the chicken WAS crispy. And tender! And DELICIOUS! A little more sweet than heat but enough heat to cause the occasional sniffle.\n\nI just had to also order their house Fried rice. I opted for beef as I already had a chicken dish. This was decent but not nearly as good as the chicken dish. I had to add a little soy sauce to bring out the flavors. But it WAS good. I guess I've eaten at so many great Thai places around the Continent that my expectations were a tad higher.\n\nOne criticism is the lack of a decent wine list! With Asian food they should have some semi sweet whites by the glass to choose from. They didn't, unless you count White Zin in that category. I don't. A simple Cali Riesling or German Spatlese would work.\n\nOverall Thai Taste did not disappoint! I will definitely be back to try their more traditional Pad Thai dishes that everyone raves about! Based on what I had I'd definitely recommend Thai Taste."
I got the best haircut from this salon.  Either T or Tana cuts my hair (they are twins).  I have lived here 10 years and I have never had a better haircut.  I love my hair.
"""My mouth is watering as I think about the \""""Spinoccoli\"""" dish. So. Good. Baked chicken is stuffed with broccoli and spinach (hence \""""spinoccoli\""""), feta, mozzarella, tomatoes, garlic, basil, and served over pesto pasta. It was so much food I could only finish half and was happy to eat the rest for lunch the next day. \n\nWhile we waited for our food, my roommate and I enjoyed the outdoor patio-seating as we sipped our $5 \""""Shaker's Choice Cocktail,\"""" which changes every month. May's was similar to a Mai Tai, and converted me to a pineapple juice fan. \n\nThe only complaint I have is the entrance of the building isn't very inviting and seems like it's only intended for employees. I thought I made a mistake when we walked in and there wasn't anyone there to seat us. I almost walked out when a friendly waitress came around the corner and apologized for not seeing us. Small price to pay for such great food!"""
"My favorite pizza in Madison, better than Ian's and Glass Nickel and Greenbush (that's what that basement place on Regent is called, right?).  Big floppy slices that you've got to fold, and that nice orange grease oozes out and drips down your arm.  Sprinkle on some parmesan, get a coke, tuck a napkin in your collar and dig in.  \n\nI'd say that a cheese slice will set you back $2.50 or so, and the more elaborate pizzas get up to around $6.00 a slice.  Barbecue Chicken pizza is a favorite with this humble yelper, and I think you'll like it too.  Free delivery in the downtown area (but tip well as always!)  Open late"
"""What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This place has tremendous food and will not drain your bank account. I tend to not be a big salsa fan, mainly because of the overly chunky salsa, but their salsa is just the consistency for me, and tastes great. Their enchiladas are amongst the best I've had.\n\nThe thing that gives this place even more of an edge is the service, it has to be seen to believed. Chips and salsa seldom get low before they bring out another bowl of chips, or refill your salsa. The same can be said for their drink refills. There is not a slacker to be found at this place, and even if it is packed, you can be rest assured you'll be treated with efficiency and speed with an energetic team effort.\n\nI don't give out 5 stars easily, but this place deserves it. Not sure how \""""authentic\"""" the food is, but I like to think I know what GOOD food is and this place has that!\n\nP.S. Their margaritas may not have top quality ingredients but they are cheap, and tasty!"""
I found Mr. Brake on Yelp! & was very happy with my experience today. Bill told me how long it would take & the car was done on schedule.  And it was less expensive than a local dealership quoted me.
"Divey hole-in-the-wall, but Salem's has the best damn gyro in the city!  I stumbled upon it after my dad turned me on to this place and...  so good!"
"Haven't been to Chaya since they moved. The new space is a lot bigger and the food is still fantastic.\n\nThe ingredients are all top notch -- right down to the fresh wasabi! Nothing flashy here. It's just authentic, high quality Japanese food. Easily the best sushi in Pittsburgh. The tempura is great too. I need to come back more often to try more of the non-sushi items."
"I love Ulta. What girl wouldn't? Hair stuff, Makeup stuff and perfume stuff all in one place. Most everything is easy to find. The aisles are wide. The store is bright and roomy. They have great prices. You can also get a great deal if you wait for sales and use coupons. I can't really say much on the staff here as I usually know what I'm looking for but I've never had any problems checking out or returning anything."
"Who doesn't like cheap drinks and good Mexican food?  It's the perfect combo.  Plus, the portions are large enough that I couldn't finish mine, which is usually not the case.  :-)    Make sure you come here and check it out!"
"This is a great steakhouse tucked away just off 215 on the north side of town. It isn't extravagant or expensive... just really stinking good. Their steaks are high quality and cooked perfectly. They have an excellent wine list that isn't overpriced. No need to get dressed up to eat here, but you can if you want. Make sure to get the ranch house potatoes as your side. Delicous!"
I needed a coffee fix last night before heading out  so I stopped here for a quick drink. Decided to go with iced white mocha w/ raspberry... also known as a raspberry cheesecake. Yum! Anyways I ordered from the drive thru and there was only 2 cars in front of me but when I got to the window to pay the sweet lady told me that there would be no charge because of the wait time! Seriously I didn't wait that long?? She said I waited about 8 minutes and apologized again and asked if she could get me anything else. I declined I was just happy for the free drink. I thought that was super cool of her and I will for sure be back!
I got the Chef's Special Pumpkin Curry with Chicken ($10.95). Very good curry sauce though a touch too sweet. Generous amount of Asian pumpkin chunks which were tasty. The chicken was very overcooked and chewy. I'd recommend this curry though. \n\nTheir spiciness scale (1-10) is conservative FYI. I got a #6 and it wasn't very spicy at all...I would have called it a 3 or 4. Service is good and the place is nice on the inside.
"Southwest Airlines...You will always be my first choice in air travel! I flew with another airline to use up an existing ticket...but whenever possible, I'm sticking with Southwest!"
"""I love Lo-Lo's. It is definitely worth the trip to the \""""hood\"""" to sample a bit of their exquisite southern fried decadence. I had the 3 pieces of Chicken Southern Fried w/ 2 side orders & cornbread. I chose the mac n' cheese and sweet potatoes. Everything was amazing. No. Make that \""""a-MAH-zing\"""". The chicken was cooked perfectly--tender and juicy with a crispy coating that had a nice \""""pop\"""" of seasoning. The mac n' cheese actually had cheesy flavor. All too often, restaurant mac n' cheese leaves me wondering \""""where's the cheese?\"""" Not so at Lo-Lo's. The only (only!) complaint I have is the portion size. It was WAY TOO MUCH!  I wish they had a two piece/two side combo, or even a one piece combo. As much as I like fried chicken, I'm really a sucker for the sides. Lo-Lo's does both very very well."""
"Hello Friends,\n\nI like TW a lot. I won't try to type some new review. It's enough reviews that probably repeat. \n\nKegs!!! Probably the best prices on Kegs from my travels.  $70 deposit. (1/6, 1/4, 1/2 & whole kegs)\n\nWine & Beer tasting & classes. \n\n\nTTFN"
Simple yet delicious burgers.
"The Pho has a tasty base with plenty of meat. For those who do not care for Pho, this place has plenty of other dinner options. Pricing on the menu is very fair for what you order.  This location is always busy, and they are able to keep up with the pace. I recommend and don't forget to try the iced coffee.  It's great for those who love a great caffeine jolt!"
"Doesn't get much better than this for breakfast.  I shared the asparagus omelette and sharing is the way to go, unless you haven't eaten for a few weeks. Bacon side, which was thick and juicy. Pancakes went down very well on our table. And service was excellent - stopping by to check on coffee every five minutes. Now I need to try and walk to the car..."
Very good food but not a place to go if you are in a hurry. Habib is a very gracious host and explains the entire menu to you if you are a first timer.  It is a very nice restaurant with classy decor. Definately a good place for a fancier dinner date or somewhere to go if you plan on having a conversation with your dinner companions. All of the reccomendations by Habib were wonderful dishes.  I had the lamb and it was so moist and tender and the rice was a fantastic combination of spices and herbs like I've never had before.  The hummus was ok and the pita bread warm and fresh. If I'm in Vegas again I would definately go back.
"""Big Jim's is a classic. I discovered it when Jim was a patient of mine at then Montefiore Hospital. Joyce was fierce in her management of his care and I first had their food when Zippy the postman ( a friend of theirs) delivered pizza on my shift.  Joyce found me an apartment \""""in the run\"""" and that was it. I still have 4 of the original jackets. Live in London now but hope to get there the next time I visit the Burgh."""
"Actually a really good place for breakfast! Not been there for anything other than breakfast, so my review is limited to that only.\n\nGood size portions, decent quality, fast, friendly service at reasonable prices. What more could you want?\n\nRecommended!"
"This place is an absolute gem.  The two guys who work here always do a great job and their prices are more than fair.\n\nI first found them about 6-8 months ago when I needed my golf shoes repaired (the sole had become mostly detached from the shoe).  They fixed those shoes and since then I've brought them some other items to repair and shoes, boots, and bags from both my wife and me.  They have a knack of bringing back shoes from the dead and making them more than presentable...and always for less money than I expect.  I will continue to use their services as long as they are there.\n\nCould not be more highly recommended!"
Best cab company by a lot.  Greg took care of us all weekend.  Arranged for a second cab because we had too many people.  I highly recommend Greg and this cab company.
"Food is reliably very good.  The owners run the place and recognize regulars.  Lots of vegetarian options, the food is authentically middle eastern.  The humus and tabouli are excellent.  If you bring your own plates, they will present your take out as if it were your own.  The kabob are always good, get the garlic sauce for the chicken."
"The Whip rocks!  Yes, the most recent owners have really improved the quality of the food and maintenance of the bar and restaurant.  The food is excellent.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a dive.  This is not a 4 star restaurant so don't expect that type of food.  However, it is not a redneck or biker bar either.  The Friday night fish fry is worth the trip.  The breading is light and the fish is flavorful. The burgers are also very good, and the service is excellent.  The atmosphere is simple but clean.  On a weekend night all the locals gather to drink and eat.  It parallels a German pub being the social center of the area.  You can see 3-4 generations of the same family at the Whip at the same time.  So if you want to see the real Wisconsin rural pub seen, stop by for a beer and a tasty meal.  You won't be disappointed."
"Talk about a literally hole in the wall restaurant! However I went here for lunch today and found myself a fresh, unique treat! I ordered the gyro plate served with steak fries and side of zesty yogurt dip. You can tell from my picture that the food just looks so fresh. I was able to wrap up my own gyro with some lettuce, tomato, and shaved lamb-beef meat. Mmm it was a light, perfect dish for my belly!!!!"
Some great service in here on my visit. Like the fact that at a dollar store everything is a dollar unlike most dollar stores. Well lit store everything was easy to find and shelves were in order so I will visit again.
"I definitely enjoyed Lo-Lo's, but I don't know if part of it wasn't just because of the novelty, and how much I wanted to like it. We went on a Sunday after church, and it was PACKED. We had a very long wait (which told us it must be pretty good!), but the kind people of Lo-Lo's were kind enough to provide us with a shade structure and mister-fan to combat some of that infamous Phoenix heat. They even had a water cooler with cold water for us to enjoy while we waited, so that we would not swoon from heat exhaustion.\n\nThe food was tasty, that's for sure. I ordered one piece of chicken breast and one waffle. Both items were DELICIOUS! Thank goodness Lo-Lo's knows how to make their namesake dishes, and make them well! I felt like my meal cost a little more than I would have hoped, for just a piece of chicken and a waffle. It's worth going there, though, for the experience."
They have a really good beer selection that's unique and diverse. The coffee is quite good here too! The only downfall is this place is it can get a little crowded but I guess that just speaks to how cool it is.\n\nI love little places like this.
"I have been going here to get my feet done for the last 10 years.  They are very detailed and get upclose and personal with your feet. All pedicures and manicures come with the wax dip, which is extra a many other nail shops. The best times to come are the weekdays, but even when you come on the weekends you don't have to wait to long.  They always have ample staff to do nails and feet.  The pedicure chairs a plentiful and the motors on the massagers are strong.  They also have a full service salon.  Offer waxing of eyebrows and body waxing."
"""I gave it four stars for a few reasons. First because I think you should always support local business instead of feeding the corporate beast. Second the atmosphere is really laid back and not too pretentious like other coffee shops( Chicago, Boston, NY.). Free wifi, can't beat that. The coffee, in my opinion. is just as good as any other \""""brand\"""" name coffee. The pastries are pretty expensive compared to the drinks. The atmosphere is definitely college, but they have nights for poetry, music, etc. There is also a Ice cream shop, that's really good. It does have out side seating, not sure if it's year round. Definitely check it out it may become your getaway spot!"""
"I know the family, they're cool as ice! They're very welcoming, great food, always leave satisfied, very clean, and reasonably priced! Great for a party of 2, or 22, they accommodate always and never have an attitude problem with a request. Every waiter helps out if your water is empty, its filled promptly, as well as other drinks."
"This place is tops.  We've had two kids go through college at UICC over a span of seven years, so know the area accommodations well.  The staff change periodically, but the Champaign Hampton Inn has been a model for excellent, friendly, responsive service. The rooms are comfortable and well-maintained, the free breakfasts are very good (and convenient), and the location could hardly be better.  The price is reasonable; you can sometimes pay less, but the quality is unmatched.\n\nOur experience here has led us when travelling elsewhere to always look first for\nHampton Inns; they've all been good, but this has been the best."
"As far as Walmarts go, this one is decent enough to go to on the regular. I feel that the items are well stocked and the checkout lines are not too long."
"Hired this company (Local Phoenix branch of North American) to move from Phoenix to Houston. I had multiple companies give us a quote, not only was Beltmann the best priced, they were the most informative, friendly and professional. The movers did a fantastic job and our stuff arrived earlier than expected. My price was also reduced as our belongings weighed slightly less than quote. Other companies completely overcharged. No damage to our belongings and nothing missing. I HIGHLY recommend this place for your move."
"The food is great and the waitstaff always polite and friendly. Sitting up near the window at night is perfectly cozy. Late drink specials are a nice bonus. My only tiny issue is that I wish they offered more vegetarian options...I love the pastas and toppings-loaded veggie burger, but I would love to try something new. No matter, I do enjoy going there and would recommend it to others"
"Best hardware store in Vegas , possibly ever! Staff is awesome and knowledge.  Blows my mind how much stuff you don't even know you need that they have. Only place I ever go."
"Service has improved significantly since my last few visits.  Wait time is shorter, service effort has improved dramatically, and communication has also increased about the status and health of my vehicle.  Great job!  Feedback does work!"
Very good car wash by hand then wax by hand prices range anywhere from $13 to $200 depending on what you want everybody in Vegas likes a clean shiney car
"""Googling \""""best places to buy a Christmas tree in Vegas\"""" led me to this little spot. It's essentially a corner Christmas tree lot operated by the Las Vegas firefighters.\n\nThey have several different types of trees (Douglas Fir, Noble Fir, Grand Fir, etc.), a variety of sizes, and all looked to be very nice (much better than I am used to seeing at your average Christmas tree lot). And the trees were fairly well-priced. 5ft-6ft trees tended to be around $59. 6ft-7ft trees tended to be around $79.\n\nThey also sell wreaths, garland, tree stands, etc. And apparently have been selling Christmas trees for over 20 years.\n\nI'm very pleased with the tree we purchased. And we opted to have it flocked - which turned out great.\n\nThe firefighters were very helpful and nice. The woman at the pay booth, though, was a tad rude and unable to answer any questions.\n\nAll in all, a good experience and a great tree. And I like the fact that the firefighters are involved. We'll be remembering this place next year."""
"Superstar Video was there when home video began (I remember when they had a Betamax section), and it'll be there when it ends!"
"As is usual with Presidential, their people, their cars and their service are really very nice.  Tony picked us up in a shiny black Escalade and he was an extremely nice gentleman.  On time too and took care of all the luggage.  When it was time to leave Sin City, Glenn met us at our hotel in an equally beautiful black Escalade.  He took care of everything and was a very gracious gentleman.  Presidential is the way to travel when in Vegas.  It's all in the details and they do it right every time."
"Its actually a Salvadorean restaurant and not Mexican food. Its family owned and it offers a no frills dining experience. However the service is fast and friendly. In and out quick dining. Everything is prepared by a mom and her daughters in the kitchen and it has the feeling of a restaurant in a small Salvadorean town. Their Pupusas are the best in the city hands down. I constantly order them to go when ever I am in the area and their Tamarindo drink is made fresh everyday.  The pricing is fantastic: easily feed four people for about $20. If nothing else the pricing, Pupusas, tamarind and speed of service makes me a fan."
"Pleasantly surprised. The food here is actually pretty dang good. \n\nIt's tucked behind Bojangles and Chik-Fil-A, so you might miss it (you can actually cut through the Chik parking lot) Friendly, family-run, solid chinese food. I really couldn't have asked for anything more. The General Tso's Chicken was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. No grislte, no fat, no mystery meat. Beef w/ broccoli was tender and just enough sauce; not goopy or oily. Broccoli was steamed green, not brown and packed neatly for take out. Excellent quick service too.\n\nNothing innovative, but if you want some rub-your-tummy chinese...hit it."
"I've gotten 2 piercings here, my naval and my cartilage on my ear. Overall, their service is great. They are friendly and professional. It been a long time since I've been here ( I moved out of AZ a few years ago) so I'm not sure how things are now, but I when I went in 2005 and 2006, they were great. Recommended if you want good service and quality jewelry and professional piercers."
"Wow, first to review.  \n\nThis electronics recycler was a pleasure to deal with.  I spoke with Tom Holland who was very professional.  The pick up went smooth and they took everything from CRT's, old computers, old batteries, and circuit boards.  Another bonus is if you mention the school that referred you (Hancock Elementry), part of the money goes to the school.\n\nJust trying to do my part for the environment."
"""This was my first yelp-recommended restaurant in Vegas, and the crowd-sourcing didn't disappoint.  We found it on a mission for vegetarian- and carnivore-friendly Thai, and the 6+ page menu offered something for everyone.\n\nHave had a couple of entrees here that were really good (unfortunately I don't recall exactly what I've had each of the couple of times we've gone now).  The pad thai was fabulous comfort food.  I was told the tofu curry (with heat cranked up to \""""10\"""") was awesome.\n\nMy only complaint about them is that each time we've been there it has taken 30-40 minutes for the food to arrive.  I suppose it's a good sign really, implying that everything is being cooked freshly, but it can make for a really long wait with no food."""
The Dutch baby is insanely good with butter. \nSpinach omelette is big and delicious. \nCoffee is just ok.
"""In the mood for Italian, we found this little placed tucked in the back of a shopping center.  You know it is going to be good when the person walking out as you walk in say, \""""Boy that was yummy!\""""  It has a nice authentic feel and the service was very attentive.  The brushcetta was excellent and they even pronounced it correctly.  Baked pasta was so tasty.  The marinara sauce was homemade.  Short rib was so tender, the fork glided through the meat like Michael Phelps in the water.  The only negative was that it took forever to get the check."""
Just great!  I have boarded my 3 dogs and cat here and they come home so happy and healthy it's like home away from home for them.  I am able to relax when my husband and I travel for work and can't take our fur-babies.  The staff is helpful and friendly and always ready to give me an update while we are away.
"Noticed this on the way home from 168 Market, located down North and across the street. Place was decorated with native style furniture and bamboo accents. Typical Filipino Buffet style entrees. They got a good selection of tradtional Filipino eats and fairly priced combos/to go containers..\n\nSinigang na pork (soup/stew with vegetables and pork):  Good amount of pork with just the right amount of sour and salty broth flavor that's so heart-warming!\n\nCaldereta (beef stew based on tomato sauce): Tender and Tasty pieces of Beef with its Succulent sauce makes for a Very Successful rendition of this dish! \n\nBeef Steak (stir fried / boiled beef slices and onions): Explosive Flavors of garlic, lemon/ycitrusy sweet and soy sauce infused within the thin fall apart beef slices and sauteed onions. Extremely Tasty!\n\nCrispy Pata (deep fried pig): How could this not taste good.. Crunchy, Chewy and Porky! Dip it in the soy/vinegar sauce and Enjoy!\n\n2 Thumbs Up!! Pretty Good Filipino Restaurant!"
"Way above expectations.  What do you expect when you get a hotel room for $25?  I didn't expect friendly service, a very comfortable room and a great time.  The hooters restaurant is just what you would expect.  The $10 prime rib at the Mad Onion was wonderful and I loved the all night pools!\n\nDefinitely a great home base to stay, grab lunch or late food and play while in Vegas.\n\nAnd it is close to most major hotels!"
Sarah is one of the best stylists around Vegas.  She deserves the title master stylist.  My highlights look awesome and she tells you the price and what she is going to do before she starts working on you.  I would highly recommend giving her a try.
"Come with an empty stomach, the portions are huge and the service is awesome."
"With as many as four dogs in the last few years, we have definitely made use of the services of Matthews Animal Clinic.  They've always been very helpful - of course, they get paid for it, so you can't blame them - but they've always gone above and beyond to do the job, too.\n\nMost places will give you decent service, but the staff at the clinic always recognizes our pets by name after just visit or two, and when we recently had to put our oldest dog to sleep, several of the long-time employees, who had worked with him for years, recognized him and seemed to be genuinely sad.  They even made up a doggie-blizzard for him, with kibbles and ice cream.  It was pretty cool (no pun intended).\n\nI would suggest making an appointment rather than walking in if you can, because it will get you to the front of the line, where if you just walk in you get at the back of the line, but that's not always possible."
"I've always enjoyed Sir Edmond Halley's sure it's changed a little bit the food isn't quite as good but they have a decent beer selection and make good drinks.  The service is friendly and I had a delicious veggie sandwich.  They had quite a few healthy options on the menu and that will keep bringing me back.  It's always nice to go to a pub & have options besides cheeseburgers, wings, & french fries.  However if that is what your looking for dig in they have plenty of typical pub food on the menu.  \nThis is a great place to come and meet some friends for drinks or grab a quick bite to eat before a movie.  It's a little hidden - your best option is to park behind park road shopping center."
"This is about the best friend chicken you can find.  I think they brine the chicken first, because it's got a salty flavor. Chicken was crunchy.  Hush puppies were to die for.  Really good.  \n\nPS - Bring cash."
"Really loved Ishi when they were at the old location, because it was cozy and always full. Since they moved they have a bigger place, had to cut costs on certain items but the sushi and hibachi is good and not too expensive. Saki bombs are cun there!"
"I love Poyeye's!  More spicey and much more varity than a KFC.  Chicken, fish and shrimp - it's all good."
"Best service in town, maybe in the world.  This newly blossoming empire around town also serves up the ultimate hangover cure, especially when complimented by a Propel.  Store that fact away, it's a useful one."
"I agree with everything Neil stated. They were very knowledgable with Hondas. Saved me money from going to a dealership for sure, while still using OEM parts. Fast turnaround too. I caught the lite rail back home...very convenient!"
"This place is delicious!!  I love that it feels as if you're walking back into time, and the food- lets just say its nice to pay $30 for a plate and get your moneys worth.  I'd love to give it 5 stars but the joint needs a deep scrub and a little updating.  And the landscaping and parking lot needs an overhaul.  I'll be back!!"
We have had a contract with National Home Warranty for approximately 9 years and it's one of the best investments we've made.  They are courteous and professional at the office as well as the technicians that have come to our home.  I particulary like the ease of using the plan.  They call you 30 minutes in advance to inform you the tech is in route which allows me to leave work and meet them WITHOUT having to wait around the house all day waiting for their arrival.  The annual fee is reasonable and they mail you in advance and allow you to make the payment in (3) installments without charging additional fees.  The combined annual fee that I have paid over the last 9 years is still considerably less than all of the items they have repaired or replaced.  I have recommended them to several friends and neighbors and will continue to do so.\n\nSusan S.
"As someone who has been trying a lot of Vietnamese restaurant in North America, I would say that Saigon Noodle's Pho is relatively comparable to all other good restaurants out there, and certainly the best in Madison.I've had better ones, thus the four stars but I still come and eat here often whenever I crave for a hot, delicious pho. \nI always get the one with everything in it (no. 19?) but if you are a beginner, I would suggest trying the pho with some beef steak (ask them to make it well done), flank steak, or the meatball. \nNot a pho fan? You can always come here for the rice or rice-noodle dishes (my fave is the one with grilled chicken and spring roll). Not feeling hungry enough? Try to super yummy Viet spring rolls with peanut sauce (non-fried, with shrimp and beef slices inside)."
"Pasta, wine, cheese, meat, desserts, frozen, fresh...you name it, this place has it. Small place right next to the Sundries on Providence. I hard to pass this place and not hit it up for a visit on the way back home. I don't think I've ever spent more than $20 here, but it's a fun place to walk around and walk out with a couple items you think you need. Either way, I'm making Italian in the next few days due to a visit here...not a bad thing! \n\nDo yourself a favor and visit soon. Tip...Parking is usually full in front, but there's a back lot with extra parking."
I come here pretty often when I'm craving pho. Especially a nice big bowl of soupy goodness after a night out on the town. I sometimes take my parents here for lunch or dinner because they love noodles. They always like coming here. It is packed here no matter when I'm here but I barely have to wait. I love that as I know everyone else loves to eat here too but I won't have to sacrifice for that validation.
"Luv-It has become somewhat of a secret lately, and it's kinda a fun one.  Everyone used to know Luv-It.  It's been around FOREVER.  It's where you went to get frozen treats, man.  Located by my high school, we'd stop off and grab a cone or a cup before heading back for class.  It was 1995, my shoes were chunky, and I had a cone of Luv-It.  Life was awesome!\n\nSeriously, if you've never had frozen custard, get some Luv-It.  If you've had frozen custard, get some Luv-It because I bet it's the best you've ever had.   People in the desert can make themselves some tasty, tasty frozen treats."
"Went to Los Tacos on Sunday March 22.  I made sure to Yelp a mexican food place before we drove to Vegas, and was not at all dissappointed with Los Tacos.  The food we received looks exactly like it does in the photos that some have posted - which is what I was looking forward to.  I ordered the loaded chicken taco, my husband ordered the not loaded carne asada tacos and a chicken quesadilla with a side of rice/beans for the kids.  We were so hungry when we got there, but so not hungry and happy when we left.  Everything was very fresh and staff was friendly and yes, they are bi-lingual which we appreciated.  Yum.  :)"
"I first learned about this place several years ago whilst watching a show on the Food Network about local and little-known  'foodie' havens.  In the years since, I managed to drive by the Bob Taylor's Ranch House sign off of US 95 (at Ann Rd) countless times without ever exiting and checking the place out...that all changed today, Mother's Day 2011.\n\nReally, really good food.  Exceptionally friendly and meaningful service.  \n\nHad the NY Strip with Ranch House Potatoes.  Perfection on a plate.  Only giving 4 stars because 5 stars, to me, should only be given to best-in-class establishments.  This place is certainly among the best I've experienced in the non-gourmet steakhouse category, but it's not the clear, undisputed leader."
"Great deals, just ask. His name isn't Mad Man for nothing!\n\nUPDATE 9/15/2013: Mad Man Army Surplus has moved to 3300 Rancho, near the corner of Cheyenne.  New stuff, same Mad Man. Seems easier to find merchandise now."
"""OMG. This place is heaven. My friend- who is a local, had planned to take me here for breakfast before dropping me at the airport. Now- I had been entertaining clients the night prior and may or may not have had too many martinis. So I may or may not have been seriously hungover. Which could explain why I took a picture of my coffee-cup (see pictures). The coffee was quite a welcome taste. NOT \""""bad diner coffee\"""". I ordered Eggs Benedict and (yes AND) plain buttermilk pancakes. OMG. Everything was perfection. The food is a thrill- soooo delicious. My friend said they don't have hashbrowns- as you can see in the picture, you get potato pancakes. Yummy. I did NOT even peruse the menu- but I could see they have TONS of pancakes, omelets, and pretty much every breakfast concoction you can imagine. Honestly- I'll be here EVERY TIME I am in Vegas- for a cheat day of course. (Yea, I'm one of those fitness freaks that watches what I eat 80% of the time, so this is a cheat meal in a big way.) So worth it."""
"Over 50 types of Tequila? I had no idea! There are actually tequila's that are triple the price of a bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne. Their selection of wine was also quite good. Alcohol aside, the pork chops were perfect. 2-3 inches thick and succulent. I wasn't all that impressed with the cheese enchilada, but that is more my fault for deciding to try something that I normally don't eat. So, the pork chop gets a five star!"
"We had another nice experience here for yet another wedding anniversary, though this time it was just for dessert. Seating was available immediately but we had a good 10-15 minute wait for our server to show up. We didn't receive any of the special treatment this time: no rose for my wife, no card, no slice of cheesecake with our fondue.\n\nThe chocolate fondue here is excellent - however the graham crackers mixed into the s'mores tend to suck up all the fondue. I would have like to see it presented with a light graham cracker crumble on top instead of the large cracker chunks. \n\nThe Chocolate Fontini was excellent."
"Can't believe I have not been to this place in all these years. Good spot. Local mom-n-pop set up. Meat-and-two type of place. The grilled pork chops were great, and all of the vegetables as well. Casual atmosphere, like the Plaza in general. Great food, personal service. Has a patio out front as well."
"Wow.  Can I just say, wow?  There are so many good things out, so let's just list them....\n\n1. Fair prices.  Fantastic.  I have been overcharged by other vets.  I can get my dog seen, treated, medication and food for him for under $200.  Yup.  Just to let you know I have an English Bulldog, that is nearly unheard of.  \n\n2. Really nice staff.  They actually care and like dogs.  They have a smile, given him treats and some nice cuddles when we go in.  \n\n3. Great hours.  They are open until 9pm.  Yeah, I know.  So for those of us who can not run home, pick up our dog and then race to the vet before five, there is hope.  There is this place.  \n\n4. Yes, ok, it is a little out of the way.  However, they are great.  They are nice.  They are affordable."
"My two daughters have been going here since 2010.  My youngest is moving on from Pre-K to Kindergarten this year.  We used Creative Kids for both pre-school and after-school care and have been very happy with the quality of care and teaching our daughters have received.  My oldest daughter did full-day kindergarten this year and Creative Kids had her prepped well for Givens Elementary full-day kindergarten.\n\nI recommend this Creative Kids to all my friends and co-workers looking for childcare.\nWe will probably try Safe-Key this year as our daughters are older now and we have family in-town often that watches them, but if it is not a fit then we will go back to Creative Kids.  (Safe-Key allows you to pay by the day, and if Creative Kids had that option then we would be staying put, but for our family paying by the day is a significant savings due to all the days we do not need childcare.)"
"George is the best!  Been going to him for years.  He treats his clients with the utmost respect, witty conversations, a friendly manner and excellent haircut!  The shop is in a great place close to the capital and restaurants.  Will never go anywhere else!"
"If you want some snackies for a road trip, or to sneak in the theatre or even just to have, SunVille Bakery is the place to go.  I like going here for their lunch-time snacks.  I always get the little smokies, or the Ham & Egg sandwich thats only a $1.50. I'd rather go here and get that than go to McDonalds and get a Sausage Biscuit... OK i'd probably get both, but still, i'd enjoy SunVille Bakery more. \n\nDoing this review is making me wanna drive there right now, but i live pretty far from chinatown and I'd wait if you were gonna settle for less.  \n\nTheir packaging is nice and neat and keeps the product sealed fresh.  On a side note, I think Bachi Burger gets their buns from here. You'll see what I mean when you see most of the bread."
Had lunch here today. The tuna tacos were fantastic and the chips and salsa were some of the best I've ever had. Had the cabo toll appetizer and it was good but honestly not needed with the free chips and salsa.
"Hola, comida deliciosa! Talk about generous portions, affordable prices, and great flavor...yes, please! \n\nAfter reading previous reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. However, in my experience the place was very clean. In fact, the servers were cleaning off tables when we entered and when we were leaving they were wiping down the menus. They stayed busy cleaning. Extra plus in my book. \n\nThe portions must have changed too. Like I mentioned, they were good sized and I left with a too-full belly. The veggie burrito was huge and around $5...for dinner! The salsas were good, chips fresh, and I really liked the individual salsa cups with a mini jar to pour your own. \n\nI really liked the bright colors and the art on the booths; it made the ambiance cheerful. The service was very friendly too. Need to catch up on a novela? It's playing in the corner. If you are in need of some chicle, you're in luck, they have that at the cash register. Tip: No rush to pay, just go to the register when you're ready. \n\nWhat a difference a year makes! I think this place has turned things around and I plan to return."
"- Kombucha: yum. \n- Bulk food aisle: good variety, and they have carob chips (try them, they're like not-as-bad-for-you chocolate chips).\n- Samples: yesss.\n- Salad bar/prepared foods: delicious. \n\nAlso: little ends of various cheeses, so you can get a variety for about $0.75 each, and caramels in the checkout line (the sea salt caramels are decadent).  Yes, they're expensive."
"Food is fantastic, service is quick, atmosphere is like chipoltle or baha grill, very clean, set up for speed not ambiance.  Prices are a bit high but everything is fresh and made to order."
"Came out for a UYE a few days ago and the beer was very good, from what I remember.  :)  My alcohol tolerance has been a moving target these past few weeks.\n\nThat being said, the Tenaya Creek IPA here is really good as is the War Dog IPA that they carry.  I think it is cool they sell other beers besides their own.  One person in our party got the beer sampler with the groupon and the display they use to serve it is really cool.\n\nI'm a little bummed they don't serve food so they can have smoking.  They have a vending machine in the corner if someone gets really hungry.  And I've heard they let you bring outside food in.  I'll definitely be back to try more of their beers."
"Jambalaya.  Oh my goodness.  The jambalaya.\n\nI had to make myself stop eating.  I ate my left overs at 11am the next day, I was so excited about it.  \n\nThis is a really great little casual place.  I don't know why I never came in sooner.  I came here for date night last week and it was really nice.  Our server was on top of things, super helpful and constantly refilling water.  (Sometimes, I drink water like a mad woman).  The jambalaya has a little bit of everything in it; chicken, sausage, shrimp, craw fish.  It's amazing.  It's one of the pricier things on the menu, but a million times worth it.  \n\nI need to come back here for the hurricanes.  An entire menu devoted to them?  Yes please.  I'll update my review after that!  \n\nSee you soon, Boudreaux's."
"This place makes some good chewy pretzels and the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  I liked the pretzels so much that I ate 5 of the 6 I bought within an hour...I was trying to save them for later, but things like this happen when food is addictive and good."
"This little neighborhood drug store is tucked away in the Cotswald neighborhood just down the street from the Pizza Peel.  I used to shop here and get RXs filled here when I worked in the area.   Employees are very friendly and helpful.  While the store is nothing on the scale of a CVS, Riteaid or Walgreen's, you can find greeting cards, medical supplies, vitamins & supplements and a limited selection of other drug-store items."
"I like nam's. Their portions are big, so I usually end up taking my food home. I find myself coming here a lot (usually alone lol but that's okay because the waiters are nice). I used to usually just get plain fried rice with some sort of chicken... Usually orange chicken. But now I'm HOOKED on their pineapple chicken fried rice. IT JUST IS DELICIOUS. Give this place a try!"
"""I've actually been coming to zenith even before I moved to Pittsburgh (I've lived here since July 2013). For the most part, as long as you don't mind sharing a table with other customers, you can get seated reasonably fast. All of their buffet and entree food has been delicious. One thing I do not like is that not all their entrees are vegan even though everything on the buffet is. Prices have gone up over the past years, but I totally understand that. This is an awesome place for brunch to bring \""""out-of-towers\"""" because not only is it a restaurant but also an antique shop."""
"Cash only. My only issue.\n\nI love their red sauce. Just love it. A large bag of chips is $3 and comes with 12 oz of the sauce. A small bag is $2 and comes with 6 oz of the sauce. It's the best red sauce I've ever had.\n\nI love their carne asada, but my girlfriend doesn't like their cheese so I go myself now."
"""Super cool course in Vegas, but you swear you are in the motherland.  It is actually a collection of several classic holes on the British Open Tour.  The Club House is like an old Scottish castle.  The Course is very much a links style, super difficult pot bunkers, no trees or shrubs of any kind.  The cart paths are also not paved, just dirt and rocks.\n\nSome of the inspired holes consist of: the \""""Road Hole\"""" and \""""Hell Bunker\"""" from the Old Course at St. Andrews and the \""""Postage Stamp\"""" from Royal Troon.\n\nAn \""""unoriginal\"""" course, but a great idea - only in Vegas..."""
Good food at a reasonable price!  Bloody Marys are delicious!  Watch out!  They're spicy! Our server had a bit of an attitude but that probably won't keep us from coming back.
"I had my first experience here recently and had a great time! Ordered wings and then an appetizer sampler to go along with a few brews while waiting. The service was enjoyable and friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming. The only minor criticism would have to be the platter, I expected the batter in which everything was fried to have more flavor but sadly, it was bland. There wasn't much seasoning on any of the platter and the marinara tasted cheap and bland as well. The lack of flavor in the batter made it impossible to enjoy or really eat most of the platter but, I'd try it again in hopes that it will improve. Will definitely return to try more of the menu!"
"I consider myself a connoisseur of fried food.  And while that may not strike some people as anything to brag about, Cajun Yard Dog acts as proof that there is a right and a wrong way to fry.  And by God, they do it right.\n\nI could go on for pages about this place, as it's certainly my personal favorite in Charlotte.  But I'll simply mention the sides, service and the beer.\n\nMost entrees are accompanied by 2 sides.  Those sides range from collared greens to sweet potato fries, from gumbo (extra $) to some of the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten.  \n\nThe service isn't always fast.  But even someone as picky as I am about service will be pleased by the friendly, knowledgeable waiters. \n\nThe beer selection is pretty phenomenal for a place of this breed.  Lagers, Ambers, Fruit beers (including Purple Haze from Louisiana's Abita) Porters, Stouts,etc.  Basically, even micro brew drinkers can consistently find a beer that they've never tried.  \n\nIf you enjoy spicy food, fried food, good food or good beer, do yourself a favor and try Cajun Yard Dog: Charlotte's creole connection."
food + service = excellence
"I have eaten at this specific Taco Bell many times before. The service is excellent, the staff are friendly, and they have never messed up an order! You can really tell that the employees here are not mad or rude like you often see at fast food joints, and are simply pleased to serve their customers\n\nAs far as their drive thrus are concerned, I have used their drive thru before and I haven't had the lengthy wait times many have complained about, but I guess I could have just gotten lucky!\n\nOverall, if you live in the CU area, this is definitely one of the better Taco Bells to visit!"
Food was good.\nService was even better.  Got that family feel.\n\nPlease support this business.  We're happy we stopped in for a meal here.\n\nThey are a family run business but they are located quite a ways away from the strip.\n\nUPDATE 1/3/11:  Just get the pizza.  Had a meatball sub which was good but not worth $7 or $8.  My buddy got the pasta.  Not worth $12.  My wife got a mini-pizza and was very satisfied with the pizza quality.\n\nUPDATE 1/5/12:  Secret pizza in the Cosmopolitan Hotel is a lot better.  But also costs a lot more.
"Had my sister's birthday dinner here.  We order 5 dishes and ate with rice. \n\nI thought the dishes were good and the portions were pretty good size.  I can't remember the dishes that we got but the chow fun, Mongolian beef, dumplings, and chicken fingers(sweet and sour chicken with the sauce on the side apparently) were really good.  \n\nThe dining area was clean, nicely decorated and lighted.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was walking into the dining area and have tables full of white families staring at you like they never seen an Asian person before.\n\nI would definitely give this place another try."
I freaking love this place. I love coming to Vegas for Aloha Specialties because there aren't many Hawaiian food places in Cali. But we decided to try it and I never knew how well Island flavor could be done with a Korean taste. Came here the next day as well I wish I could give this place more stars.
"Madison, WI is not necessarily known as the epicenter of great Mexican food. However, Casa de Lara is a solid option if you are really craving some. While the service won't knock your socks off, everyone is nice and the food is pretty darn delicious. \n\nInsider tip: Try one of their margaritas. Then have another. Repeat this process until you leave with a smile on your face."
"My new wife and I got married today at the chapel.  Contrary to a lot of the reviews here we had a great time. From the limo pickup,  friendly desk staff,  gentle not pushy up sell,  great minister,  and awesome photographer.  We initially were going to use the gazebo,  but it was pretty warm out so we had it indoors.  The photographer took us out to the gazebo after and took extra photos.   Yes,  the building and it's interior is a little old and well used.   For us that was part of the experience.  If I wanted a 5 star luxury hotel wedding I would have sold a kidney and had one.  We wanted a quiet,  inexpensive elopement that met our expectations completely."
"This is probably my favorite place to get wings in Charlotte.  The big chain stores have okay wings, but this place definitely is unique!  There are a ton of flavors and one of a kind recipes in this place.  \n\nI'd have to agree with everyone else that the place isn't in it for the ambiance.  It's there for the wings!  We also get the cheese fries, which are pretty awesome.  I know they are probably really bad for you, but that means they taste good!\n\nJust wished I lived closer (probably a good thing since I would be here every day eating wings)."
"For what it is (a shop that your wife drags you into on a Saturday to grab a gift), it's awesome.  \n\nIt has all sorts of stuff from home decor to gifts to birthday cards.  All sorts of stuff.  Some is just your basic stuff but some is cool.  Will admit a lot of stuff is overpriced (like a $75 book that was on amazon in the $30s), but for what it is and it's immediate gratification, it's very nice and well run.  For the amount of inventory they have, the space is managed incredibly well and they keep it looking extremely neat."
"Even when I am living out of state I wait to get my haircut for when I am in Las Vegas so that I can go see Brian. \n\nI always feel so wonderful when I leave- my hair looks great, I feel confident, and the best part is that it keeps looking good until I come back. Basically, I never have to go back because the cut has grown out poorly (because that just doesn't happen). \n\nFrom the minute you sit down, Brian is kind and patient as he listens to what you want. He is friendly and professional. I also really appreciate that I never feel rushed- when he is working on your hair, you are the center of his attention.There is usually a great shampoo and head massage before he gets to work. Then, he works his magic.  Before the end, he makes sure that the cut is what you were looking for and is willing to make adjustments, and he doesn't make you feel guilty or awkward about asking. \n\nI have also had my hair dyed and my eyebrows done at Goldilocks and was pleased with the results."
"Grade: B-\n\nIt was good but I was also hungover... Great service, decent prices."
"""During my grad school days Hemingway's Cafe was a staple.  My friends loved ordering the quirky 'buckets of shots' with names like, Lady GaGa and Taylor Swift.  As someone over 30 I couldn't in good conscious order a pitcher of shots (without becoming ill from the insane amount of sugar and alcohol) but no worries, because \""""Hems\"""" always has a great selection of beer on draft.\n\nThe grad school crew favorite was the pita chips and artichoke dip.  Rich, creamy and full of fat.  And delicious.  The I-Need-To-Eat-Healthy version of myself loves the selection of wraps, with the hot honey wrap taking center stage.  Instead of fries I always opt for mashed potatoes.  \n\nThe wait staff here is great and have worked there for many years.  They're friendly and go out of their way to make sure you're enjoying yourself and that your glass is never empty.  \n\nThe atmosphere is pure college.  Small booths and crowded throughways.  So turn your nose down and enjoy it for what it is - a great college bar and restaurant."""
"I've had nothing but the best customer service and advice here.  The store is run by an older queer female couple, and they are extremely helpful, in a non-judgmental (obviously), non-heterosexist, nor presumptive way.  \n\nThe selection of vibrators here is really good (cheap to expensive, simple to highly complicated/advanced), and they are also fully stocked with all other kinds of sex toys (for men, women, couples, and others), sex lit and videos, lube, safe-sex gear (and info) and even lingerie.  I like that they have vegan options for the lube and ones that don't test on animals as well.  Great sex shop."
This was the first time we had ever eaten at a Hooters and it was actually a very pleasant surprise! The food was tasty and the service was good. I loved the shirt I bought at the store but I left it on the monorail which was VERY upsetting. \nI think I'll be back!
Definitely a good breakfast spot. Service was on par and prompt. Nicole (our server) recommended the pancakes. It was a power breakfast. Good cure for my hangover. Coffee was good. Not Starbucks though. I thought the decor was a little dated. But it was clean though. I'd try them again.
This is where I am going from now on to get tires. It was fast cheap and the service was good. Plus they have a great deal on covering your tires. Way better than big o tires
"One of the best Chicken Fried Rice i have found this side of the Pacific!  \n\nWe have been coming to Komol for a long time.  The decor never changed (or that i recognize being different) and everything stays the same.  Fortunately the food is also consistently good through the years.\n\nThis is a must-stop whenever I'm in Vegas.  \n\nThe only problem is that it is a pretty popular place and it could get busy so the food may take a while to get served.  \n\nOtherwise, no complain and highly recommend!"
"My Fiance and I love going to Jojos. We love the atmosphere, it's always clean, the service is good and I really like that they don't act fake, they act like real people. And HOT DAMN THOSE WINGS. No one makes wings like Jojos!! Pizza is also great, way better then those stupid trying to be fancy pizza places that are all over the place now-a-days. I always recommend Jojo's to my friends."
"Great food, great service. Quality is always top notch. What you pay is a little more but it is worth it."
"My family has bought most of our downhill ski equipment here for years. We're always exceptionally pleased with the goods, service and the prices. It feels great to be able to say that I honestly prefer a small local business over their big name competitors."
"DELICIOUS! I'm here nearly every other day (you can tell by looking at my belly) and everyone I've encountered working there has been an absolute doll. Such nice people work there making such tasty good. The coffee is good but not amazing, but that doesn't stop me from getting it daily before work. Make sure you brought cash unless you're buying more than $5 worth though. Five stars!"
The best COOKIES EVER.\n\nI mean that. I am shocked this place only has five other reviews.\n\nEveryone should go here and get themselves some cookies.  The chocolate covered chocolate chip a re delicious.  \n\nThe building is tiny and oddly located but once you go you'll understand why they are still there after such a long time.
"This is a great place to bring visitors from out of town.  The ambiance is most excellent and the food is not too bad.  \n\nI like the lunch menu better than the dinner menu.  Lunch is a bit more affordable and they usually have some interesting specials on the menu. \n\nI'm not much of a beer connoisseur, so I can't review that end.  However, I am surprised that they do not have bigger tv's in the bar area.  I was once there during a Steelers game and could hardly see the screen from the dining room!\n\nThey also have a few good vegetarian options as well, with a more vegetarian friendly lunch menu than dinner."
Delicious. Can't be the pricing on the lunch menu at a sit down restaurant. Great interior decor that doesn't scream Chinese restaurant. So far I've had the House Special Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken. Both were great.
"Awesome organic, natural products! They have a great variety of products considering the store isn't that large. I appreciate the use of local produce, etc. It's all a bit expensive, but that's to be expected."
"Hope that this place never closes, one of the best spots in Charlotte to see live music."
"What better way to spend an afternoon than perusing the wares at Paper Skyscraper? Items range from wildly inappropriate hand soap and tailgating manifestoes to purses, jewelry, candles and greeting cards.\n\nAt Paper Skyscraper, there's something for everyone. It's a one-stop shop for holiday gift-giving. I absolutely LOVE all the Charlotte and NC themed magnets, pins and stickers. Always poignant and funny, they adorn our refrigerator for all our guests to see.\n\nI recently found a charming yellow vegan leather purse that was on clearance. The Mr bought it for me, along with some Moleskine accessories.\n\nIf you've never been, you're really missing out. Paper Skyscraper is...just perfect."
"great place, \n\nthe beauty of the sunshine cafe is..........only the brave or those truly in the know would walk through the shady looking strip mall to get to the front of this place.\n\ni give this four stars and not five because i don't want any more people to come here, there is usually only two or three free booths for breakfast and lunch. so no wait.\n\nthe staff is awesome, the breakfasts are huge, delicious and cheap.  if you want a burger, sammich, or lunch, it's also really good."
Sweet tea was delicious.  Fried Chicken was OK.\n\nThe waffles here are so LEGIT!... barely had to use any syrup as the waffles were so tasty with just the butter and the waffle itself.  The waffles were just milky goodness and it was a sad times when I finished them off.  I kept thinking about the waffles for the rest of my entire trip to PHX. \n\n4/5 :)
"Strong Pre-Game Primanti's Substitue Sandwich!\n\nBeen to Pittsburgh more than a few times, and it was always the tourist trap Primanti's or what has been called the best restaurant in town Nakama Japanese.  This time I went with a suggestion from some other Pittsburghers.\n\nNot that Primanti's or Nakama are bad at all, but it was just time for a change.\n\nEnter: Uncle Sam's Subs.  Been around since the early 70's so you would think they know what they are doing, and they in fact do.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you are not going to be blown away by anything they do here, but you will get a pretty damn good sandwich & fries for under $10.\n\nI went with the cheese steak/mushrooms, and as others have said here, it will not disappoint.\n\nOrder up, sit down, they bring you the sandwich and a side of fries in minutes. \n\nWrap up;\n\nCertainly not a gourmet restaurant, but a real good sandwich real quick for real cheap.  Also a lighter (a lead brick would be lighter) than a Primanti's monster!"
Seriously this place has the best gyro in town. I have tried many Greek restaurants and they may not have a complex flavor but the ingredients are fresh and the flavor is spot on. It's very simple and simple is delicious.
Went here this last Saturday and I have no complaints. It's ALOT better than most chain restaurants like Applebee's and Chili's. Hostess was sweet and our server was attentive and funny. They had a good special on beer which the boyfriend loved. They also had plenty of deals like an entree with an app for 15 and many others that were similar. We ordered the potstickers for the app which were pretty good. Boyfriend got the appetizer sampler for his meal. A plate of meat so and he had complaints. And I got the sirloin medium and it was cooked to perfection. It wasn't packed when we got there around 3pm so I will definitely be coming here instead of attempting to maneuver the CCMills food court.
Great food w/o waiting to long. Can improve on the service. Overall I will come back to this place.
"I always get the chicken tikka masala and it's always delicious.  The staff is pleasant and I haven't had a bad experience.  The price is a bit steep, but it's worth it for the occasional dinner splurge."
Yippee!!!!\n\nTotal Wine now carries the Great Lakes Brewing Co. brand.\n\nI'm not much of a beer drinker but this helps the homesickness a bit.  \n\nTotal Wine has earned a very loyal customer.
"Satisfying fresh drive thru food. \n\nNuff said. \n\nI know a lot of people like In N Out, but I'm going to say it that I have a special spot for Fatburger as the late night choice. I mean a double double animal style is good, but sometimes I just want other options and I like the fries a lot more here. My favorite is the turkey burger  with all toppings or try it with some egg. A plus that burgers come in sizes, sometimes that late I just want a baby burger. \n\nI didn't know there was even one near me until I drove to Big Dog Draft House. Yay! Looks like we have another late night dinner pick up in the NW, we have very few options past 11pm when we have our night owl schedule."
"Stopped by here to get some ice cream but it's not ice cream, it's custard and it's so creamy and rich. We tried all the flavors of the day -- I liked the banana nut and chocolate best. We ended up buying pints of what they have already pre-packaged and got almond chip and malted chocolate. OMG they were both seriously good. The malted chocolate tasted like a Whopper ball. The almond chip tasted like almond tofu with chocolate chips.\n\nCash only and totally worth it!"
"*Great* place.  Went here while visiting Madison (beat the students flooding into the city by just two days).  Food was very well made, authentic-tasting (though, for the record, it's only my second time eating Nepalese food), and very healthy.  Service was at the speed of mom-and-pop shop, not conveyor belt -- that's either good or bad depending on your preference.  Unfrortunately I can't remember the names of the dishes to describe them in detail, but I can say this: mango lasse (South Asian milkshake) made from fresh mangoes.  Y. U. M."
"""Whew...this place is the place to go for your local costume needs. Procrastinating as usual, I found this place to be SERIOUSLY BUSY just 2 days before Halloween. Duhhh right?! \nI was seriously impressed with their Makeup and special effects products...gallons of latex and blood....quality Ben Nye costume make up and accessories. The costume items seem endless. The wigs...the shoes...just about everything a person may need.... \n\nI was also impressed with how friendly and knowledgeable the staff all were considering how busy it was. They have rows dedicated to the more popular requests like Pirates, Demons and Witches. But you can also design your own and look through the \""""story boards\"""" for other costumes that have to either rent or purchase. \n\nThis is the place I will refer friends and family in need of costume or theme party supplies......"""
Top notched BBQ!!  I had the the pulled pork......BOOM!!  This sandwich and the sides rocked.  Next trip I am all over the pulled chicken sandwich.  Oh yeah....... You can get your deer butchered there too.
"Fenwick's Sunday brunch is the shizzzzzz. I dream about it. Not only is the food amazing (and fast!), but the two ladies who always work this shift are the absolute nicest. (And just a smidge sassy! Love it!) The mimosas and bloody marys are MASSIVE. If you're a philistine and not in the mood for breakfast, their burgers are the best I've had in Charlotte. I wish I could move in."
"Since this review I have been back several times and every time was just as exceptional as the first time. I unfortunately moved a bit farther away so I can't go as often, but I can not wait till the next time I can get my hands on some sweet potato ravioli!"
"Very friendly staff, a lot of selections, TONS of infant clothing at a very very reasonable price. Always lots of sales. Recently it's just been reorganized so things are easier to find. Also, they carry older children's clothing, too."
"I know people in Madison like their fair trade and independent coffee houses, but I still love Starbucks. Say what you will, but I love how they make my lattes and cappuccinos.\n\nI really like the people who work at this Starbucks, especially the really nice older lady. (I don't mean any offense by older, it's just that most people at this location are college students.) But anyway, she is so friendly and always recognizes me - which might say something about my coffee habits.... \n\nAnyway, 5 stars."
Heaven is a Baby Fat and an order of their awesome steak fries.
"My favorite favorite way to start the day is a cheese croissant and a coffee at Jean-Marc's.\n\nNever been there? That's a shame, because no matter where you live, you will be happy you made the drive.\n\nSpread the love and take a dozen to share with friends. Enjoy watching their faces when they try one for the first time. You will smile because now they know what you do.  Enjoying his pastries is a pure personal pleasure moment.  \n\nThe return trip is always better because as you get closer to Milvale, your anticipation mounts for the first savory bite. Satisfaction received like nowhere else in town. \n\nEnjoy."
"If you are looking for a great wine shop, that you can also have dinner or share a bottle of wine and feel like you're not in Las Vegas anymore this is the spot.... Hidden in a Strip mall within Desert Shores this place has a deck that sits on the water...cool place for a change of pace..."
"Close to my home and with plenty of parking, this Biaggi's never leaves me hungry. All the Italian food prepared there has been excellent and the menu has plenty of options if you don't know what you want to eat far in advance. Although the prices seem a few bucks more than I'd value each menu item, this is more than made up for by their giant and varied breadbasket. If you're not limiting carbohydrates, it's almost impossible not to save half your entree for later after filling up on bread."
"Noah cut and colored my hair last night on very short notice. I think I love him.\n\nPure excellence, from his warm, welcoming demeanor to his conversational eloquence; he made me feel like he was there FOR ME. Oh yeah, and my hair? Fabulous.\n\nThe best stylists listen to you, then tell you what they think. It's a collaborative effort, and I like someone who has knowledge and opinions and vision.\n\nI usually dread going to spend a couple of hours in a stylist's chair, but with Noah it was a treat."
This is by far the friendliest IHOP I have visited.  The managers are on top of the service. I was trapped in town due to weather and had dinner and breakfast here. Great value and service.
"Ciao! Great selection of Italian treats, sweets, meats, and ...cheese (tried to think of a way to make cheese rhyme). Walking in I felt a bit overwhelmed with the delicious options everywhere! \n\nYou can walk in without a clue to what to make for dinner and leave with an entire meal, plus a bottle of wine. It's perfect for those weeks when you know are going to be killer and you're going to be exhausted...pick up a ready-to-eat meal and just pop it in the oven or grab some fresh pasta!\n\nThe staff were really helpful and friendly! \n\nThe only downfall was the cannoli. Now I know Nicole W. sang praises about this pastry, but I must have gone on a not fresh day. It was small, didn't taste fresh, and pricey for the size & quality. Perhaps my expectations are high since my only experience with cannoli's are from Little Italy in the Boston area where the cannoli's are so big they require two hands to eat them. This cannoli issue can be easily forgiven since the rest of the place was impressive!\n\nGo, explore, and enjoy! Grazie, Pasta & Provisions!"
"Pizza was very authentic and cheap.  Thin crust and just the right amout of toppings.  Make sure to fold it.  The guys who work here were probably the most friendly I've experienced in a NY pizzeria in a long time.  We also had some pasta, but the main event was the pizza."
"Awesome wings!  They're big and meaty, cooked to our specifications of crispy and with a really good spicy/vinegary sauce.\n\nActually I don't think I've ever had a bad meal at Seamus's.  It's not fancy, it's just a bar with a sampling of American and Irish food.\n\nService is always good.  They have a variety of booze and beer from Ireland, as well as crap beer for lame people who would dare step foot in an Irish pub and order something that isn't a Guiness/Harp/Smithwick's.  And I've had many good times at this place over the years."
"Nice upscale mall in trendy South Park, reminiscent of Perimeter Mall in Atlanta but less crowded."
"Amazing breakfast! Stop thinking the now OVERPRICED hotel buffets are best when you are in LV ! Yelpers directed me here and they did not disappoint ! Hubby had the Mile High omelet which he said was full of good ham in between smacks! He also wishes he had got the junior as the regular size was huge! If you have kidsI suggest they split a junior. Petunia omelet is loaded with crisp bacon...take your BP meds people!! The spuds are crispy, more of a good potato chip than a hash brown but quite tasty. Waffle is light and fluffy with warm syrup! Ooooh the BANANA BREAD... Trust any Yelpers who advise you to get this it is warm, full of nuts you must get it there and extra to go for later!!!!\n\nJust Gooo!"
"Love M C Sports!  Great prices, good sales, friendly staff, good product selection.  Did I mention helpful staff?  Sometimes there is low employee coverage but hey if you happen to be there when there is a forcasted slow period you will still get what you want.  M C Sports it is where you go for good prices, friendly staff and great sales."
"Got take out here tonight - very nice people on the phone and in person, prompt service, delicious food.  Tofu was done to perfection and the food was piping hot.  The only reason I only give 4 stars is because I've only had one dish as take out and would need to sample others and check out the service and atmosphere before upping my star rating.  Great, quick dinner."
These are the best pretzels in Pittsburgh.  Period.  It's tough to walk by and not pick up some pretzels to take home.\n\nI recently used them to help cater a holiday party.  a.) It was only $20 for 50 freakin' pretzels.  b.) They had the order ready on-time.  c.) The pretzels were great as left-overs days later.  Win all around.
"This place is touted as having the feel of an authentic British pub, but I've really only experienced the patio area, which is quite nice.\n\nI can't speak to the food, as I was only there to drink and meet a few people, but I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere.\n\nThe service, unlike a few other reviews have stated, was pretty decent. I don't recall waiting an inordinant amount of time for another beer or a time where I felt like I was being ignored.\n\nThe interior seems a bit small, but it had a nice feel to it. There was a duo playing bluesy covers and a few jazz tunes, but the patio is the place for me.\n\nNice place to go if you have a group or just a few friends to catch up with."
Love the comfort food here.  Had the fried chicken special two nights ago and it was fantastic.  Previously I've had their Chicken and dumplings which are to die for.  Deviled eggs come withe entrees but are a little flavorless.  Everything else I've had here rocks\n\nCan't beat the cheap beer on tap either.
"The staff was soooooo nice! I was looking for something specific and inquired with one of the many associates working. She said that they had run out of their inventory, but thought one of the mannequins might have been wearing my size. Sure enough, that mannequin had my pants on:) To make a pleasant shopping experience short, I pretty much bought out the entire store and was extremely happy with my purchases. They are a bit pricey, but the quality of their clothing is worth every penny, plus my new perky butt looks amazing:) !!!"
"I'm no Indian food expert, but this restaurant makes some of the best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh.  My favorite dish so far is the Chicken Saag Wala; reasonably creamy, and very delicious.  The wait staff is pretty friendly, however not the best service in the world.  Go after 10PM and get half off on a large portion of the menu (too bad no lamb dishes).  Watch out, it closes at 11 on weekdays."
"Absolutely the BEST asian buffet I have ever had! It pretty much leaves Krazy Buffet in the dust. Everything was very clean and well organized. The staff was friendly and prompt with the drinks. The lunch price is $8.93, tax included. That is not bad for a buffet that includes seafood, fresh hot and cold sushi, and a custom stir fry bar."
"South Bay Lounge is exactly what I expect of a normal Wisconsin neighborhood tavern, prefect for a casual Friday fish fry. Reasonable prices, decent selection of beers and fish, overall pretty clean and the place has a nice neon glow to it from the signs (inside and out). \n\nThe selection of fish (and shrimp) is much larger than what you'd think - though be warned they do run out and were crossing off fish from the board when we went about 8pm. The fry has crispy/non-greasy. The coleslaw was good, but too much mayonnaise. Looks like they do a lot of takeout, too.\n\nI'm rating four stars, not that it's that special/unique of place, but that it does the midwest neighborhood tavern spot on."
"This place is my favorite bar in all of Lawrenceville. It is not uppity or pretentious at all. It is one of the only old time Lawrenceville bars in the area. \n\nWhen I was unemployed I came to Hambone's ever day to use the free internet, order a cup of tea, and maybe an appetizer. The waitress/waiters were friendly and nice, even though they knew that I wouldn't be ordering much. They even offered tips on where/how to appy. \n\nEverytime someone comes to visit me I try to take them to Hambone's. The atmosphere is just fantastic. Yeah, it might be a little run down, but that is the best part!\n\nDrinks and food are cheap and good! They have live music and comedy nights throughout the week.\n\nStop in, you won't be disappointed."
"I love this spot!! Been there forever, but it's still clean and up to date!! Flat Screen TV even!!! No place nearby w/acceptable Hotdogs/Corn dogs for miles. Glad this one is right down the street :) Those Tastee Freeze's are amazing as well!!! Gotta try one if you haven't!!! \nStaff is pretty friendly as well. I've had a good experience each time there this week..."
"I love this restaurant, it's authentic, it's a no frills, good food deli.  You can't go wrong, every visit I'm greeted with sour pickles and speedy service!  I've only eaten the Reuben because I can't order anything else when I sit down and a big basket of French fries!  Fresh cut potatoes, crispy fried, cooked to perfection and served piled high!  Hell yeah."
"What can you ask for in Dairyland? ICE CREAM. I gained like 15 pounds the first year I got to Madison because I couldn't stop eating ice cream. every day. \n\nSO DELICIOUS! I love how creamy and rich the ice cream are. And the flavors? rich. and sinful. just like how ice cream should be.\n\nWhat to try:\nZanzibar!! Rich dark chocolate, not too bitter, not too sweet. Just right. mm.\nFat Elvis! Banana, chocholate chunks and peanut butter. chocolate chunks are not my favorite. but overall. I love peanut butter and banana. woohoo\nYippee skippee. peanut butter ice cream with brownie, salted caramel, pretzel! love the combination!!! \nHeaps of love - everything sinful that you love. chocolate, brownie, caramel nuts etc etc.\n\nBtw, if you are crunching for a project or school, they came up with a caffeinated ice cream (BANG!). I haven't had the occasion to try it, but it sounds much better than the 5 hour energy drinks.\n\nFeel free to ask to taste the flavors, there are endless choices!! Hint: summer walk down state street, get an ice cream to cool you down!"
"Yes, it's been written below (and more eloquently), but it bears repeating: Vegan Donuts ... in Las Vegas. Yep, you read that right. Just to confirm -- and let this sink in -- Vegan Donuts ... in Las Vegas."
"This is the kind of gem that's off the beaten path and overlooked, but my wife and I had a great meal on the cheap, despite the late hour."
"I have to say, these fish tacos are mighty good.  \n\nI was reading an article in Charlotte's edition of Creative Loafing and the writer mentioned ordering two specific tacos which found to be delightful. Having live most of my life near the coast, I have a rule about eating seafood so far inland. Yet, I've heard nothing but good things about this restaurant and I was literally a block away..so how could I resist?\n\nI ordered a BBQ Mahi taco, which I'm told was featured on 'Diner's, Drive In and Dives.'  The fish wasn't as fresh as it would be at a beachfront taco stand and the sauce was a tad sweet for me, but that was nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix. \n\nI also ordered a Tavaroo Tuna taco, which had a hint of wasabi and was fantastic. \n\nIt was early Saturday night and the dining room was filling up quickly, so I say at the bar and could observe everything coming out of the kitchen..and it all looked delectable.  \n\nNice margarita menu and beer selection too."
"Thai Orchid is a great dinner option in the SouthPark neighborhood. My husband had the Pad Thai and reported that it was the best in town, but not the best ever. I had the red curry. It had a nice slow heat and a good mix of veggies. Portions were of a good size, and the price was fair for the neighborhood.\n\nWhen we visited, the restaurant was busy, but we were serviced in a timely manner. The wait staff were friendly and attentive. The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, but also feels private and not like you are sitting on top of the next table. Oh, and I really liked the wallpaper, which I realize is kind of a strange thing to say about a restaurant."
Went mainly for the colaboration beer for Pitt Beer Week. Sat at the bar and sampled mostly everything. Posted our beer reviews on Untappd. They were all good. Didn't have any food. Love older breweries that keep their history.
"The best animal hospital around! I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else. They are attentive, patient, kind and always accommodating. I can't recommend more highly. If you have a fearful animal this is the place to take them!"
I had a great time at the Rex.  I wasn't sure what to expect from the Rex Theater but I remember growing up on the Southside and my grandma taking me to see movies here when I was very young so I at least knew it would be very theater like.\n\nThere was some awkward construction happening in the rare of the theater what looked to be a newly constructed bar that took away from the scenery a bit.
I would move back to the oppressive heat of Phoenix for some of Seamus' vegetable boxty.  Delicious. \n\nI have loved everything I have ever ordered here.  The french fries are pure perfection.  Everyone is super friendly and they have a great beer and whiskey selection. \n\nThey open early for football games (not the American kind)--or they used to and the company at that hour makes for an interesting time indeed.
"Portofino's is a hidden gem, wedged in a corner of a slightly sketchy strip mall.  The food is fantastic and extremely affordable.  We live down the street and I always forget Portofino's is so close, not anymore!  It was sooo good!\n\n A pasta dish runs about $11 and is a sizable portion.  The bruchetta was good, the tomatoes were a little boring (not enough garlic or spices) but the bread was perfect, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  \n\nThe pink sauce is absolutely freakin' fantastic.  it comes with peas and crunchy prosciutto. It is rich, creamy and has a perfect bite from the parmesan sprinkled on top.  I kept having to smack my boyfriends fork away after I gave him a taste, he kept trying to sneak more, he even kept trying to dunk bread into the sauce!  I am totally hooked on it.  \n\nThe pizza prices are very reasonable, I plan on checking their pizza out next."
"Ever since the remodel, there is hardly a wait except Sundays. Delicious juicy chicken, cheesy mac, and tea so sweet it'll give you diabetes! Yumm"
"I love Asian markets.  First of all the prices are so reasonable.  I go two or three times a year to stock up on certain items.  Coconut milk, soy sauce, Siracha, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, sweet chile sauce and large bags of rice.  If you are ever cooking with these items, it is much cheaper here than the international aisle in your neighborhood grocery.  It is also a great place to buy dishes, if you like cute little plates and bowls, chop sticks and crazy candy.  If you are buying for kids, there is a great selection of candies."
Fantastic food. Charming service.
I was able 2 get right in. No wait! Scott is the best. I was in out within an hour. He really worked with me to make sure I was able to get what I needed taking care of.
"Nikki Lee's is great for lunch if you have a full hour. It's a big sports bar with lots of TV's and tons of cool memorabilia on the walls..in short a typical sports bar. While service can be achingly slow at times (one of my major pet peeves) it's offset by great lunch specials and great food. I've tried everything from their spaghetti to calzones to their garlic bread, and I keep coming back. For lunch this is one of my tried and true fail safe spots. \n\nI've never been here after work, it's always for lunch...I never have time after work but with the larger screen TV's mounted up where you can actually see them, if I could I would."
"Cafe Heidelberg, where do I start? The food was very good. I have lived in Germany for a long time and I can say that the food was very authentic. We had a triple course menu with German potato soup (VERY GOOD), schnitzel baked with ham and Swiss cheese, and dessert ( I ordered the Schwarzwaelder Kirchtorte = Black forest cherry cake and my husband had the Apfelstrudel with Vanilla sauce). The entree came with a side of potato salad and spaetzle. Thinking about the warm potato salad makes my mouth water:)\nService was good. She over spilled my husband's beer... He almost cried lol Beers were imported and brought back some memories. All in all, I think this place is a little too pricey. Ok. the portions are big, but honestly I would rather have smaller portions and pay less for it. I still have my restaurant.com coupon that I couldn't use that day, because they only work on the normal entrees and not the special menu. Might go back, not sure yet..."
I love this store. Its the best in the country. Excellent customer service anytime . great quality stuff becit food or clothes or electronics. Gas prices are a boon. But a tip if you are living close to Ballantyne or within Charlotte get ur gas from south Carolina Walmart...India land. Cheaper than Costco
"Best chain ever.  Aware of their animals, a chain, healthy, easy to go, lemons and chipotle sauce are a nice touch.  Very good staff too, very efficient!"
"I really love this Petsmart. The people who work here are super friendly and helpful. I've taken my dog to the training classes here. The trainer, Natalie, really knows her stuff. She was very helpful. They also have a great selection of tons of great products. Other Petsmarts have been frustrating when I need to get an employee's assistance with things locked away behind glass and things like that. You definitely can't go wrong at this location though."
"One of my favorite Wing places, anywhere. It is small place half bar half eating; paper plates, plastic forks - you get the picture -. They may offer something other than Chicken Wings, Strips and nuggets but I don't know about it other than some of their sides. They have a very good selection of sauces and dry rubs. My favorite is a combination of Lemon Pepper with Smoking Sauce on the side. They do cook to order, meaning that if you like them crispy like I do, you can get it."
"This is THE blues bar to visit in Phoenix.\n\nWild and diverse crowd, amazing blues/jazz bands, and cheap drinks all wrapped up in a traditional dive-bar atmosphere. A dance floor and outdoor patio complete the ensemble. I always have a blast when I visit Char's.\n\nMost weekends the place is totally packed. Parking can be an issue and the neighborhood is not exactly one of the swankiest in Phoenix.."
"I love this restaurant. The food is delicious... And you get so much bang for your buck. Can't have cheese? They'll offer to sub something for it. So gracious and attentive. The hot sauces at the table will knock your socks off, yummy!"
I love it. Why have i never been here.. Waitstaff it attentive.. food was hot spicy and fabulous..
"5 Stars, DUH! its the only place i'll buy my groceries, and the employees rock. Everyone that works there smiles at you says hello and asks if you need help finding anything. I guess they are all so happy because they eat healthy organic food all the time. lol."
"We toured the maternity ward and we were so pleased with this hospital! It was nice to get peace of mind because I delivered both of my previous babies via c-section at a hospital on Hilton Head, SC. The transition to a different hospital was unsettling, until we took the tour. CMC Main is very attractive, clean, highly efficient, hospitable, offers a wide variety of places to eat inside the hospital and in terms of services and care it offers much more than the hospital I had my previous babies at. I'm not worried one bit about the care I'll receive when I give birth soon!"
Excellent sushi and sashimi. Very cozy and be prepared to wait. The wait staff can be quite charming if you prove yourself. Don't be a newb by mixing your wasabi into your soy sauce.
"""Believe it or not, the best thing about Cestone's is their ice cream, which like Darren said, resembles a mousse in taste and texture. It's really thick and holds up well in the heat. The pizza was pretty good. My burger was a little dry, though. The regulars are \""""nebby\"""" as Pittsburghers say but are nice."""
"If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure-shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity."
"Great place and seems to be newly renovated.  It's very clean.  Chicken is crunchy and moist, corn bread is tasty, although waffles could be better (too soft and for me).  Drinks are sweet as they should be.  This place has a real southern feel to it and service is friendly.  They also have a live DJ."
"Great bar and drinks. They know how to make a decent martini. Duck, salmon, and Mediterranean platter were all excellent. This is a little, off-track place that seems to do everything well."
"""If you ever need anything done as far as jewelry or watches, this is the place to go. Well worth the drive from anywhere in Vegas. \nMy fiance is very selective. After visiting many stores both in malls and stand alone locations, Summerlin Jewelers was suggested to us. \nWe arrived, they listened, we selected, they ordered, I bought.\nA week later, I got down on one knee, she said \""""yes,\"""" and now we are getting married.\n  Go there, and this might happen to you as well.\n\nAsk for Melissa, she makes shopping for jewelry a breeze."""
"The burger was really good and the fried pickles were awsome.  Although the wait staff was very friendly, we waited a really long time for our food!  Looked like there were alot of other people waiting too.  If the food had come in a more timely manner I would have said 5 stars."
"Our daughter is a college student at UW and took our 16-year car to be repaired.  This was our first time trying Percy's, and we were so pleased with how fairly-priced, thorough and competent their work was.  Most service stations try to hit us with a long list of other things that could be done (as one expects with an older car) and then pressure us to do more, but that was not the case at all with Percy's. We are very happy that we have found mechanics near campus that we can trust to do excellent work at reasonable prices."
Wonderful!
"For the money you can't beat this place.  Wide selection of seafood, sushi, vegetables, Asian cooked dishes and fruits.  Place is clean, efficient and service is attentive.  I like the steamed fish, kung pao squid, baked mussels, Chinese food and sushi.  Food is salty but tasty.  I go early to any buffet and look for dishes just prepared.  Go hungry."
I'm not sure if it gets any better than this. I absolutely love their staff! When I booked the airport service they were so friendly and professional. I felt very confident that everything was going to be just fine. They even have an app! When we arrived we saw the man with the sign and he grabbed our luggage and off we were! We told him we needed to make a liquor store stop and he sent us to one and we were in and out in less than 5 minutes. We already knew what we wanted. TEQUILA and BEER! He was very friendly and talked to us on the ride. I wish I could request him again but I don't remember his name I just have his picture. The ride going back to the airport was awesome too! The driver helped with bags and she got us there in no time. We didn't have any complaints whatsoever! \nI believe for the service and level of professionalism you can't really beat these prices. The reps are awesome and the drivers are too!
"Simple, tasty, good service, great prices."
"I really like this place for breakfast.  There is almost never a wait for a table, even on Saturday morning.  The food and service is reliable.  There are some healthy options on the menu as well as some very not healthy options (which we all sometimes need and want for breakfast).  One of my close friends introduced me to this restaurant years ago.  As it is downtown, it was awfully out of my way to go again.  But, I always thought of it fondly.  Now, that I am only minutes from downtown - I think I will be getting here more often.  I'm almost glad that there are several poor reviews on yelp because it secures my ability to wander in and get a table whenever I please! :)"
I've been to Jessie and he does really good work I will always go to him when I need work done
I was turned on to the roasting company by a colleague and now I'm addicted.  It's truly as good as it gets.  I always get the quarter chicken and it's better than you'll find almost anywhere.  Apples are wonderful too. Everything is served hot the fresh.\n\nThere's a reason there's always a line and parking can be hard to find...this place has chicken covered!
This place is awesome! Extremely good service. Awesome happy hour prices. Most sushi rolls are 4-9 dollars for 12-2. This place might have gotten me hooked on sushi and I dont think I want to settle for anything less. Only reason Im giving 4 stars is because I ordered some weird sushi. Nothing against the restaurant. I just didnt know what I was ordering. Some of the sushi is served hot and I did not know that from just looking at the menu. Other than that this place is awesome. ALSO! I did not try dessert here but they have tempura ice cream and fried oreos and cheesecake here!!!
"I love this place, I'm not a regular but the few times I've came it's been great!! I only get pedicures and they are very thorough and take their time. I come on Mondays and it's never an issue getting helped right away!! This is the place to go :)"
"Having eaten here about 5 times (3 drive throughs), I must say Memphis does not disappoint. Every single time, I've been happy with what I ordered - chili, ribs, pulled pork sandwich, cole slaw, etc Don't know why there are bad reviews, maybe I just got lucky? It helps that this is right across the wide street from where we work-very convenient. Sorry 'bout the other folks that must've caught it on a bad day. Anyway, now that we're Las Vegans who love meat ;-), Memphis is just fine by us....."
I have had several surgerys here and have always been treated with the best care.  Someone mentioned infection control but I researched this and found out that1 year later they were voted one of the top hospitals!  I always tell me friends to go here!!!
"I love Dilworth Billiards! And I don't even play pool. (or is it shoot pool??)\nRegardless, DB is a great place to hang out.\n\nGo by when Susan is behind the bar for the best homemade Bloody Mary. Ever. Seriously, I didn't even like Bloody Mary's until I had one of hers.\n\nEric, the owner, can usually be found at the end of the bar with his newspaper and a friendly welcome for all his members and soon-to-be members. (To join is a very reasonable yearly rate.)\n\nThis place is private and doesn't have to follow the new no-smoking policy; however, they've been smoke-free long before the local ban went into effect, so the previous poster's info about DB being smokey is outdated.\n\nWhile DB doesn't serve food, they allow you to bring in your own and will cover a pool table if you're having an event there and you bring in catering.\n\nThe nicest surprise of this Dilworth hangout is the outside garden area. It's a great place to hang out with a beer and some friends near the koi pond."
"This IS,,,,,,, the best food in Charlotte. I love this place.  I'm starting to venture out from my normal pizza and tried the meatball sub today. it was great.  now I'm a big guy and can eat but this thing was HUGE, I could only finish half of it. Great Pizza, Great Pasta, Great sandwiches and best of all, this place has a little character.  A great change from the typical fast food, chain, ding ding (Microwave) restaurant that seem to be everywhere in Charlotte."
"They were able to come out same day, actually within a few hours of me calling. Louis was the technician and he was on point. He not only got my ac back in action but he also have me a few pointers on maintenance of the unit. Thanks again Sierra and you will be my go to again."
"Located at South Blvd and Seneca, next to Office Depot, may be the best/quickest alterations joint in all of Charlotte.  (But they are behind locked doors, so ring the bell to be let in instead of jerking at the door handle).\n\nComing in around a busy lunch time to get a pair of jeans hemmed, I was warmly greeted and shown to the dressing rooms.  Once in the pants, I hopped (well, ambled because I am a fatty) up onto the podium and the pants were pinned to the desired length.  I believe is was $10 just to hem, or $15 to have the new hem match the stitching of the jeans.  When I came back just a few days later to pick them up, they were pressed and ready to go.  Upon wearing them, the break was perfect and you couldn't even tell that it wasn't the original hem.\n\nFast, friendly, efficient service with a smile and the pants were exactly what I needed.  Awesome!"
Classy place and great customer service!
"Ten cent wing Thursdays! Not the best wings, but pretty damn good and real cheap!"
"The best turkey sandwich ever my girlfriend says, and a great hot dog and burger also. Doesnt look all that inviting but warm inside. The locals that hang at the bar are very friendly and we actually moved to the bar and hung out after we ate. Burgers are fresh not frozen and grills the dogs. Turkey was deep fried and the sandwich was good!!"
"""Friendly staff, plenty of options behind the bar and decent food for the price. I had the \""""boxty.\"""""""
Great Doctors and very friendly staff!
"The navi sent me on a mini detour but I finally found this place after being recommended by my fellow Yelper Rocky. :)   And I feel very fortunate because this place is a hidden jewel that only the locals know about.  I had never even known frozen custard existed and i'm not even sure if there is another place anywhere that serves frozen custard but if you're in Vegas it's well worth the stop.  I was expecting it to taste like frozen yogurt to be honest but it's not to be confused with froyo! This is definitely NOT froyo!  I had the Western custard which was topped with caramel, fudge and salted pecans.  The custard at first glance appears like yellow froyo but when you taste it, you really taste that egg base and note the smooth quality.  No icy pieces or airiness to this.  Very smooth, dense and tasty!  Even the salted pecans were fresh tasting!  :)~  mmmm!"
"Two words: greasy goodness.\n\nI suppose I should write more, since there is more to say about this little gem called Burger Shoppe.  The Shoppe is in what some would call a sketchy part of town, but that shouldn't stop you from coming by for some good food.  They have an extensive menu that includes great burgers, hot sandwiches and some Mexican dishes thrown in for good measure. I've had their cheeseburger many times and have never been disappointed. And, I've also had their gyro, which is very, very yummy.  And, their fries are fantastic too.  Crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. (Ironically, that is also how I describe myself).\n\nAnother great lunch spot if you work near the Capitol. It can get pretty busy around lunch time, and parking can be a bit horrendous, but it is all worth it in the end."
"I am a local to Las Vegas and recently moved to this part of town.  I kept driving across town to my old salon because I had great service there...however I gave this one a shot and was pleasantly surprised!  They are ALL very friendly, they remember my name, what I like and who I come in with - they also get you all in at the same time (if you come in with a group) and ON TIME!  I know the entire staff by name and love the quality of their work.  \n\nI've had Hannah, Cory and Tina all work on my nails and I love each of them!  I get gels and a pedi about every 2-3 weeks and look forward to it!  They run a timely, courteous and clean salon.\n\nThis place needs more people to know about it (but selfishly I like walking in without an appointment and having a quiet place)!  My friends and I go on the weekend and during our lunch hour - they are amazing!"
"This place is perfection! After going a few times with my boyfriend, I can see how one could crave some chicken and waffles on a Sunday morning.  Don't sleep in too late though because you will wait if you hit the church crowd.  Don't skip the grits!"
"I'm convinced that there is no better food at 2am than this place.  The Chicken Parm remains the best I've ever had.  We always come in with a group of 10 or more and still get great service.  When the sun is up, Charlotte does have some better eateries (but then Charlotte just has the best food in the US), but for 24 hour dining...this place is the king."
"One of the most beautiful places I've ever stayed at. The price is about what you would expect for a huge room with a jacuzzi ($183 for premium room). Service was friendly but it's not a big chain so don't expect 24 hour service. Heart shaped jacuzzi was perfect for a romantic experience. There is a train close by but not a major intrusion. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for a romantic getaway. Just a piece of history I will revisit again and again."
"You can't go wrong with a place that serves coffee and alchohol.   I mean you can can start and end your day here.  What's there not to like?   The staff is alway pleasant, the crowd is diverse, and the pastries are pretty decent.  I come here to study sometimes and to steal wifi when I need to focus.  I can stay here for hours and get lost in my own world here.  \n\nI was here last night and it also appears that they have wine tastings.  Didn't inquire about it but it is def on my to do list.  They also have a magnificent selection of tea, at least I think so, based on my limited knowledge of tea.  \n\nThis place has become a staple in my life and I'm never disappointed with the service or products offering.  Keep up the great work Barriques!"
"Absolutely superb!  I made a 10AM appointment, showed up 15 minutes early and got taken in immediately.  Within 5 minutes, I was told I did not need need front brakes, but did need rear.  Believe it or not, my car way ready to go by 10:20AM.  I've had oil changes that took longer!  The brakes came with a full replacement guarantee if there was any problem.  The price was about one half that of the quote I received from the Lexus dealer!!!  I'd give Mr. Brake  6 stars if I could!!!"
"Love Chaya!  \n\nThey recently moved, so they now have a lot more room.  So if you have to wait for a table, it won't be nearly as long as it used to be.\n\nSushi is always fresh, tasty and very decently priced.  Rolls are a perfect size and the nigiri is a generous cut.  \n\nI have yet to have any of the other options (other than sushi) but from the reviews I have heard, they are excellent as well."
If you need VW parts u found the right place...Friendly Folks and i enjoy buying coming here and buying parts..
"""This place is pretty cool I must say. They have so many wacky nick knacks all over alone. Just looking around I know where a my \""""fun and joke\"""" gifts will come from. The atmosphere is eccentric and the staff is pretty nice. \n\nthey also have food especially for the vegan types. I am not a vegan, however I do love the food from time to time. My favorite are the breakfast sandwiches. The selection of beer and win is really good. \n\nThis is also a little hangout spot with a back patio. I usually visit here early in the morning. Parking is not great, but not many places in that area are. I would recommend stopping in here at least once, especially in the morning for the breakfast."""
"Went for dinner tonight and it was nice to go on a night when there isn't a million people there.  Party of 6, we were sat right away and greeted by our server.  I had the grilled choice of 2 with flounder and grilled jumbo shrimp.  For $13.95 this is hands down one of the best values in town for seafood.  3 large fillets of nicely seasoned fish and like 8 or 9 grilled jumbo shrimp which was perfectly cooked and seasoned well.  Baked Potato, salad and some of the best hushpuppies around.  Here's my thing, I don't like regular hushpuppies because their mostly overly fried and bland.  Captain Steve's are fried, but they have a hint of onion in their mix which makes them delectable.\n\nThis is truly one of the hidden gems of this area and should not be missed."
Was there during my visit in October and man was it good.  I usually get the Carne Asade burrito.  I forgot how good it was.  As soon as I finished it I wanted to go and get another one.   And having the drive thru makes this place a breeze.  Can't wait to be back in AZ to stop at this place.
"This is one of my favorite Walmart's by far. It is always clean and well stocked. The staff are amazing, very helpful and very friendly. Carol the door greeter is such a sweetheart! The produce and dairy departments rock. Oh yea the bakery/deli crew is pretty to too. Overall Id say all the department's hold it down! I will say on the down side it does get really busy. Expect long lines on weekends."
"My friends and I were actually trying to go to another restaurant down the street for lupper (lunch/supper), but it was closed. I'm so glad, because Bangkok Balcony is great!\n\nWhat I really like is the ambiance. It feels classy and authentic, with red and gold accents all around, Thai paintings... We got a great table near the windows overlooking the street. The service was also really good.\n\nThe food was ok. I got the shrimp pad thai, which is kind of what I get at every Thai restaurant. It tasted pretty typical. Maybe a little pricey for what the food is like, but it seemed like they had a better lunch deal that we missed. I'd totally go back to check out their lunch."
Second to none! Great company!
"Guys and gals, most Hampton Inns are going to give you a good room, good bed to sleep in, no thrills, but solid rooms. This location does not disappoint. They do have a bar and some slots in the main lobby area. Solid location, just about 0.3 miles from the Tropicana/MGM Grand/NYNY corner of the strip. If you are using a cab probably $5 bucks and across from the hotel is an in and out burger (which is awesome too). \n\nThis hotel does provide a shuttle to/from the airport to the hotel. Again, very solid. \n\nEnjoy!"
I love Dr. Drake and Carolann. You get small town service and care. He truly loves animals and Carolann is so helpful and sweet. I can't say enough about how much Percy and I love this vet.
"I use Presidential every time i go to Las Vegas & I have yet to have anything but great experiences.  Their drivers are on time, friendly & the vehicles are all clean and well maintained.  The pick-up email reminder is great, especially in Vegas when you can forget a whole lot more than what time your driver is coming the next morning :)\n\nI always book the round trip SUV service & have the driver stop at a liquor store on the way to the hotel so i can buy a few bottles of champagne & beer.  I have never had a driver complain about stopping, they are always great.  Sometimes on the way back to the airport we get them to go through the Inn&Out Burger drive-thru since we don't have Inn&Out in Canada & love it so much.  Once again, no issues from the driver, especially if we buy him lunch :p\n\nAll in all, a great company that I would recommend to anyone looking for a reliable transport service in Vegas!"
Went in to get fingerprinted for a job and discovered that they can offer most of the same services that FedEx does.  They are not a true copy center but it is pretty close and I was impressed by their customer service.  For simple stuff going here will be much more convenient that driving to a FedEx store.
I love Nikkos!!! Been going here since it was in the small venue across the parking lot!  This place by FAR has the best sushi!  The chefs are amazing and the owner Joanna is always there ready to keep the energy lively.  If you want cheap smelly raw fish then please go elsewhere.  You get what you pay for here! SUSHI LOVE!
"""carne asada taco is the item to get here! make sure to order it \""""con todo\"""" with everything. taco de pollo is a close second."""
"Basically, if you are downtown and want cheap and delicious food check out Med Cafe. They are the absolute BEST Mediterranean food you can find in Madison. Anyone I've brought to Med Cafe have LOVED it. The salad is great. The rice is great. The main dishes are great. The arabic tea is great. I love basically everything about Med Cafe. I worked there for a few months and the owners are all REALLY good to their employees. Everyone is super nice. And I can tell you as someone who worked there that their ingredients are really good. Everything is made from scratch. \n\nI heard they aren't open for dinner anymore. Which is too bad."
"Decent place. The Beef Wellington was flawless. The drinks were well done as was the ribeye. The flaming desserts (Bananas Foster) were tasty and the presentation makes for good theater. The bar looks like a great singles spot for the over-40 crowd. Unfortunately, eating at night means you'll miss the great lake view. The ambience is a little off--the wallpaper is faded and water-damaged in spots, but still a nice place."
"""I love going here for some good southern soul food.  It is set up like a traditional cafeteria, where you walk down a line and order each item individually.  I always order entirely too much by the end of the line, but I find somewhere to tuck it in my little belly.  The line cooks here are all sweethearts.  \""""What can I get for ya honey?\"""" or maybe, \""""You need to get a little more, you're a growing boy!\""""  Well, I am twenty three, but I still get a kick out of it.  I wish all of these ladies where my grandmother.  Killer mac and cheese here, the key lime pie is nice too.  The crowd is mostly older, but it is an all around wholesome down-south experience."""
"A good solid steakhouse.  Not the best, but it has a lot going for it.  The waitstaff was good, the view was good, and the setting was different.  The salads were made w/ fresh greens,etc.,the dressing was excellent, and the steak tender.  The only drawback to the steak is that it could have had more flavor; on the other hand, my partner said her steak had good flavor.  Go figure.\n\nThe dessert was outstanding."
"Colleens is one of the best places to buy Furniture in Vegas. They have items that are gently used and some from the market center. The prices are fantastic. For around 600 we got a sofa, a Lazy boy sleeper sofa! a club chair, and a nice bookshelf all delivered. The staff are friendly and helpful. Best time to go is last weekend in the month, when the have their red line clearance."
"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised when I met up some friends here. And I've been back several more times since.  This isn't some dirty little bar, as though it may provoke you to think that.  The food is GREAT!!  Big portions, easy on the wallet, I would totally recommend this place for late night eating."
"Beautiful inside.  Great food.  Great atmosphere and I have to say this over and over and over again.  THIS IS NOT A CHAIN!!!!\nNext time you are out and you need to entertain for business, rethink the corporate usuals and give this place a go.  \n\nWell worth the short trip out of uptown."
"Great store, with good deals on stuff you probably buy anyway. It's busy there on Saturday morning & Sunday afternoon, the best time to show up is 2 p.m. on Saturday or early Sunday (they open at 10 a.m.). Even with this strategy, you may still find there is a line to check out. \n\nThis is possibly the best place to buy certain types of gourmet foods like cheese, wine, olive oil, etc. I like their meats and organic produce much better than Trader Joes, but you have to be prepared to eat a lot of the same thing for a few days. I would stay away from their bakery area. Nothing of quality and everything with transfats."
"My husband and I have been here a few times and have yet to have a bad experience! The staff is friendly and attentive but aren't intrusive or bothersome.  Prices and portions are reasonable.  The food is delicious!  I am not a spicey food person so Cajun food is generally out of the question for me, but I have to say I really like this place! On our most recent trip I got the chicken cordon bleu with a side of mashed potatoes -- highly recommend!  My husband has tried the gumbo and etouffee and loved both.  Give the Cajun yard dog a try you won't be disappointed!"
"La Cucina is a cute, small Italian restaurant in Squirrel Hill. From the outside, it looks a little rundown, but the inside is fine, though the tables are close together. \n\nI called beforehand, and they don't take reservations on the weekend, but the man who answered the phone suggested coming before 7 or after 8:30 p.m. \n\nThe restaurant is a short drive from the University of Pittsburgh, and Squirrel Hill is a very interesting Jewish neighborhood with a great variety of restaurants and shops. \n\nThe food here was really good. It took awhile for me to decide what I wanted, because there are a lot of choices. No pizza though. I ended up getting a chicken/red sauce dish and my dining partner got regular pasta because he's vegan. The service was good, our waiter was very attentive. The soup of the day was ridiculously good -- it was some sort of pumpkin mix. Dinner for two was about $60."
"OK so it's a dive...that happens to have live bands playing, and I was there for Jungle Rot and Immolation!\nBeer prices are very fair,even on weekends, but don't expect premium drafts. They have a few of those available in bottles,but seeing as how I'm watching my weight, I settled for a $4 Miller lite!\nHad a great time at the show, as I always do. Never tried their daily drink specials, but I have bought pitchers here. Again, fair prices.\nHere's my favorite part: it's close to Savers! I can go thrift store shopping then go get a drink and watch a show,love!"
"My favorite restaurant EVER! I no longer live in Madison but every time I visit, I make sure that I stop here. The food is too-di- for, the service is always friendly and-- espeicially after their remodel in the last year--the atmosphere is classy but casual. I really can't say enough goo things about this place. Try it, you won't regret it!"
"""Really enjoyed shopping here. Nice selections throughout most of the store. I was surprised that the coffee section didn't have more variety and better assortment of local roasters or very well respected roasters. Saw some Kickapoo and \""""Just Coffee\"""", but not a lot of others. \nFair amount of gluten free and vegan products. \nOverall, a nice store. \nThe best Co-op EVER is in San Francisco. Rainbow Grocery.\nSo, I cannot give 5 stars. Just can't."""
"The smoothies are incredible. They make them from fresh squeezed juice and fruit as you order them. The pastries are good too - not quite as standout as the smoothies, but still tasty.\n\nIt can get crowded sometimes, but they have a fair amount of seating, so it isn't something they could easily fix."
"""I went here after a recommendation from a friend and I was not let down. I have never eaten any Ethiopian food before, but it was pretty good. \n\nThe atmosphere was very nice. It was quiet, not too busy (but also not dead), a little dim and we got a somewhat secluded table. It was very nice for a date. \n\nThe food was pretty good. I wasn't too impressed, it seemed a little bland, but then again, I did pick the most basic \""""meat and potatoes\"""" dish. My girlfriend had some sort of yellow curry. She liked it. I think I tried it and it was pretty good, but I am not a huge fan of curry. \n\nThe drink selection looked pretty large. They had a full bar. Looks like a fun place to share some meals with some people and have a couple of drinks.\n\nThe decor was pretty nice, bathrooms clean. Overall it was a good place and I will probably check it out again sometime. Maybe I will be a little more bold with my food choice this time."""
"What more is there to say that hasn't been said already?  I come here almost every time I visit Vegas.  Omelets are made with half a dozen eggs and they're awesome.  And of course, absolutely order the banana bread.  I honestly think it's the best banana bread I've ever had.  On the other hand I finally tried the pumpkin bread and it's just a much tamer version of the previous.  So skip out on this."
"Asian buffets are a guilty pleasure of mine. Cheap, pretty tasty and all you can eat. It can't get much better than that. This place gets pretty busy and they still maintain pretty good service and keep the food stations clean."
"First of all, yes this is the Costco Business Center. No food court, no booze, but if you are going here on purpose you know how great it is. It's like Costco plus for proteins and vegetables. They have a much larger selection of veggies and herbs (also in larger packages) than regular Costco and also more larger cuts of meat and case beef and poultry.\n\nI also now shop here exclusively for my kitchen supplies. They have a wonderful seleciton of all kitchen gadgets, knives, plates, pots & pans, and every sort of professional catering/serving vessel you might need including plastic serving and to-go stuff. They also carry very reasonably priced chef coats and pants.\n\nAnother reason to stop by here is that they have a large selection of bulk individually packaged items (think convienience store items). This stuff could be very useful for travelling, camping, or any other single use situation.\n\n**You can go with any level of Costco membership, not just Buisness**"
"This place rocks, I have used them more than a dozen times. Everyone is down to earth and excited to help you. From the owner to bottom they are amazing"
"I just switched my daughters pediatrician and decided to take her to Matthews Children's clinic.  I picked Dr. Musgrave and honestly because she's about my age. I wanted someone more modern and up to date for my child.  I picked a great Doctor for her, she was very nice and on point with her visit.  She was very thorough and let me know everything I needed to know and do for my child. I was really impressed by everything at this doctors office. She will be going back for many years to come."
"Bountiful plate for chicken and waffles. You could even change it up and replace with other side dishes. Turned out wonderfully and delicious. Staff was quite attentive as well. The location isn't great, however, but it will have to do."
"After years of passing by this place we finally decided to stop and try it, and i'm glad to say it did not let us down. The chicken wings and ribs were delicious and freshly grilled. The mac&cheese was good but the mash potatoes were salty, the corn is out of a can but i don't care since i didn't go for the corn. The cucumber salad is really good too. The place was very clean and has good customer service. All in all we will be back soon.  loved the outdoor seating!"
This place was great.  Their seafood enchiladas were amazing! And that pomegranate margarita was great. Aaron was our waiter. He didn't want me to use my Groupon at first.  Yea right! I found this place driving and found a deal. Now i have to find a place in LA for a replica of those enchiladas!
"This place was pretty chill. A bunch of us went on a weekday night to just hang out and relax. We played pool and had some drinks (none of us ate, though i want to return and try their food). Our server was very nice and speedy, the bartender I first interacted with upon arriving there was a little rude, but, nothing that obnoxious. Drinks were well priced and were decent in strength. Great selection of draft beers."
"Great coffee, laid back atmosphere.  Lots of seating.  Quiet.  It's an almost perfect coffeeshop.  (Only thing that would make it better on my list would be if it was just a little more hippie and counterculture... but that's just me.)\n\nThey have a large collection of travel and stainless coffee mugs.  \n\nIf I lived in Madison this would definitely be one of my hangouts."
"Great place to get a burger. Double butter burger is my favorite, but this particular Culver's seems to have the best pork tenderloin sandwich. The staff is always nice of course. I'm not an ice cream person but I would occasionally enjoy their turtle. Why would you ever want to go to Mcdonalds or other fastfood places if you have Culver's?"
Best burgers bachi burger sucks compaired to the big dogs
"Very tasty chicken and waffles. Make sure to go when they are busy so you get hot and freshly fried chicken.\n\nTheir portions are huge! The first time I went I ordered the KK's, and it was way more than I could handle. The second time around I got the Lo-Lo's and still was barely able to finish it.\n\nAll the drinks are served in mason jars.\n\nThe staff were all very courteous and friendly, I felt very welcomed."
"I was blown away today by the kindness, friendliness and honesty of the crew at Capitol Tire and repair.  Was able to easily set an appointment over the phone and when I took the tires in, Sean was quick, helpful and completely up front about a inexpensive problem that could have been passed of as an expensive replacement.  We'll definitely be back for all our auto needs in the future!!!"
"Everything is good, and the dudes that work here are cool."
"Called places to get my battle axe laser engraved on especially a difficult item such as an axe, that I won for placing in the Jay cutler desert classic! Didn't take much time at all! THe owner Steven was very nice. Def will be back to in case and engrave all of my basketball memorabilia!"
"I stay at quite few Hampton Inns, but this one is unique. The proximity to the St Joseph's hospital lends this property to be used by many family of patients, and the staff is beyond nice, but rather super accommodating and compassionate. speaking to the front desk they offered the best and most reasonable rates for the week we stayed, better than anything online. everything in the hotel was clean and functioning and the breakfast area was stocked and pristine. Fresh coffee at all hours, and I really needed that. Our room keeper really took care of our mess, and every day. the room was fresh as new.\nThere are no words that can express the gratitude for the extra steps they took to help my family during our darkest moments. truly a stellar staff, with hearts as big as the valley."
"Excellent selection of eccentric gifts and unnecessary personal indulgences, from Lotta Jansdotter stationary to Small Things Designs silver jewelry to the odd light-up piglet keychain."
"Anyone who remembers as far back as my age would announce, knows that ice cream parlors are hard to come by. This one dates back to the 50's in a GREAT WAY. It's exactly what you would want in an ice cream shop. Even the waitresses appear to be a throwback to a time before they were even born (young girls wearing poodle skirts). I loved my time here and the ice cream is probably as great as the day they opened. You  can even order the option of one that serves the whole table. And why not have a party here as well? \nMy hot fudge sundae was glorious and next time I might have to go with the larger size."
"i had the mushroom ravioli for dinner and i thought i died and went to heaven. the best part though was not the dinner....it was the service. my waitress mary kate was one of the most wonderful people ive ever encountered. thank you mary kate, for being an amazing individual."
"""I am quite aware that this is a chain Meican eatery, but I cannot get enough of it.  I'm a traditionalist and always order the crispy beef taco's with refried and rice.  The quality is there, the consistancy is there and always, the service is there.  If your lucky, a guy named \""""Philly\"""" will deliver your food.  He is straight outta Mexico and for sure one of the happiest guys ever!  \n\nBonus: the fresh chips and salsa are free (regular salsa and hot, I like to mix) and the white queso dip is spot on."""
"Mmmm. They have the most amazing pizza here. And it's not that expensive. The sauce or crust must be loaded with garlic butter, because it is fantastic, yet light at the same time. I say go for it, get a pizza that's loaded, because you won't regret it!"
"""If you are looking for an authentic Italian Deli and restaurant than look no further. If you are an east coast Italian and wondering where to find a \""""real\"""" deli than this is the place. I rarely eat Italian food in restaurants, but I'll eat here any day. Magnifico!!!"""
"YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!\nI'm not even from Vegas and I heard about Capriotti's since it's famous amoung the locals. Now I can see (and taste) why! I loved LOVED my mushroom cheesesteak with grilled onions and peppers! Soooo freakin' good! \nI just wish they had one here in the Bay Area, specifically somewhere across the street from my job....\nDamn I'm craving Capriotti's right now as I write this review!"
This Walgreens is awesome all because of their customer service. Friendly associates. I was looking for a specific item. An associate was readily available offering assistance before I even asked and led me right to the item and even gave her opinions of it. I like this place.
"The pizza here isn't really NY style or Chicago style, its just pizza, but it's delicious.  I went here for dinner and some drinks with my best friend.  I was overwhelmed by how scrumptious the cheese pizza was; it was loaded with cheese and tangy sauce and it wasn't greasy like most of the restaurants that serve pizza around here.  \n\nThe bar is smoke free and even though I do smoke, I thought this was a refreshing change.  The owner Mr. Fechellio came out to check on us during our meal, and shot a few jokes our way.  It is a family place, and Fecellio's family all have jobs here.  Great Italian dining experience overall."
"I have heard about this place for awhile but we have never  made it to it until this past week. I have to say they have some of the best wings I have ever had. I did the southwest and they were great, Wife got Medium and great also.\n\nThe onion rings was also good with a hint of Old Bay, but very good. \n\nOur daughter got a burger and I had heard they had great burgers so i took a bite and it had great flavor and might have to try that the next time around. \n\nCheck it out great food, and good people watching also."
This review was posted in error and I don't know how to delete it so I am just changing the star rating to five but I have no experience with the shop
"Super good food.  Owner has so much passion, top quality fish.  It's super busy on Xmas night.  Owner came around and gave us more sake on the house because we had to wait.  Great and friendly staff.  Wish we made reservations on the sushi bar for more interaction."
"Corn Beef & Pastrami with fries were gooooood good.\n\nThey serve Green River soda. This place knows what's up.\n\nI'm not much of a deserts guy, but you have to get their banana split. Huge serving. Great vanilla taste."
"One of my favorites anywhere. Warm, kitchy and inviting.  The food is absolutely awesome. Do yourself a favor however and resist the temptation to order the Jerk ... that you have had at any other Jamaican place and get one of the Rundown items. Unique to here and AMAZING!"
"WOW! The wife ordered the chicken and black bean combo con queso and I got the sante fe chili and rice. We also ordered and split 10 hot wings. The chicken and black bean combo con queso is boneless, skinless rotisserie chicken served over our herb rice and topped with queso which I have to say after tasting it my wife threatened to stab me with her fork if I tried to get anymore. The sante fe chili and rice was homemade beef chili served over rice and topped with our queso sauce. Man this stuff was stick to your ribs goodness. The wings were the type we loved which had a crispness to them and the sauce was divine. They have other sauces there to try which are also very yummy. We had a wonderful time there and will most definitely be back."
Service was good and food was good too.
Great food and wonderful staff. A lot of places you go in and you get greeted by a grumpy old person. Everyone here was happy and jolly. It puts you in a great mood to enjoy their delicious pho. If you're looking for a good pho restaurant to go to. You def gotta check these guys out!
Got a reliable set of new tires with a rebate and service plan and they finished the job just like they said in 45 minutes.  Will definitely go back!
"Original Lo Lo's....This really has to be the easiest review I have ever done. The service is great and very personable. Everyone asked us if we needed a refill or needed help (not just our waitress).. GREAT SERVICE!!! They really make you feel at home and have stayed grounded even though EVERYONE wants them to become a major chain. 5 stars. And did I mention how Great the food is. I really need to start trying other things but the chicken and waffles are to GOOD to turn down. If you have not had Lo Lo's, get there soon. Definitely at the top of my Yelp list.."
Not the best Octopuss in town (that would be Park Street)... But these guys get you in/out quickly. Not very good detail work at this location
"Hands-down the best burrito in town. None of the big chains compare to the freshly grilled chicken and steak, toasted (not steamed) tortillas and moist, sticky (not dry) rice. Everything about the flavors are perfect.\n\nFresh salsas, made on-site are the finishing touch. \n\nI've been eating at Phat Burrito almost every week since they opened, years ago. Consistently better than all the other chains.\n\nWe are so lucky to have this landmark right here in Southend."
"We stayed at a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom unit for 10 days while waiting for a house on base. Really spacious and the beds were very comfortable. The grounds were well taken care of. My 3 year old enjoyed the pool and the water park every day. We also used the grill by the pool quite often. Our kitchen was absolutely perfect with new Cuisinart stuff and high quality cookware/dishware. Having a washer & dryer inside our unit was a huge plus as well. \n\nI was also prepared to have the timeshare tactics talk but there was none of that whatsoever. \n\nOne thing you must know is that they do not offer free Internet in the room. Wi-fi is available through a third party company but it was something like $7/day or $30/wk. You can always use the 2 computers in their business center though. \n\nFor the price we paid (booked through Expedia), it cannot be beat for its location & amenities. It's perfect for groups/families looking for space, convenience, and value."
"Two things are just awesome here, the omelettes and the german pancakes.  I orginally tried this place at Green Valley Ranch but the wait there can be long.  This location is off the strip and much quicker.  I was fascinated by the german pancake concept, powdered sugar, lemon and berries, Wow unreal and delicious.\nThe vegetarian omelette is so incredibly good with gouda cheese, I just get a side of bacon to go along with it.  Their bacon is also very good.  I have been to many different ones from the Los Angeles area to Fremont, CA.  I like this location the best, not everyone has gouda cheese.  No matter how strange it looks try the german pancake, its like a yolky crepe texture but so wonderful.  I can't wait to be back in Vegas just for this breakfast!"
"If you're looking for a good time..Charlies just may be the place for you.  It's always packed on Friday and Saturdays. I would recommend Saturday , as being the busiest.  If your any type of an extrovert, you're almost guaranteed to meet a guy.  Be careful though, they pour heavy drinks and the beer flows like the Colorado River here....so don't beer goggle.  The line dancing is fun to watch and definitely is a conversation starter.  Go the the back part of the bar for the volleyball court...always fun to chat out there.  All types of guys go here...you're bound to see a wide variety of guys.  Very friendly bar.  Oh yea, they play more than country music too.  This is not a hick bar as many out of towners may think."
"I've loved this place for years.  It's typical of chop suey houses in other major cities; authentic, perhaps short on style but absolutely outstanding food.  Great people."
I always get the Philly Cheesesteak with just meat and cheese. I have never been disappointed!
"Been here before for late night munching.  Finally came with my out-of-town family for Dim Sum on Thursday for lunch.  It was surprisingly crowded. \n\nExcellent dim sum offering.  They offered many types of dumplings, as well as roasted meats, steamed vegetables, and mini stirfried plates.  The carts came every few minutes.  I will say it was a bit overwhelmed at one point, but I appreciate they were frequent and had an abundance of offerings. They even offered my beloved roast duck on one cart... I was about to order it off the menu.  The only negative was that we asked for water as we sat for lunch but didn't get it until we asked for the 3rd time, which was almost at the end of our meal.  \n\n5 people and less than $80 bucks including the $12 tip... so much food, so good, so cheap, and so impressive to guest!  Great way to show off the unique food offerings in Vegas."
"We waited for a bit o be seated and it was just us two (bf and I) waiting... but we were acknowedge by a waitress. He got the rio grande (I think that's the name), its #21 and I got the stuffed blueberry french toast. Delicoius!"
Ol Rawhide dip shit...is full of sht! So what ever the dumb fkr has to say is also full of sht! He can't get from la to vegas since triple d was over and make his dumb asz remark...no way any way!!! just some fkn green freak!
"Husband had surgery. From the quick admissions to discharge, we were very pleased. Kudos to the staff on floor 4. His nurses Tony and Rachel were attentive and efficient. The rest of the RN's should take lessons from them . Also great was Lillian in housekeeping. All above not only took care of my husband but also helped me out when needed (tried not to ask for much) hope we do not need their services again :)"
"""This is the common cure  for your average las vegas Bar. (Yes is stole that from Mad Men).  Let's start with the fact that they have a micro brewery there!!!  It is kinda of the closest thing we have a for a real locals tradition sorta thing.  \n\nWhat I love about this place is the Breakfast!  They have a different menu with some one of a kind items - atleast stuff you wont see on every other menu in Vegas.\n\nI had the \""""Bucky Breakfast!\""""  Bratwurst, eggs, homefries, toast... and a spicy bloody mary.  The sausage was very tasty - what a way to start off the day.  I ordered \""""basted\"""" eggs.  Most of the time restaurants don't baste them right, but I always order basted anyway.  This place basted my eggs as good as my mom does!!!!!  \n\nI would give it 5 stars but too much Packer memoribilia!!!  JK."""
"By far the best ER experience I have ever had. The staff were ( for the most part) very friendly, responsible, an knowledgeable. They let me know what to expect and how long I could expect to be there. \nIn an area where consumers have a choice on where to receive services, Carle has set the bar high."
"You won't find a more knowledgable, friendly staff around. This place constantly has great discounts, even during the ski season. A lot of people are confused that this doubles as a tennis shop, but trust me, these guys know how to string a racket. Talk to Sam or Jeff, they will go to the end of the world to help you get a great fit in a boot, get your skis tuned, and cater to your vacation. Speaking of boots, if you need your ski boot to fit like a glove, this is the place to go. Again, talk to Sam, he is the resident expert in all things boots. Great brands too, and this is a family owned business, support local!"
"Stopped in for a snack today. I have been dining at Sushi 101 for about 10 years and love it. The place was empty but it was an unusual time of day, 3pm on a Sunday. The Host was very nice. I always love when I am greeted with a smile. I chose to sit at the sushi bar. The Host took my drink order and food order promptly. I had the Squid Salad and Spider Roll. The salad was perfect but the roll was a little disappointing. The middle pieces of the roll had no Spider, ie. Soft Shell Crab, bummer! Definitely not the norm for Sushi 101. \n\nThe Host and the Waitress came over several times to check on me. Yeah I know they were probably bored but it still made me feel semi special.\n\nAs I was leaving the Kitchen staff AND the Host bid me a fond farewell. Seriously, a girl can get use to that kind of attention."
"I had never been to Tyber Creek before, despite the number of times I have passed it driving through South End.  I was very impressed on my first visit and well certainly be back.\n\nI love the atmosphere of a pub (opposed to a bar).  The dark wood everywhere and the focus on good beer and good friends (instead of trying to be a restaurant/dance hall/bar).  Upstairs is more seating and another full bar with drafts, bottles, and spirits. They do food as well, but did not sample any on my first visit.  It seems like they take a stab at being Irish, with Guinness and a few other Irish staples on draft, but only a few selections on the menu.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the music can be a little on the loud side.  But, at least they play DECENT music, something that fits with the atmosphere and the menu.\n\nFun hangout place that I'll certainly return to."
"""3.75 stars\n\nI love Vietnamese food and I can be picky since I know what good homemade Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like. I usually manage my expectations when I'm outside of areas that could be called \""""little saigon.\""""\n\nCame here when I was visiting my friend in Charlotte. The pho was pretty good. I was also intrigued by the idea of a AYCE vietnamese buffet. So of course, we had to come back and partake of it. \n\nI was impressed by the variety of Vietnamese dishes and soups. It was nice to see more than just pho. Don't get me wrong, I love pho, but it's great for people to see that there's more to viet cuisine than that one dish. Everything tasted pretty close to authentic. Also a number of central dishes (mmm, bun bo hue!)\n\nGood viet food at decent prices. I'm a fan!"""
"This is a very good diner. I've eaten here several times, and this time Holly was my waitress...she'd been working there for about a year but I've never run into her before. She's pretty good, tried hard, very nice. The food is pretty good, pretty fast, pretty reasonably priced. Great place for groups, very accomodating and convenient. Aside from the homeless beggar outside the door working the crowd, I'd have rated this place 5 stars on the coffee alone (YOWZA! That's good coffee!)."
"I love breakfast, and First Watch does it right.  I had a hard time deciding because there were so many healthy options, along side heartier food.  Service was good.  I'll be back!"
"I popped into the drive-thru for lunch one day when I was short on time. This is the perfect place when you're in a hurry! \n\nThe drive-thru was totally full, but it took me less than 5 minutes to get through it with my food. The employees were all polite, but businesslike. \n\nWhile I don't resort to fast food often, I'll be back here next time the situation calls for it!"
"Pretty run of the mill mom & pop shop, roast pork & bbq pork is sold at $9 a lb. and what can I say the bbq is pretty on par with what I can get in Boston both crispy and flavorful respectfully. Great to know I can find some comfort food in Charlotte."
Suki suki now!\n\nThis is some damn good food.  Best fried chicken in my life.  Tha Mac and cheese was ok...not special but good.  The service was awesome!  The servers were literally hugging us as we left.  \n\nAbout $15 a person...not cheap but worth it.
"Fantastic setting.  Wonderful service.  Good food - but not great.\n\nI've been here three times now, and the place is consistent.  It's a very satisfying place to be - great setting (albeit a bit loud due to the beer brewing setup), great people.  Good food (not divine but definitely tasty!) and the beer is pretty good quality - a tad watery.\n\nOverall, though, I'll be back again, I'm sure, because it's just such a fantastic experience overall."
"""Great fried chicken at reasonable prices.  I'm not a fried chicken expert, but this place was delicious every time.  I personally Price's more than Sallie Mae's in NOLA (who sometimes gets the \""""best fried chicken in America\"""" label).\n\nSome details about this place:\n\n- Cash Only\n- Private parking lot in the back (entrance to parking can be difficult to notice)\n- Takeout only\n- Gets crowded, so be ready to order when you get to the front of the line\n- You can order sweet tea at the counter, for other drinks, there's a soda machine on the side."""
"""Excellent service, artistic, relaxing setting. Hair Klaudt is the best.\n\nKarl Klaudt has been taking care of my friends and family for over 25 years. He and his team (hi Tony!) are always professional. Their hospitality is second to none - in addition to being experts in cut, color and style.\n\nIt's like having your hair done by an artist, which is fitting since the salon supports local artists by featuring their work in an on-site art gallery. Understand: this is not a \""""supercuts\"""". Hair Klaudt understand individual needs and gets it right the first time. Don't trust your hair to amateurs!\n\nHair Klaudt is the best, accept no substitutes."""
"""Le Pommier is a cozy French restaurant that only serves dinner. I will start off by saying that all of the staff are friendly and helpful and the environment is warm and inviting.\n\nI chose the fixed price menu, which included a salad with ch\u00e8vre cheese, Steak with \""""pomme frite\"""" (french fries), and a dessert (Les Smores). \n\nThe salad was tasty, especially with the cheese. The steak was cooked well, but the french fries sort of took over the dish. I was slightly disappointed with my dessert. \""""Les Smores\"""" was a few slices of toasted marshmallows with hard graham cracker-like cookies topped with bitter orange sauce. \n\nMy date ordered the mussels to start, which are served with arugula and sausage in a very tasty white wine and butter broth. We used the leftover broth to dip our bread! For the main course he chose the pheasant, which was cooked perfectly. He also chose a delicious seasonal dessert: a squash cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It tasted like creamy, spicy, autumn-y goodness.\n\nWe also shared a nice bottle of Riesling. \n\nOverall, I was pleased with Le Pommier but found that it was a bit pricey for its small portions and limited menu."""
"Good luck finding better carne asada in town.  This place is crack.  Be prepared to become addicted.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Jr. Carne Asada burritos.  Their quesadillas are amazing too....I don't know how they make them so tasty but they are the best ever.  The only lil complaint I have is that they charge to take the beans OUT of the burrito (.30) but whatever, it's worth it.  The amount of food for the price is great."
Vegas Trophies was able to make me a custom trophy for my husband using an item I bought online when every other trophy store in Vegas said it was impossible. The staff is friendly and professional not to mention they were able to make this custom piece in ONE day! I'm extremely impressed and highly recommend this business!
"Great pizza and great service. These guys are really great, nice people with awesome pizza. Try a cut of plain or spinach with their ranch dressing. You should draft your will first bc you might die and go to heaven. Just sayin."
"Where else can you get huge greasy burgers, fried pickles, and liquor drinks?!  This place is a local favorite for good reason.  Also a great jukebox."
"""This has been my favorite Madison restaurant ever since I walked in 7 years ago.  Their menu hasn't changed in all that time, and I don't mind at all.  Their salad dressing is magical in its deliciousness.  All of their entrees are simple, hearty comfort food--serious meat and potatoes kind of fare!  I took one of the pickiest eaters I've ever met there (she was scared of the place), and she walked away proclaiming it to be \""""delicious.\""""  Try the Coconut Curry Chicken or the Lamb Tibs--they're the shit.  I would also recommend a refreshing \""""Gin & Ting.\""""  \n\nI love the fact that it's a teeny hole in the wall (or hole in the basement, rather).  It makes me feel happy and smooshy inside just to be there, but it's particularly nice in the fierce cold of a Wisconsin winter.  :)"""
Smothered Chicken is the bomb.  Reminded me of my Grandmothers.  Will be back soon
"Went to the Morrison Branch the other day to do a spin class.  I didn't realize they had expanded.  The gym is huge... used to be a tiny place, but I think they did a great job with the expansion (looks like they have plans in the future to expand even more).\n\nUnfortunately this gym is pretty far from my house so I wouldn't go here regularly, but it's nice to know that the facilities have been updated - I didn't get to see if they expanded the pool area/ but there seemed to be a new pool out there as well (it was too dark to see outside when I got there at 6)."
"The perfect blend of old and new--the exterior architecture might not be modern, but the library's definitely with the times in terms of technology.  You can even check your own books out with the self-checkout machine. But, if you're feeling nostalgic for libraries of the past, I know of at least one good ol' fashioned card catalog in the building, in the second floor reference section.\n\nThe place never feels overly crowded--I always find somewhere to sit near the stacks that I'm browsing.\n\nHere's something neat I discovered on the second floor, in the nonfiction section in the back of the building: there are windows that look into the dinosaur hall of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.  You can get a peep at the dinosaurs for free, if you don't have the money for museum admission, and/or enough time to visit the museum."
"""By far the best breakfast in town. Good, clean, simple err \""""classic?\"""" breakfast food without pretension. Fresh orange juice & strawberries. It is a small, nationwide chain (around 75), although each one is managed pretty independently and the menu tailored.Also, as in anywhere the cleanliness of the kitchen & choice of ingredients matters, and this is why I think they do so much better than the others. Many of the standard items, though (like the apple pancake) is superb.\n\nThis is all fine, but the staff is really what makes it excel. Everyone treats you like family.\n\nIt's true that the weekend waits are long. You might take this as a sign. The early mornings and weekends are less crowded, but it doesn't have the same lively vibe."""
biscut and koa come here all the way from the sf bay area for shots and teeth cleaning we came here when we lived here. Now that we moved out we still find that the prices are unbeatable!! we get both the boys teeth cleaned for same price I would pay for 1 in sf. The staff is always friendly you can tell they are true animal lovers ! keep being great !!
"""Adult Slam Puppet show for 18+ was a surprisingly fun evening. I was a little apprehensive about a \""""puppet show,\"""" i mean i haven't seen one since i was in grade school. The evenings show was funny and full of dirty humor, and i have to say i really enjoyed the laughs. Great value too, $10 if you call and book or $12 at the door. \n\nThe venue was an architectural delight, it was an old LDS church that was built in 1929. The high round ceilings and the decorative beams and trim is beautiful. If you go to this building you should definitely take the time to look around and admire it's glory. \n\nSide note: At the adult puppet show they do offer \""""adult beverages\"""" to those of us that are 21 and older.

"So I absolutely love milk tea with or without boba, For awhile I had boba milk tea nearly everyday and so I have tried all the places in town, well most of them anyway.\n\nSo this place does not serve the best milk tea or mixed drinks in vegas, well in my opinion anyway, however it is my favorite place to chill while drinking boba milk tea. The staff is really cool they are really nice, and they get youre drinks out promptly and if there is an issue they handle it professionally. \n\nTheir boba milk tea is not the best but for the price and the environment it is the best deal ive seen.. The tea is not terrible but it will not blow you away either.\n\nHowever you want a quick drink or you want to sit an drink something good volcano tea house is the way to go"
"I paid this place a visit after I finished my Christmas shopping in less than an hour, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The food and the service were both great. Seafood and Cajun food seems to be their thing and they do it right. Great place to go when you're in need of something different."
"Great Waffles, chicken and my favorite----chicken gizzards, gravy and rice.  The peach cobbler was also great.  Only complaint I have is that the coffee, tea, and soft drinks--even though in large containers are too expensive.  One of the most friendly 'wait-staff' I've found in the city."
"Oh sweet Jesus in the manger. Really the first thing I thought of when I woke up today was I would love some papusas. Now this makes for a great restaurant.\n\nWe ordered a big breakfast of fried eggs over easy, plantains, beans and crema and papusas. The papusas are like pancakes - you can ordered them stuffed with beans and cheese or pork! Talk about $1.50, let me order 27. It's quite the bargain $12 check average and we pigged.\n\nI was eyeing every other customers food, they served a shrimp cocktail in a deep glass with salsa and avocados on the bottom, I saw the guy put hot sauce on his shrimp and I wanted to crawl over Julia S. and go sit with them. \n\nThere is a reason this place is packed.\nI wonder what time they open?"
"Okay, I have absolutely no problem giving this place 5 stars. The Pho is amazing! I like my soup simple. Just noodles in chicken broth. I HIGHLY recommend the Lemongrass Beef!! I believe it's #56. I'll have to update next time I'm there. \nIf you're looking for some great Vietnamese food, it's here. \nWant a lot of choices on the menu? Then this is a great place. \nOne of my favorite sides is the egg fried rice. It's just good. There isn't even salt on the table. The cooks know that they season their food to perfection. \nI have to be honest, I'm a little put off by the picture of the pig hanging in the kitchen. I suppose having it refrigerated would be way more comforting. \nBONUS: There is a bottle of sriracha at every table. (~: Love that."
a hidden gem.  This place has some of the best chinese food in the area ... have to drive to Great Wall in Pineville to get better.  Don't knwo what others are complaining about ... have NOT had a bad experience here in years of frequenting it. Recommended.
I been to Hooters many times.  I really like their breaded hot wings.  Service has been hit or miss but overall I will continue to return
"The expanded location is very nice. The food is just as great as it ever was.  I am a huge fan of pizza and Riccio's version should not be missed. Although pleasant, the service was painfully slow, but that's what you get going out on a Friday evening."
"I finally stopped into this blatantly obvious dive bar nestled within Lawrenceville after years of passing by it on my way down to Butler Street. I knew before even walking in that I was going to have a good time. Very Irish. Very Pittsburgh. Very fun. And they serve free popcorn! A friend and I came in, pretty much took over the upper area to play darts for a couple of hours. The drinks are relatively cheap (although I was hoping for cheaper), the bartenders and regulars were very nice. The bar is CASH ONLY, but they do have an ATM in the bar. When the ATM machine didn't hand me out the cash I requested, the owner came right over and said he would call the repairman right away- however, it spit out the money on the second try. I'll definitely stop in again soon."
"Chili's- one of my favorite spots back east!  \n\nI was a little worried that this Chili's would not compare to my local spot back home, but alas, there was no need; it was wonderful!  The very first thing that I noticed when I looked at the happy hour menu in the bar was that they served free chips and salsa, WHOO HOOO!!!  That's not an option back home.  \n\nSunday was happy hour all day so my buddy and I were able to enjoy 4 appetizers for under $20 bucks, what a deal!  The food was all so wonderful and tasty too, it hit the spot! The margarita I had was also worth noting, pretty good for just a traditional, I was worried it might be too sweet, but it was perfect.  \n\nWatch the glass between the bar and dining area, I turned around and a little baby had his faced squished against it and I screamed bloody murder and the whole bar stared at me!  Yikes, just do yourself a favor and keep your eyes on the TV's!"
"Fast, professional and clean \nPlace is we'll kept and employees are amazing at what they do \nGreat place if you want a speedy wait time"
Great alternative to the dealerships. Convenient location near uptown. Friendly service. Took my car in for a quick A/C fix. They were able to fit me in quickly. Have a convenient customer lounge with free wifi while you wait. Great discovery for Volvo owners!!
"A great casual bar/eating with cheap food/drinks but even if you have a suit one you can fit.\nI guess that's the best thing about this bar. You met all kind of people.\n\nThe food is really good (always got on the burgers side), the beer cheap, the waitresses nice.\n\nYou clothes smell like an ashtray but who cares? you spent a great night!"

"Like fellow reviewers, I've never eaten Nepali food outside of here and its sister restaurant Chautara, I've had several amazing meals here. Simple fresh food in the traditionally laid-back State Street atmosphere. Everything I have had was good here. Great for vegetarians and those seeking a unique ethnic-fod experience."

Good location.  They close early though.   Wait staff is older but really good. Very very polite.  Food is cooked to order so allow time for sure if your hungry.  Coconut pancake is delicious.  Groupon makes this even better
"Oh man.. I've been coming to Lupie's since I was in elementary school. It's always crowded, but that gives it this awesome homey feel. It's got perfect tea served in mason jars, delicious chili, good sandwiches, fast service and the best mac&cheese money can buy. What more could you want?"
"I've had Baba Ghannouj before, though it was never as good as last night!!!  This Kabob Grill and the one at Stonecrest have the best Tabbouleh I've ever eaten!  \n\nMet a friend here for dinner last night.  We had:  Lentil soup, Vegetable soup, Tabbouleh, Chicken Kabobs, Lamb Kabobs, Omars Salad (my first time with this salad - It had corn in it), Baba Ghannouj, Pita Chips, Pita Bread, Potato Harra (I've had this before at this place and do not remember how awesome it is - It's like cubed Hash Browns with Garlic and Lemon Juice).  For dessert we had Baklava (Lebanese version, my preference over the Greek) and a Passion Fruit, Raspberry and Mango covered in a White Chocolate shell Bombe.  \n\nEverything was incredible and I will get all of this again and taste some of the other dishes from all areas of the menu!!!  This is a cozy, relaxed atmosphere, with a warm Charm. The service was fantastic - Through and friendly!"
"placed a to go order here last night and our order was ready when i arrived.  mind you i drove all the way from the other side of town just to eat thai food that i knew wouldn't dissappoint.  i had the pineapple chicken thai curry dish.  generally speaking, i dislike peas but they are a nice add to this dish.  spice level was a 7.  absolutely delicious!  my boyfriend opted for the chicken cashew dish which included broccoli.  we both ate every last bite.  we're both fans of the place.  it was good getting it to go too.  it did seem a little pricey being just short of $30 total for both dishes.  it's worth it though- get that thai food fix!  oh and they do deliver now- they had a sign in the window......"
"I had seen this place highlighted on the Downtown Ambassador's facebook page and when they mentioned that it was also a post office, I was thrilled since I have never been able to successfully visit the post office on central due to limited parking. \n\nA few days later I had a several packages that needed to be delivered so I walked down to John and Kathy's. Upon entering I was greeted and the woman working behind the post office window was not only helpful in choosing the best service to get my package where it needed to be on time but also saving me some money by suggesting I use a different box. Overall, this was way better than any post office experience I've had since no one was rushing to get me through a big long line. There was the charge for using my credit card but for the time and money she saved me, I'd gladly pay the $.50. I'll be going here to deliver all my packages in the future!"
"A fantastic little corner grocery. I have very modest needs for my shopping--typically just fruit, whole wheat bread, honey, and peanut butter--so it is the only place i need to go to get my weekly groceries. It has fair prices, and the three sisters who run the place seem really sweet to me."
"I love Peppi's! I always get The Amazing Siegfried. It is a chicken club type of sandwich with bacon, mushrooms, provolone and american cheese. It is delish! I would give five stars but, their delivery guys is always slow and by the time the food gets to me it's semi warm. They have really good fries too!"
"I've eaten here twice in 1 week and ordered the same dish twice. Spudburger with spices and herbs over basmati & yellow rice and a side salad. Everything is fresh and bursting with flavor. My husband who loves meat found the food as delicious as I did.The menu consists of meat, but I would say the food is primarily vegetarian and vegan.\n\nOther reviewers said this place is not Persian food. Honestly, they can call it whatever they want as long as they keep making the food scrumptious."
"We've seen commercials here in the Bay for Joe's...but we've never visited one until we drove by one in Vegas last week.  We walked in not really expecting too much (I was yelping as we were walking in!)...but lo and behold!  We ordered a few (yes, a few!) buckets of crabs and wow!  They were SO tasty!  AND, they didn't have any snow crabs that day, and had to substitute Dungeness for Snow....so we got a lot more for our money!\n\nI think this is the first time that I've ever gotten full off of crabs sans rice!  Though we didn't have vinegar with garlic and salt....the butter did just fine!  \n\nService was also great and we were all glad that we FINALLY got to experience Joe's!  Now it's time to make like a tourist and head over to San Francisco!"
Nothing fancy but you can find what you need here.  There is a cash pay price (which is cheaper) and a card price.  There is one employee I always see and ask questions.  He is wonderful and very knowledgeable.  You'll know him when you see him because he's vertically challenged but he's my favorite!
"I used to live in Charlotte and I've always loved this place.  My ex indulged me and took me here while I was here on business.  I love spicy food and the fact that this place looks a little dive-y lends to it's charm.  I have never had a bad meal here and I've had plenty.  Their cornbread is outstanding and their drink selection--especially the wine choices-- are right on target.  Their vegetarian dishes are great and I've always enjoyed their crawfish, too.  My ex had a great smoky rotini dish and although I don't like any other pasta other than whole wheat, I couldn't keep my fork away from his leftovers when he wasn't looking."
"One of the better pho places in Charlotte! Great pho at a cheaper price compared to some places in Charlotte. Their spring rolls are great too. Of course it's not like Atlanta or west coast good, but if you're in town and want good authentic pho and not care about the interior decorating, then come here."
"Love the prime rib.\n\nThis place is classic old Vegas. I don't think a damn thing has changed in this place since the day it opened. I love the smell of the wood burning and the meat that slow cooks over it. \n\nWhen ever we have company from out of town and they want a steak, this is where we go. This is where we go when I want a steak for that matter. \n\nDon't miss this hidden gem."
"Love this mall.  My friend always takes me when I'm here - just due to the variety of stores.  Mostly mid to high end is how I would describe it.  Macy's, Nordies, Belk, and Neiman Marcus are the department stores.  There is also an Urban, Anthropologie, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Ann Taylor to give you a few examples.\n\nWe had to head to this mall so we could go to Nordstroms, but of course we went walking around to other stores anyways.  \n\nIt is clean, parking is ample and even though today was Sunday it wasn't uber crowded.\n\nAnd yes - there is a section in the mall that has a very strong smoky smell, with no cigar shop in sight.  It's weird, and I chalk it up to there being something else we don't see on the mall level, since this smell is still here, more than 2 years later."
"Menu has a good variety, appealing to many individuals.  Always curious what the Non Traditional Perogies are each time we are there.  Fun atmosphere; however, the meal/food service can be slow @ times."
"Mario's is always a go-to bar if you can't decide where to go among the dozens and dozens of other bars in Southside. This place was my Saturday Afternoon hang out for lunch, college football, and 1 dollar Blue Moon drafts. Food wise, typical bar food, I always get the cajun chicken sandwich and the french onion soup and it never disappoints. I give it 5 stars for being a great local bar with a great staff for happy hour or a couple drinks on a weeknight. Friday and Saturday nights are packed with people, which is normal, being a Southside staple, but it might not be for everyone. Especially if you're over 23 and tired of that scene. I can't count how much money I've spent on the Mario's jukebox(s). All and all, I love it."
"I headed here for a quick bite before meeting up with my sister. I had like 5 minutes before my bus was due but was seriously in and out in two (phew!!)\n\nI ordered the cinnamon raisin bagel with honey walnut cream cheese. I'm seriously obsessed with honey walnut and brought it up to the worker for small talk. He kept the convo going by agreeing with me and saying he loves it on sweet bagels. Sometimes food workers eply with a one word phrase so it was nice customer service to chat with me.\n\nSo super fast and friendly service as well as a tasty bagel. I forgot to order it toasted but that was my fault.\n\nAlso I literally LOVE their blue apple salad.. Chicken, green apple slices, blue cheese & nuts on a bed of lettuce with champagne dressing. I have no idea what champagne dressing is, but it's fabbb!!"
"The best grocery store I've ever been in!\n\nIt was packed full of fresh, organic, local products. The produce looked (and tasted!) amazing. The vegetarian and vegan options were plentiful, and the service we got was friendly and helpful. \n\nThis place would have been a 5 star, except they added a 10% charge because we weren't members, AND they don't sell wine :-(\n\nOther than that - what a place!"
"A favorite of the capitol square crowd.  It's been packed every time I've been there for lunch.  Order at the counter and fight for a seat.  The salads are huge, but everything is just a little pricey...something common around the square.  Nice cushions and pillows on the benches around the restaurant.  Nothing too stand out, but a great lunch staple for a salad or sandwich with a few baked goods as well. 4 stars."
"This place is excellent!! I came here for a smog test, it was about as easy and convenient as you can get. I handed my car to the technician, went to the front counter to pay ($15.99 - cheapest I can find in Las Vegas so far!!!), and by time I got back to my car, I could already see the results of the smog test on the screen- a big fat PASS!!! The whole process took about 3 minutes, maximum. \n\nJim, the smog technician is very friendly and advised me of all the necessary documents I needed to have before going to the DMV to change my car plates (since I was from out of state). He ticked the items off his fingers, making sure I had each and every one of them- smog test, Nevada auto insurance, out of state VIN check at the DMV, car license plates ready in hand, and car registration. That really saved me time as I had all the documents ready to go as soon as they asked.\n\nI will certainly be returning to this place for my oil change and general maintenance. Thanks Jim for being awesome!!"
Just incredible a must see if you are in Nevada
"This is my favorite mexican restaurant.  It is in a very small space so it gets hot inside the restaurant during the summer.  You may want to bring a towel to wipe the sweat off your face during dinner.  But, it is worth it.  The food is that good."
Amazing food.\nService was excellent as well.\n\nI suppose when you pay these sort of prices you would better expect great good followed by great service.
I have been here a few times. I think this place is definitely better than the other common Mexican family chain taco places. I had the shrimp burrito. At first I was kinda iffy ordering shrimp. In the end it was worth the risk. It was the perfect amount of spiciness where it makes you sweat a little but you cant stop eating it. My friends dad got the mole chicken and he swears it was just as good as his ex wife's. I know of several other people that live in the area that also rave about this place. They have dinning tables but its more of a order your food to go place. They cook the food fresh so it will still be piping hot when you get home.
"This is an old church that was turned into a brewery.  I think people mostly go here to drink beer, but since we don't drink, we like to go here for the cool atmosphere & their pizza is pretty darn good."
"Picked up take out from Lotus the other day. Everything we tried was tasty, fresh and didn't leave a weird greasy aftertaste in your mouth like most Chinese take out places. \n\nThey also deliver and you can order online. This is a plus for us. We've ordered in when we had a pajama day and didn't feel like leaving the house. Everything was delivered hot and quickly! \n\nGreat little place!"
"True good old fashioned southern hospitality in the middle of the city.\n\nWas in Charlotte a recent evening and it was getting late for dinner.  I saw this place and since I love diners, especially mom & pop types, I thought I'd give it a chance.\n\nThe place was about 1/4 full with clientele from all walks of life.  The waitress/hostess quickly greeted and sat me.  \n\nI ordered an evening special for about 7.99 that came with a meat, 2 sides, bread and soup; but was disappointed they were out of their complimentary soup.  The waitress did make it up to me and she provided cheerful and fast service.  I would definitely return next time I'm in the Queen City and definitely recommend it."
Best Chinese in town!!! The lemon chicken is so good! Everything here is fantastic. It's this little hole in the wall but the service people could not be even sweeter. Everything is fresh tasting and the batter on the chicken is remarkable. I'm in love.
"There is no better sporting goods outfitter anywhere in Madison! Locally owned and \u00fcber friendly, Fontana is unrivaled when it comes to a one stop shop for all your outdoor adventure needs. Camping, scuba, skiing, hiking, climbing, swimming, fly fishing, snow shoeing, even disc golf! Need new sunglasses or maybe a better winter coat? Get it there! \nSome reviewers gripe about the prices. This store sells high end, quality gear. You get what you pay for. If you want cheap, go to Wal Mart and get exactly that. Fontana is a welcome respite from all of the corporate owned chain stores that are slowly taking over State Street. They also feature a west side store on Junction Rd. I love the downtown store because that's the original spot and it's closer to home. Go NOW!!"
"I think this could be considered a modern day juke joint.  Lots of fun though, great music.  Prices on drinks are okay, they had moscato so I was pretty happy.  The place was packed the two times we went on our 5 day vacation.  Bathroom situation is rough though, just FYI."
"This burger place was really good. I had the number #1 combo(no drink included) for $5.99 which is a pretty reasonable price. Burger was pretty good size,  i dont think theres a need for double or bigger than the Big One. I added bacon and I appreciate its in round shape so it covers more bites than strip bacon. Fries were good as well. Onion rings could be skipped nothing special. We also ordered a side of chili i would skip it too. \n\nIf you know Anthony Bourdains top 3 burger joint in the word named Sams in San Fran then you could compare the flavors and feel. This reminded me of that place. I highly recommend it."
"Good spot.  The Jambalaya is great and the service is excellent.  I'd agree with other posters that this is a more refined toned down cajun fare, but still good.  It was nice to be close to the rest of NoDa (galleries and bars) for some pre and post entertainment."
"Buffet Dynasty is one of the better Asian buffets I've been to.  The quality of their product is adequate and everything tastes pretty good.  The sushi is tiny and not the best, but hey, I can stuff my face with as many tiny rolls as I desire.\n\nThe man who I believe to be the owner is always working the buffet or speaking with customers directly.  Very personable, always smiling.  He keeps the restaurant quite clean.\n\nGo on a weekday during lunch to get the best rate for an adult buffet.  Enjoy."
I have been coming here for years. Everyone is so nice and my cleanings go by fast and painless. Theresa is great and so is Dr. Durisek.
"Wow.  I could not stop eating.  and ordering more.  and eating.  and ordering more.  needless to say the food gets expensive but its so worth it.  \n\namazing sushi.  very high quality ingredients.  love the larger dining area at the new location.\n\ndidnt have any food other than sushi, but noticed the menu was very pricey for the normal food.  oh and strangely the edamame was not hot or even salted.  something I have not encountered."
"I don't know why I never heard of this place before - but I am so glad for the discovery.  It doesn't matter what your looking for the Sleepy Poet has a little bit of everything...Vintage clothes, accessories, lots and lots of cool furniture to choose from - pictures - homes decor....there is no sense in going on and on - you will just have to check it out for yourself.  Plan a couple of hours you'll need it to get through this huge place full\nof awesome stuff. The prices are also very reasonable..."
"I just bought my 40th birthday ring from Chuck Smith, and I must say they did a wonderful job.  I am very picky, and it has taken me since August of 2011 to find the right jeweler!  I literally looked at all the jewelers in town, on the web, even in California.  Chuck was very professional, ethical, honest and definitely knows what he is talking about.  I did not feel he was trying to make a quick sale, but really took the time so that I made the right choice.  Thank you so much to everyone at Morrison Smith, you all will be my lifelong jewelers and look forward to doing business with you all again!!"
"Best doughnut I ever had in town. I didn't even know American doughnut could taste this good...!!! I'm not a big doughnut person but the moment I bite into a doughnut hole (I just couldn't wait till I get home to open the box so I started to eating a bad of doughnut holes while I'm driving...) I was like, OMG!!!!! And I ate all of it:9 I got many different fancy doughnuts everything tasted great. But simple glazed doughnut will show you how great this doughnuts place is."
"This is an awesome bar.  The decor reminds me of the Fraggle Rock underworld and they have a fun 80's night on Friday nights.  It can get pretty packed inside on weekends, but oh well.  Go early if you hate not finding a table.\n\nTues. they have very casual taco dinners, which is fun for a little date thing.\n\nI just love this place. One of the standout  most unique 'for young people' bars in Pittsburgh."
The ladies greet everyone as they come through the door. There may only be a few ladies working but they are a well-oiled machine and can service a full shop in a timely manner. Three of us came as walk-ins and the shop was mostly full. We quickly got seats and had our feet soaking or hands lotioned in no time. It's a small shop but the staff is fantastic and quick. The prices are reasonable ($10 mani/$25 pedi). The atmosphere is very casual and the other patrons are friendly so it's a great place to relax and unwind for a bit. They also rub and lotion your calves which some other local places stopped doing.
"I love Church Brew Works and come here often. They have some great brews and some not so great brews, but they have something for everyone. Their best brews (in my opinion) are the Belgian Tripel, the Mole Stout, the Coconut Stout, and the Dunkel. \n\nI've only eaten off of the bar menu, but I find the food to be consistently good. The pizzas are especially excellent. \n\nThe service is sometimes spotty, but the servers are doing the best they can and are good about communicating about delays. There is one bartender who is kind of a jerk.\n\nThe ambiance is great. It's a stunning location that was the neighborhood's Catholic church for years. The stained glass windows are especially great. For those of you complaining about the smell - it's a brewery! That's what it smells like when they are brewing. \n\nMy only complaint is that they sometimes close early at night depending on the crowd.\n\nThe takeaway growlers are a great value."
"For my 150th review I thought it would be appropriate to celebrate it by reviewing (what I consider) a Phoenix landmark. My most recent visits were for the pre-Halloween party with a Rocky Horror theme and on Saturday for the Witches Ball. I absolutely love the sistah's in drag with the raunchy commentary between sets. \n\nHowever, it does irritate me that purses bigger than a clutch are not allowed into Charlie's. Where are the diva's supposed to keep their make-up!?\n\nThe bar is spacious and there are enough people to go around so you don't feel tied to the same group all night long if you are looking to meet anyone new. But what I thought was most important was the drinks and the prices. I ordered a rum an Coke and watched as the bartender filled the glass with rum, then splashed some Coke on top and only charged me $4. I was in shock. And every drink after that always came filled to the brim with liquor and splashed with something else."
"I had a very positive experience here. I brought in a destination wedding gown and it was altered to my satisfaction in 6 days. Who does that? I received an additional 10 percent off because they have a deal with Bella Bridesmaid in South End. Bottom line, total came to about $45."
"As someone who uses a bicycle daily for commuting purposes and running the occasional errand, I have greatly appreciated the service people at Williamson Street Bikes. Whether it's changing a flat, or a major overhaul of gears, brakes, derailleur, etc., the guys working there have always been polite, informative and helpful.  Although there have been times where I spent a boatload of money on new gear, there have also been plenty of times when they made a quick fix for me at no charge.\n\nIn all, I'm pleased to have such a great resource so close to where I live (and nicely situated on the bike path!)"
Outdoor shopping at its best... probably not the best if its hot outside- but great outdoor dining and misters... :-)
"Not knowing they were awarded the 2010 Best Burger in Vegas (by a local newspaper), we were attracted by the exterior decor.  The inside was colorful (giant platapus...huge cowboy riding a crawfish...).  But the reason I really liked this place was the burger.  Note picture.  I considered dislocating my jaw to get that monster in my mouth. Great service, very good burger (fried egg, bacon, cheese, burger, good veg accompaniment).  Check it out."
"""Any sushi bar is all about quality fish and they have it here! My husband and I are from Cali and we fish for our own kitchen so we know the difference between fresh and \""""sort of fresh but dressed up so you don't notice\"""". Had a nice conversation with Eric, the sushi chef, about fish quality and where he orders his fish from,etc. All of the staff were friendly and service was great..also they carry Asahi Black as one of their beers.....super hard to find and worth trying if you never have...Also tried the Orion beer from Okinawa...very good and also recommended ."""
Tucked in the back.  Great alignment shop.\n\nI called Thursday morning for a Friday morning appointment.  They had me in and out in under an hour.  $75 might be steep for a 2 wheel alignment but you get what you pay for.  Excellent customer service and knowledagble techs.  Clint dialed my Cobalt in and it drives like a whole new car.\n\nThanks guys!
"I went to U of I and visited a few times since but hadn't stayed at this hotel until March 8, with a group of teens staying there for Mock Trial. \n\nLocation is great! Steps from the campus. Even though the Mock Trial was at the law school it was a short drive.\n\nStaff was quite friendly on Saturday for check-in, and they went out of their way to make sure all our rooms were on the same floor; mine wasn't quite ready but they sped it up for us. They were more than happy to give out extra keys for the kids.\n\nRooms were clean; what you expect at a Hampton. My son and I weren't crazy about the pillows as they were small.\n\nBreakfast the next morning was ok; I've had better at this type of hotel.\n\nLady at the front desk at check-out was not nearly as nice as the ones at check-in. Pretty surly and not willing to give us all a late checkout, even for just an hour.\n\nI'd give it 3 1/2 stars but I'll round up due to the staff at check-in."
"The BEST cleaners.  Awesome service, very fair prices, IMPECCABLE work!  Great location and fast turnaround."
"Great, fresh Thai food!  Pad thai and pad see-ew are both delicious.  I had their chicken pad woon sen a couple of years ago and didn't really like it, but I'm so glad I tried it again recently because it is amazing now!  They're definitely generous with the spice in a good way, so I might order down from what you are used to at another Thai restaurant.  We will definitely be back when we get a craving for Thai take out :)"
"I love this place, thanks yelpers! All the Korean food staples are here. I have to say the quality of the ingredients are identical to Greenland.   But A marts prices on meats are WAY better. Dont shy always from the frozen prepared meats, they are worth the price. The staff is friendly but quiet.  They have ricecakes earlier in the day, but run out by mid afternoon.  Will be coming here again and again."
"Consistently good food. I've been here twice, and as a newbie to Charlotte who is compelled to try as many places as possible, that's saying a lot."
"Mmmmmm......Penguin.  A former drive-in that's trying really hard to be funky....I definitely give them an A for effort.  One of the first places I came to eat when I moved to Charlotte because, yep, you guessed it......I saw it on the Food Network!  The most delicious fried pickles I have ever had....even good the next night re-heated in the oven after several beers.  The cheeseburgers are also excellent and the falafal is nothing to sneeze at.   Overcrowded?  Yes.  Tiny?  Yes.   But, for diner fare at a good price, it's hard to beat this little dive overrun with nostalgia.  Try the pimento cheese.....it's the bomb yo."
"It's a great place to meet up with a smaller group of friends.  We had seven in our party.  Anything too much larger and it is going to be a tight squeeze.  \n\nThe food was quite good and the presentation was nice as well.  I started off with the French Onion soup and then had the Grilled Gorgonzola-Stuffed Filet Mignon served on mashed potatoes along with asparagus.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed 300 East and would easily go again."
"Great hidden gem tucked within the strange world known as the Commercial Center. I'm not anti-Lotus of Siam by any stretch--that place is certainly worth the visit for their extensively diverse menu--but equally impressive is Komol.\n\nSpeaking of menu, Komol's is beautifully designed and crafted with some sort of heavy wood, that thing could easily double as a weapon. I was lucky enough to dine here with a nice size meetup group. We were able to sample quite a few dishes, including:\n\nTom Kha\nShrimp Pad Thai\nAngel Duck\nBeef Panang\nPineapple Fried Rice\nDuck Chili Mint\nOrange Tofu\nKang Pa\n\nI won't detail every dish, but I found their duck to be very tender and flavorful. The Panang was pretty good, but I still prefer Archi's. I didn't care for the Pineapple Fried Rice. I was pleasantly surprised by the Orange Tofu.\n\nThe bill totaled $15 per person (with tax and tip). Compared to what I spent at LoS the last time, that's a steal! I'm not going to say Komol is better or worse than LoS. They're both great choices when you're in the area."
"First off, the food is absolutely amazing.  A must visit. Plus the view is spectacular.  But tonight, my review is about the customer service - stellar.  There were a few mishaps with the meal, but if there was ever a way to salvage a mistake, MB did it with flying colors.  The management handled everything perfectly.  But the real applause goes to Jessica, who works in the lounge.  She is on her game, knows how to treat a customer, and, well, is VERY easy on the eyes...  She's the reason I'll definitely be going back.\n\nGreat food, great view, and amazing customer service."
"best pho in vegas! \n\nthink of this place as the GOLDEN DELI of vegas! hahahah all you SGV people kno what im talking about.\n\nthis place is really good, always consistent, clean and super helpful. they dont charge you for tea (hate it when places do that) and they are super good about bringing you extra stuff like limes ect.\n\ni come here all the time, its a little further from the strip than other places, but it is worth the drive, you will never be disapointed. I DO NOT DARE EAT PHO ANYWHERE ELSE (except maybe hue thai) lol Rice plates are good here and other noodle dishes too."
"Had the steak and rice bowl here.\n\nFast friendly service.\n\nFood was delicious.\n\nOnly negative at all was too many veggies, but that may be a plus for some."
Presidential Limo picked us up on time at the airport and at the hotel to go home. The driver was very nice and exactly what we ordered was delivered. I would use this company again.
"""What I like about Bed Bath and Beyond is that they have everything \"""" I didn't know I needed...until I get there and see it\"""" lol\n\nI especially love the great variety of kitchen items...they have everything....pots, pans, gadgets, containers, you name it they have it!  And since my kitchen is for decoration only its only right that I add several of these cool gadgets!\n\n\nI agree that at times the amount if stuff and how its presented can be overwhelming with something to buy from the floor to the celiling but in my opinion it's totally worth the trip!"""
"I have wondered what this place was like for a long time--Glad I listened to the fellow yelpers. The meat lasagna was marvelous! We have a great family recipe and are always very critical of other lasagnas--as many others know few can compare to a good homemade lasagna but this one is outstanding.\n\nTry it out some night, stop in and pick up the premade lasagna, cook it at home for the family. It was $19 for a platter that could feed a family of 6 comfortably. You could also get the individual serving to taste if you don't believe me."
"Listen, this place is awesome! The food is good the atmosphere is perfect, the location is the best! What a great staff! Sure, the food isn't gourmet, but they don't advertize that! You will be satisfied with everything on the menu, in fact, you will take a double check when you get your check. This place doesn't claim to be cheap eats, I think, because it is very trendy. Wings, chicken fingers, sandwiches, nachos, etc. are all available. I am not a dessert guy, but hold on to your ass! Easily the best desserts in the city. The staff are clean and knowledgeable. The owners are not strangers to the dining room floor to make sure you're happy. Groups are welcome and accommodated. Full bar with the nicest bartenders! A Pittsburgh staple!"
"BEAUTIFUL mall. High ceilings, clean, mmm shopping. The familiar scent of Nordstrom (they do really have a scent) gave me nostalgia of my local Nordstroms. \n\nAvoid the Apple Store, it's a zoo in there. Even more a zoo than any other store I've been to, probably because it's the only one in the vicinity. Avoid!\n\nI need to come back to try the froyo!"
"So stoked Madison has a UO. I love this store, compared to others this one is a whole lot smaller. But I love the unique cloths, vintage and retro. I've read other reviews I don't think they're over priced at all. I still have dresses from 5yrs ago that look brand new. Its a fun funky store I recommend."
"Chicken Pot Pie Wednesdays... How I love thee!!!  I have only been here on Wednesdays and it's the only day that they serve up the Chicken Pot Pie meant for the Gods.  They only make a certain number for the day but if you get there before 12:30pm, then you should be fine.  It really starts getting crowded after 12pm.  The Pot Pie is large and you really concentrate hard if you want to finish it in one sitting.  There is no shame with taking the rest home and saving it for late night grub.  Still good!!  Also, definitely try the green sauce on the table.  Mmmmmm mmmm.\n\nAlthough I haven't tried the other food there (BBQ Homestyle), I've only heard the best things.  So give it all a try.  But honestly, 5 stars for the Pot Pie.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."
"Roberto's, Roberto's, oh how do I love your greasy, authentic goodness that is classified as Mexican food. When I lived in Las Vegas, I went to school not to far from this location, and Robert always did me good during lunch period. And, if not then, then after-hours. Oh, how I miss stumbling in to Roberto's at 3am for some of the best drunk food I've ever experienced. If you want light (as light as you can get at Roberto's), go for the taquitos with cheese and guacamole, and mix the red and green sauces at the condiment bar. My personal fav would have to be the made-to-order carne asada burrito with cheese and guacamole added also with the mixed red/green sauces. I miss it just thinking about it. One time, I ventured off and tried the breakfast burrito which was as equally tasty, but I know that the carne asada burrito missed me so I had to go back (what can I say, I'm a sucker for love)."
"I have never had anything bad from Amy's Cafe!!!  We usually get delivery and just blindly order the soup of they day as no matter what it is it is delicious!!!  Some of my favorites are the Greek salad with chicken, veggie wrap, cesear salad...basically everything!!!"
"Greenbush is an institution. Whether you're meeting someone for a drink & some authentic Italian antipasto or you're planning a noisy family reunion with pizza to die for, this inconspicuous basement hideaway has it all. Top it off with a good wine selection & fabulous wait staff that don't pester you, and you might think you're back in Italy for a second. A must-do whether you live in Madison or not."
Great donuts! Absolutely love the cinnamon twists and apple fritters. Wish I could have brought a box back to Honolulu :(
"I am a fan of their coffee, fun space, and long standing history of quality service.  I visited this shop over 12 years ago, not much has changed and that's just fine by me.\nVintage maps and a old school feel, looks just right on Willy Street gives off a good vibe.  The place is usually quite full, so hard to grab a spot in the colder months.  \nLove that they place some tables out front in the summer.  \nBonus: Parking lot right next to building.\nMinus: It's too quite for a conversation or a loud mouth like me."
Komol versus Lotus of Siam.... Went to both during our foodie adventure tour of Las Vegas and hands down the winner by far is Komol!  \n\nFor fresher veggies and a more broad protein and seafood selection Komol has it.  Interestingly we went to Lotus of Siam first but chose not to wait in line for an hour during peak dinner time due to having show tickets so we stumbled upon Komol (same shopping center) .  We were blown away by the soft shell crab entree and chicken with greens that we just had to see if Lotus was THAT much better. The next day we went to Lotus and had Nam Prik and Khao Soi (their signature Northern Thai dishes) and wasn't that impressed.  Not much flavor in the Khao Soi and the Nam Prik was like any I had before.  \n\nLotus of Siam overrated - for sure!
"We came here for breakfast and I liked this place. I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was perfect. The taste was great and the size was good (maybe too small for others). The bread was absolutely fantastic- I ordered a side since it was THAT good. My wife had an omelette, which was good but nothing extraordinary. \n\nThe atmosphere was a bit too big and open for me. For breakfast, I tend to like more quaint, homey-feeling places. This atmosphere was a bit 'cold' for me but the food distracted me enough to where it wasn't an issue. \n\nI haven't been here for other meals but I'd recommend it for breakfast!"
"I love this place.\n\nIt's close enough to my place that I can still go out, without going all the way downtown. For those nights when I'd just rather keep it real with my friends, at the Schwoegler's sports bar (which has ample HDTVs) or out on the lanes.\n\nThe bar offers good specials and great service, and the lanes are well maintained and utilize quality scoring systems. Oh, and their league nights are very well managed too.\n\nReally, this is a bowling alley... I'm not sure how to write the glowing review that it deserves, but it is a great establishment regardless of my writer's block."
"Good steak, cooked right, with great service. Our waitress was very nice, my salad was great, my baked potato was great and my steak was excellent. The beer was cold and the bread was good as ever. My only complaint was the Texas Chili I ordered was cold. We were here on a Monday night around 08:30pm and it was pretty busy"
"""Don't expect fine dining. If you want a nice, greasy burger, you really can't go wrong with this place. Also, they have a neon \""""salads\"""" sign, and that's just pure awesome."""
Their al pastor really stood out for me. The  salsa verde was great and had a good amount of heat. The salsa roja was overly smoky/chipotle-y for my taste. The al pastor burrito or tacos and some salsa verde washed down with a jamaica: Uuummmm.  Worth the drive to a sketchy area.
"What a great, little store! I finally tried it after reading all the reviews. I went in a while ago, but it was after 3pm and they do not serve food after that time (they do, however, continue to make smoothies). This time around I made sure to get there well in advance.\n\nI tried a Tofu-brat with sauteed onions and peppers. It was served on a wheat bun.My husband got the veggie burger. There isn't a place to sit and eat inside, but there are two patio swinging chairs in the front. I'd suggest eating on the porch or taking it to one of the nearby parks. \n\nThey make it fresh and while you wait you can check out all the natural and organic products. I didn't try a smoothie, but many other customers did and I think I'll return to try one. The smoothies looked very refreshing and good for you!"
"When I first moved to Charlotte I did not know about NoDa, so when 55 scoped this place out he told me I would like it.  He was correct!  This is a cool place with cool customers and Cools as customers which is important in this particular situation!\n\nI like the Espresso and I like the Hot Chocolate even more!  The Staff is always very friendly and have always been successful in making something good for me!\n\nThe inside of this place is as cool as the patrons who like hanging out here."
"We were looking for a good deal on Glasses for that after 40 eye thingy.  Eyeglass world was a pleasant surprise. \n\nMy husband and I both agreed that the eye exam was one of the most thorough we've ever had.  He checked everything, far, close, reading, computer, light, dark, etc.  Then gave many lens and power options.  The eye exam was $68 each.\n\nI ended up chosing a no line bifocal for reading reports and computer use.  and for my free pair a straight reading pair. \n\nMy husband got a no line bifocal for distance and reading and a Calvin Klein distance sunglass for driving. \n\nThey kind of hit you hard for all the lens upgrades like no glare and no scratch, etc.  We passed on most of it and the glasses are fine. \n\nThere are frames to choose from $79 to $300.   With most buy one, get one free. \n\nAll four pairs of glasses were ready by the end of the day.\n\nThe staff was friendly and efficient.  \n\nA good deal all around."
They do gel manicures very well. Mine stayed for weeks!
"I like going to Bombay Bazaar because its very clean, smells nicer than other ethnic stores and the layout makes for very quick and easy shopping.  I never have to ask where the 'Toor daal' is or 'moong daal' is because if you follow the categories, you'll find what your pantry needs :)\n\nI also like supporting this mom and pop place.  They're warm and kind and always greet us with a big 'Namaste'.  Prices are fair and vegetable are fresh.  Good place to go for Indian shopping."
"Every time I make a Vegas trip I hit up this place on the way out. This is so far the closest thing in BBQ away from Memphis. I have only ordered the baby backs, but I am confident that the rest is just as good. Slow cooked, smokey, and fall off the bone goodness.\n\nDon't forget to take some Apple Ice Tea to go!"
"Great food. Can get very crowded. One of the best breakfast places in Madison, but skip if you do not want to wait in line."
I'm very happy that there are new owners. No need for details but I'll just say that the new owners are more friendly and customer-oriented. The longer hours are GREAT!
"Really good rice and falafel, Cash only. The falafel isn't too dry. I wish they used more yogurt sauce... but all in all a good meal. Hummus was nice too!"
"I am giving this restaurant 4 stars rather than 5 solely because I have never actually stepped foot inside the building - I have just ordered sushi from them on the regular for about 3 months now! Their delivery is fast, their sushi is well made and fresh.  You can get fancy rolls and they are good, but the stand bys (salmon chirashi! yuuuuum) are great and fresh.  Also it is really easy to order online for delivery.  As a true sushi fan who would eat sushi everyday if I could,  I appreciate these things!"
"Absolutely delicious, flawless chicken and waffles.  A must-try if you love fried chicken and/or waffles.\n\nOne item of note though: coffee is $3.  Yes, three dollars.  It was fine, but I think I paid about six times what I would have paid at Starbucks.  So that seemed a bit high to me.  However, the food was delicious and well worth it.\n\nA very cool vibe, clean, bright, well-maintained with great photos and art all over the place.  Gospel music playing loud at 7AM on a Friday morning.  A great waitress.  A lot of fun."
"A very functional, yet charming venue in Spring Mountain.  Service is robotic but fast.  Food comes out even faster, which is ALWAYS a + for me.\n\nThe noodles are prepared tasty and the soup is not too oily as well.  Very good combination of the two.  I don't know about their dish menus too much, but I tried them several times before and they were OK.  Bottom line, the price is good, food is awesome, I recommend it.  It is one of the better Pho locations in Spring Mountain.\n\nPRO: Pho is good, service is fast\nCON: Not too much to complain about, service can be a little iffy at times"
"Fanattics is the friendliest bar in Squirrel Hill. The bartenders make it a point to know your name and remember you after your first time visiting. It is not a superficial friendliness either, I've only been there three times but I feel like I've known everyone who hangs out at Fanattics for a long time. The patrons are just as friendly as the staff. Within five minutes of sitting down I had people telling me their life stories.\n\nMost people who hang out here are in their mid twenties to early thirties and hang around the pool table or just chill out at the bar and watch some random game on the television.\n\nFanattics probably has the best drink specials in Squirrel Hill. Every day has some beer for 1.50 and Tuesday nights is $3 micro and import night. They also have food specials every night but I have never tried the fare offered here but it looks like standard bar food choices. \n\nIf you are looking for a friendly, low-key night try Fanattics and you won't be disappointed."
What a fun place to shop for womens clothes. They have FLAX as well as other funky casual brands. Lots of accessories and a few home goods and children's items. I only wish they had larger sizes not all mediums.
"Pretty much like every other well run Taco Bell I have gone to. If you like one, you will likely this one. All your familiar favorites with pretty good service."
"I usually see Maureen Parker, who I am grateful to for practically saving my life! I've only seen Dr Sparks once but I like her too. This has been the best doctors office I've ever been too. The waits can be a bit long but I expect they are giving other people the detail care they are giving me so I don't mind waiting."
"I can't even begin to tell you how great these gals are to work with! I called on MLK Day with a RUSH order - same day - custom design t-shirts - and they were my 4th call (no one else in the area could help me in less than a week!). Nataly was a superstar help. She was so professional. Was speedy quick, explained everything thoroughly, was kind and sweet and all things great! I couldn't believe the professionalism and service. WOW. She even arranged personal delivery of the shirts to my hotel in downtown. 5 Stars All Day! Thanks 3Nuts. You rock!"
the best donuts in the world\n\ncash only
"The food is the star if the show here!  Don't get me wrong, the place has been remodeled and looks GREAT inside.  The dining area is totally separate from the bar so you can enjoy smoke free eating.  The ribs at $15.95 are a BARGAIN!  They have SO much meat on them.  You cannot and will not find better for the money ANYWHERE!  Not even Ellis Island.  You can't beat their quality and price.  For you cigar lovers, check out Doc's Cigar Lounge....On West Charleston, West of Valley View...Enjoy!"
"Just commenting on the food. I get the chicken wings , my friend gets the steak special which is 10$ ...awesome food when you have been out all night. Can't beat the price ...it is very divey but that's why it's cheap. Best wings in Vegas..."
"I have been to Spring valley Hospital several times and each time was a great experience. I had to go to the emergency room each time. There I received prompt and caring help. Up in my room, when admitted, the care was warm and compassionate."
"Yes! Somewhere with non-watered down ice coffee!\n\nIt's definitely a rare treat for me when I order an ice coffee that doesn't end up tasting like coffee-flavored water with ice. I do realize that if I wanted that, I shouldn't be ordering an iced coffee, but I do what I want. \n\nAnyways, with a good selection of coffee and teas, you will surely be caffeinated enough to crank through that 10 page paper due 5 hours ago. \n\nThere's a fair amount of seating, including a back section that I just recently discovered. The seats are pretty close to each other though, so prepare to get comfy with whomever you're with."
"They're good on all the standards. Coffee is fresh and affordable. No frills here, but it's a cute place that's dependable and inviting. I'm admittedly a bit of an eco geek, so I get a kick out of the fact that they use biodegradable plastics, too!"
"A small, in someone's living room feeling, restuarant that will make anyone smile when the walk in. The portions are large, the prices low, the staff seems like they feel right at home. Locals come and go as you eat, and you can help yourself to the drink selection in the cooler in back (they have TING!) \n\nIts Jamaican style cooking, but they go so far beyond the standard fair. None of it is gourmet, but the fish I had was superb. \n\nSo, if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive meal in a festive environment that makes you feel at home - check out Jamerica."
"I found this store when I had a yard sale and had left over baby clothes that did not sell. Its such a wonderful idea considering how fast kids of all ages grow out of clothes!! \nFor the items that were wanting to be purchased, I was given the options of store credit, or cash. Typically they will give you more money if you opt for store credit, but the cash offer isnt bad either :)\nThis place has lots of options at really reasonable prices, and the staff is always super friendly and thankful!! The only suggestion would be the amount of inventory is alot for the shelfs and walls, but there is always more than 5 customers in the store, so im sure they sell alot of the product as well!! :) I definitly recommend anyone to sell, and shop at this store :)"
Dr Arnold is a no-nonsense professional. His staff are always friendly and courteous. I would highly recommend him.
"""You want super fast food and amiable service? Well, this is the place to go for super fast 8\"""" subs. You'll need to pay for the parking meter though to eat at this place."""
"""Great lunch food, you can be in and out of this place, even if it's busy, in less than 40 minutes. Parking can be a challenge. Don't be deceived by the \""""hole in the wall\"""" look. It's actually quite nice.\n\nThe chicken is excellently cooked, but I find the \""""Jaco\"""" (pronounced jack-o) sauce something you want to skip because it overwhelms the flavor of the dish. You can be very happy with nothing more than a half or quarter chicken and a side. My favorite is the squash casserole. Also try the chicken on rice con queso which is sometimes a little light on the chicken but the rice and queso (cheese sauce) is great!\n\nDaily specials, when the guys in the office go together, we try to get here on pot-pie day (four stars) or meatloaf day (five stars!).\n\nThere's a salsa bar if you want to add some special flavor and when they say \""""hot\"""" they mean it. Fountain drinks and sweet/unsweet tea available and some bottled beers."""
"""This is the first place in Vegas that let me book my shows. They started it all for me. I like this place but never work things out with them where it profits us to play here. the bands love this place and beg to play here. They get some huge acts sporadically coming through here also. The drinks are affordable and the sound is excellent for a medium sized club. I will always like this place and support them, long live The Cheyenne Saloon!!! \""""PAN\"""""""
"Great food, great prices, and good service.  The decor could definitely be updated but overall great."
"The best and healthiest Soul food in Charlotte!\n\nThere no pork, sugar nor MSG cooked into the food.  The price is very reasonable and servings are filling.  You will leave there very satisfied. \n\nThe atmosphere is friendly and one could easily engage in a great conversation  with others."
"i have been going to Eyes and Optics since I needed glasses over 20 years ago.  Since the new rage is the old school 60's Birth control glasses I am happy to have been a trend setter for over 2 decades:) The difference with the ones I wear is that Eyes and Optics has the coolest selection of frames in the Valley. So I can find hipster glasses, nerdy glasses or super professional looking ones. Looking at my profile picture you can tell what I picked to wear daily. \n\nI love the store, the staff and the doctors. They never make you feel rushed, they are knowledgeable and very helpful. Even if they didn't take my insurance I'd spend the money to come here because of the staff."
"My sister, my brother in law and i went here last night and it was wonderful!  Pete our server was terrific!  He was fast, nice and had an awesome margarita suggestion!  Only issue we ran into was that the fajitas where a little salty and my jalapeno mashed potatoes didn't have the cheese melted on it but everything else was delish!! Totally coming back and hope we get Pete again, that guy is the bee's knees plus his beard would make any man jealous :)"
"The Hyatt is a really nice hotel.  It's conveniently located close to the convention center and right across the street from the symphony hall.  \r\n\r\nThere is a business center, gym, several ball rooms, as well as meetings rooms within the hotel.  There's also a cafe and bar/restuarant to feed and nourish your hungry and thirsty souls.\r\n\r\nThe elevators are extremely fast almost too fast to stomach.  The view was really beautiful in my room on the 18th floor.\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't enjoy the whole weekend was the fact that the main light in my room was out the entire weekend.  I mentioned it the first night and they never came to change it out."
"What could be better than a combination yarn store and coffee shop? It seems the Sow's Ear keeps getting bigger and better every time I stop in. The yarn selection is excellent and the staff is absolutely wonderful. Some yarn shops feel intimidating when you walk in the door... even a bit pretentious. But the Sow's Ear is like a second home, where no one will judge you for asking a beginner's question or knitting with (gasp) Red Heart. \n\nThe rewards program is really nice - you get a plastic card that is scanned every time you buy. Everything is electronic (no paper punch card to lose)."
"Awesome authentic NOLA food and atmosphere. I travel to that part of the country and this is as good as it gets. Portions are huge, fresh, and fairly priced. Great local and micro beer selection and tasty desserts. Does get pretty busy on weekends so just be prepared to wait... Fast bartenders make that tolerable! One time had fried green tomatoes that were out of season, but that's the only negative in 10 visits."
"This was my first experience with Nepalese food - it's similar to Indian food, but what we ordered was less saucy than Indian food. I highly recommend the Chef's Choice appetizer plate, the dal, and the fish dishes. The chicken tandoori also looked delicious! Service was just ok, but the food was delicious and healthy! This restaurant is an expansion of Himal Chuli a few doors down."
La'wan's  has the best Mac n cheese I ever had. All of there offerings are just like mama used to make. If you want some good comfort food this is the place. Fried chicken. Fantastic. Cornbread. Awesome. They always make you feel right at home too. A lot of times La'Wan comes out and greets her customers. They all treat her like family. Everyone is so nice there. I feel like they adopted me. I never leave hungry.
"This is one of my favorite stores to go to. The girls here are kind and patient, definitely willing to help a customer out. They greet you from the moment you come in through the door and want you to leave happy.\n\nThey don't try to dis other stores if you bring in other business but will talk to you"
"We keep coming back!  The food is fantastic and we have never had a problem with the service.  Actually, the service was phenomenal!  Drinks were refilled before they were close to empty.\n\nWe both ordered the Pernil de Cerdo Asado with a side of Platanos Maduros.  Just writing about it has be drooling!  YUM\n\nYes, it is inside the Howard Johnson.  Yes, the parking situation isn't the best.  And, yes, it is on the strip - but not really - way past the end.  However, for all those faults it still warrants 5 stars.  The food and service were that good.  \n\nWe can not wait to go back!"
"I've been going to Woodlands for something like 15 years. It is by far the best Indian food I have ever had anywhere I've lived. Every time I come to Charlotte, I try to go to Woodlands to get my fix. It's hard to pick a favorite dish there. Order the appetizer sampler and anything else. It's all truly delicious."
"Very fast and friendly service.  This is definately a no-frills place and there is nowhere to sit down and eat in the restaurant, BUT it is a great place for take-out!  The woman/cashier I deal with every time I go up there always seem to know instinctively what my order is and she is always very nice and accommodating.  The food portions are LARGE and everything is always very GOOD."
"I'm so happy that I went with Ganser on my project to turn my screened in porch into a 4 season!  I did my due diligence getting multiple quotes and ended up with Ganser.  They offered constructive opinions as I wasn't sure what I wanted to have on the exterior and I took their advice.  Their quote was more than competitive with other companies offering similar exterior treatments.  My porch exterior has a clean, finished look that I had hoped would look good, but it turned out far better than I would have expected.  The crew worked in sub-zero temps and were completely professional.  I will be contacting them for future projects!  Hands down."
the tacos are off the hook yummmmmmmmy
"Donald Haack Diamonds is an amazing store with an amazing staff.  Not only is the selection unbelievable, but the staff is so knowledgeable and really take their time to figure out exactly what you want.  They will even set you up with a wish list.  The next time your significant other wants to get you something nice, they can come by the store and get the list of items you have picked out.  I appreciate the fact that you never feel pressured.  It was an all around great experience and I would highly recommend them!"
"well worth a visit if you've never been.  if you have half as good a time as i did, you'll walk away pleased."
"The tom kha khi is amazing here!  It is very creamy, well balanced and flavored.  It has small slices of galanga, mushrooms, chicken, basil leaves, and other yummy herbs.  This was one of the better tom khas I have had in a long time!\n\nI also had the shrimp with yellow curry sauce.  It was lightly sweet, and more of a paste than a liquid curry.  It had lots of bell peppers in it.  The flavor was good, although I thought it could have been a little more potent.  I probably would order this hotter next time.  \n\nAlso tried the mint chicken, and unfortunately I wasn't a big fan of this version.  I felt like the mint sauce was a little bland, and a bit salty (although my friend didn't detect any saltiness).  \n\nI enjoyed my second visit to Mr. Chop Chop, and would frequent this place again even though it is a long drive for me!"
"I tried Carrie at Massage Pro based on the reviews on yelp.  I agree with the other reviewers: she is a very good massage therapist.  I appreciated that she asked questions to customize my massage and understand what areas I needed her to focus on, but then during the massage we didn't talk (I prefer to enjoy a massage with no talking).  She also took time after the massage to talk to me about my problem areas.  I went in for a deep tissue massage and was very happy with it.  \n\nThe website was easy to use to book my first appointment (Saturday night to get a Sunday massage - I was so happy!)  I think the massage prices are very reasonable.  The building is not anything impressive, but the room was clean and comfortable for my massage (dimmed lights, very light music, etc).  \n\nI will be going back and would recommend Carrie to my friends."
Omg the best chicken ever !!!!\nA little expensive but I guess you get what you pay for. It's southern fried chicken skin is amazingly flavored love the green beans and fried green tomatoes can't find those anyplace.guarantee you will love the chicken .
"""LOVE their new redesign and renovation!! It looks totally different and WAY classier! It does not look like the stereotypical \""""asian restaurant\"""". I love it when restaurants/stores/companies REINVEST their money into their own businesses because they have pride in their business. This is definitely a company that takes pride in their business.\n\nI always see their employees cleaning or shining utensils. I love shiny utensils! \n\nPlus they never rush you...even if you come in 20 min before closing. (sorry about that Saigon!)"""
"Booked a limo for a couple hours after my wedding to take photos around strip. Josh, our driver was great and very professional. I thought the limo was going to be just a regular one but it was a cadillac escalade  which was much cooler.  Complimentary champagne, very nice leather interior with touch screen music player and light show."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE. My second review, yes--but I wanted to see if I could add a sixth star. Came back here three more times, and every single time the owner has come out and talked to me. He's such a great guy and totally boosts this place. GO GO GO."
"Best Vietnamese restaurant in Madison.  The pho is delicious!  Atmosphere is clean, but not very cozy.  I wish I lived closer to go more often!"
Ron our sales rep was great and very friendly.  We didn't spend more than 2 hours there from start to finish and drove out of there in a beautiful 2014 CTS VSport that is a fantastic car.  Everyone there was great and made us feel as if we were royalty.  The finance department was also very friendly and helpful.  I am telling all of my friends and business contacts about my experience and very happy to give them a great review.  Thanks again Ron and everyone at Cadillac West.
"Interesting place because the coffee shop really is there to support knitters! \n\nMy wife wanted to stop there to see why a couple of her friends raved about the place. Since I am knot into knitting (and probably might stab myself) I will not rate their raison d'etre. \n\nI had a mocha cappuccino. Very good & rich. Reasonably priced. My wife had an Italian soda. \n\nSupposedly they carry what is considered to be a very good brand of coffee. \n\nMy wife had an almond scone. I tasted it. Better than most I have tasted. \n\nI had a tuna on warm baguette. I thought it very good. It comes with some nice greens and a delicate dressing. Also very good. About $7.00 if I remember correctly. \n\nI number of women were there, knitting away, having fun. A warm and cozy shop. Friendly staff. \n\nAll this made for a relaxing lunch. \n\nAs you can tell from the name, porcine figurines and items are a focus."
"Working across the street from this jewel of a donut shop is a plus. Whenever I get the craving for a tasty chocolate cake donut, I know Real Donuts will always deliver. I have tried other donut shops, including the more commercial shops but I find myself always comparing their donuts to the ones I get at this little shop. No one beats them! Friendly staff, great service and good prices. Once you try them once, you will become a repeat customer guaranteed!"
"The drinks are overpriced... however(!) this is a great little intimate spot to see an up and coming band.  The bartenders are decent.  The people are friendly at most shows.  The bands play on a stage right in the middle of the floor, so really you could chat afterwards with them.  it's in a good place in the South Side.  It's located near the 10th street bridge so vacating South Side after a show is simple, provided you parked near it.  Also taxi's are easy to catch from"
Wonderful Food
I was working graveyard when I ordered for carryout to this place. The bar tender handles everything at this point and was so nice and friendly. She talked to me over the phi phone like we'd been friends forever and when I got there to pick up my food same thing. The food came out hot and fresh and she loaded me down with sauces which is something I always hole for. My jack Daniels burger was so bomb. That's what I usually get and it's delicious.
Great and cheap!
"While I prefer the layout of the Eastside Boston Store, this location has a good spot mid-mall and has certain things not found elsewhere: a Bobbi Brown counter and a really big handbag selection. Always good service here and competitive pricing."
I had the raspberry cheesecake for dessert yesterday.  Wow!!!  Good stuff.  My mom had the baklava-very nutty if you like baklava. It was like eating desserts on steroids!
"This place is awesome. It's a nice chill spot after getting off work late and hanging out with friends. I love most of their warm milk teas, especially the almond milk tea. Actually, I pretty much like all of their milks teas, cold and warm. The staff pretty much leaves you alone except when you first get there (which is understandable). Their tactics for getting you to order instantly is a little intimidating I will admit. They just stand behind you until you're ready to order -_- I like how they place all of the teas on the shelves for everyone to see. It adds color and ambience to the place. I am already a regular and will continue to be one.\n\nSide note: I was iffy about coming here the first time because one of my close friends told me that she came here and hated it. She ordered regular boba drinks (not totally sure which ones) and almost all of her friends puked. My experience was nothing like this."
"The original reviewer covers most of I have to say about this place. Everyone working is fantastic in helping you find what you need.  The food is fantastic (I had the kebab) and the servings generous.  I probably should have made two meals out of what they gave me, instead of eating it all in one go.  If you can apply the concept of hospitality to a grocery store, this place would fit the bill.\n\nThe grocery is small, but nice, with a variety of spices essential to cooking Middle Eastern and South Asian food, as well as a number of things like pita, mango drinks, figs and dates, and sweets. I've yet to try the butcher.  The prices are very reasonable."
"We have been using Joe's services for 5+ years and have always had great service.  We are on a bi-wkly schedule and our yard has never looked better.  Their prices are very reasonable and they have discounts available if you qualify.  Joe is very personable and will go out of his way to make sure you are completely satisfied.  My next door neighbors originally started using them for just the pre-emergent (to keep weeds from popping up), and now they are on a bi-wkly schedule also.  Even if you just have them come twice a year to do the pre-emergent, it's a LOT cheaper than paying the fines the HOA charges...lol!!  ;-)"
"I've been shooting pool in this place for years.\nIn fact, within the past few years they upgraded their tables to Diamonds, which are my favorite tables.\nThe owner is very friendly and I can't remember a night that I've been there and not seen him, which is uncommon for a lot of pubs in this area.\nIt's a shame that their kitchen shut down after the smoking laws came into effect, because the food was pretty good.\nThey have video poker, a nice (but often too loud) jute-box and a rather substantial dance-floor and stage.\nThey also have bands in there regularly on Fri. and Sat. nights (but they're also a little too loud for me...I'm old).\nI know the place inside and out, and when I'm there, I usually know most of the other people in there as well.\nBut I've seen people walk in there for the first time, and they seem to just blend in like family.\nThat's the atmosphere...It's welcoming."
The Bugsy Siegel omelet is the stuff dreams are made of. Okay maybe just my dreams but still. The tender chunks of italian roast beef and melted mozzarella cheese inside of an omelet are pure heaven to me. The home style potatoes are equally delicious. This location seems less busy than the other and usually has 2 for 1 coupons in the paper. The service is always prompt and friendly.
Love everyone that works here. I've been going here for at least 3 years now. i would say 4 out of 5 times everything is perfect. I dont care what time it is super mex is always my first choice !!
The older strip mall location is deceiving... Give it a try! You won't be disappointed. The owner is fantastic. So gracious. I loved the hot rock bi bim bap!
"The best in pizza in Pittsburgh, though it's very similar to Mineo's...just a bit better."
They always are friendly and patient with me...I'm the type of person who stands there for 5 mins saying hmm an ummm an shesh what should I get...plus I love the condiment station...I pack a ziploc full if those carrots and peppers oh so yummy for my tummy!!!plus they have great deals on mondays they have 1.99 breakfast burritos...Wednesdays they have 1.99 chicken tacos seriously I could eat here all week...then again my body wouldn't be happy with all the working out I would need to do...thank you Roberto's for feeding me such delicious food ^_-
"""Love to fill my apt full of a \""""world traveled\"""" feel.\n\nPrice - somewhat affordable to expensive (maybe its the furniture)\n\nThere's an abundance of selection of knick-knacks. I always come away with something! The best thing I have purchased as of yet: my made in India - dark Expresso console table that I always get complimented on, a pair of glass tea set infuser that my friends are in awe of, my nice jewelry box made of dark wood and aluminum lid with intricate designs, and various foods! \n\nJust pricey at times, and the sale/coupon doesn't do enough justice! Hence, my four stars for WM."""
"Came here tonight with my boyfriend and 2 out of our 4 kids. The waitress was really nice. The wait time wasn't bad. I had the grilled chicken Caesar salad and it was really good. The others had a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, peppers, etc on it. Both kids (2&3) each ate a 1/2 slice and the boyfriend ate 3. So I'm assuming they all enjoyed it! I would love to come back on a cheat meal day and really try some of their other stuff out. Only negative is the prices are a tad high."
"Espresso rocks. Coffee is so good. Food is over priced a bit, but still great. The space is a bit '90s. Overall, I would drive quite a way to get coffee here. I am a huge fan of Intelligentsia. I felt their espresso was represnted really quite well."
"I've been to many Jimmy Johns around Central Illinois, but this one is by far the best. The restaurant is a great size, so there is always seating and the service is very fast. I mean faster than they claim. I love the sandwiches and will never get  tired of eating here. The only downfall is that you have to pay the meter to park in their lot."
"I've walked by this place a lot & it's always packed with Asians (a good sign if you like really good food). Slid in on Memorial Day for a quick lunch & had the beef scallion pancake, fried dumplings & a lemon tapioca smoothie. There was only one server there taking care of everything (host, server, & busser) & she was very attentive, polite, patient, & helpful to a newbie like me. Smoothie came quickly followed by food & all were excellent. Scallions & dumplings were crisp & delicious, & drinking lemon tapioca ice through a big straw is a very cool experience. It was a small meal & I left feeling not thoroughly satisfied but vowed to return.\n\nA week later, I ordered 3 vegetable spring rolls, spicy short ribs w/ rice & a kiwi smoothie, & this time left with a belly about to burst. Spring rolls were fresh & hot (but not too hot) & just hit the spot. Ribs, I abandoned the chopsticks with, & ate them like I was at KFC #FingerLickinGood, & I experienced brain freeze on my Kiwi ice. \n\nI haven't been back since but will never forget the experience."
"In LV, this is likely the best spot for Tea.\n\nAlthough a franchise,  I love the tea, no boba or other add ins.\n\nThe best thing: Osmanthus tea, half sweet.\n\nFriends liked the popcorn chicken, peach black tea, and Matcha milk tea with green tea ice cream.\n\nBathrooms aren't very clean (separate for men and women)  Cash and credit card accepted.   \n\nAm definitely coming back! Love!"
"Ordered a suggested combo that had egg foo young, chow mein, and sweet and sour pork. It was a good amount of good food for a decent price.  And whenever I eat Chinese I have to order the crab and cheese wontons, its my addiction.  Good quantity compared to other places (10 pieces).  I wish they had a little more filling, but that is my usual wish when I order wontons at most places.  My friend ordered the Bean Cake with Beef, which was also good.  Solid place to grab lunch in downtown Phoenix.  The restaurant/building does show its age compared to all the new places downtown.   I rounded up for the 4 star rating, its was better than okay, but would have to try again to be a fan."
"Absolutely AWESOME place to go for late night. Bar is great, and the menu for late night is fantastic. They literally have everything that you can imagine...I always get the psychedelic wrap with the portabella mushrooms. Wish that the fries were half off at late night too. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the wait is impossibly long at night...wish they were better with moving people along."
"From the first phone call through the service visit, these guys are professional, knowledgeable and trustworthy. DL was great! I hardly ever bother to write reviews, but this company stands out among others. Will not hesitate to use them again."
"We went here to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday, who said she wanted to go to a French restaurant.  I think there are few French restaurants in Pittsburgh, so this is one of the closest things/places we could find.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meals.  The atmosphere was fairly basic.   Service was good. They should take credit cards, for their own good, and their customers."
"I love this salon!  It's relaxed, comfortable, chic and incredibly friendly. My stylist Noah has been taking care of me for several years and has seen me through blonde, brunette and red and now back to blonde. My hair can be a challenge because it's fragile but I truly appreciate the fact he always takes the time to discuss my concerns, does not blow smoke up my rear, listens to my wants and dreams and guides me to the right direction.  It truly is a pleasure coming in and spending time in a beautiful space with a team of stylists who care for one another and a salon manager who makes sure I'm more than taken care of every single time and their use of Bumble & bumble products is a bonus because I love what B&b does for my hair and what Noah and his amazing team do for my ego."
"I've never had the burritos but what a great spot for a couple tacos. I stroll over from a neighboring residential building weekly for a fish taco and/or one of the others on the menu. It is quick and delicious. \n\nAs for the parking people mention, I walk, but there is the small lot connected to the building, a lot across the street with plenty of space (I think it is shared with Common Market) and plenty of street parking within a block or two in either direction. You can even park in the South BLVD street spots and walk across the light rail tracks and be here in no time."
"Tosh is was a DDD so we had high expectations and they came right through.  Our waitress was super cool, food was great turkey Tom and the wife had roasted pork with stuffing, only cow that was good.  We got stuffed so we could not have any of those divine desserts in the case, all made on premises.  We'll probably go back today to par-take.  Worth the trip and scarf it down!!!"
"I love all of Colleen's Consignment stores. \nIf we are looking for furniture, we always start here.  \n\nBecause of the nature of the store, and the type of business, you need to go and check stuff out every few weeks. And if you see something you like, speak up! I found stool I likes, browsed the showroom and when I went to grab it....it was sold! My fault!\n\nFun store with a fantastic staff!\nWorth checking out!"
Never been disappointed by the food at the roasting company. I would say they use high quality ingredients and it's always super tasty. Prices are reasonable for the quality! We go whenever we're in the SouthPark area.
"The place to be if you need to buy your costume early; that is, if you are between here, Party City, and the Halloween City across the path, then you're probably going to find the costume you need at this time of year.\n\nEven mid-September, they are faithfully stocked with everything you can require for"
"Very tasty and good prices on the buffet.  The only tiny drawback is the mazelike path to the restroom, but I didn't come for the potty, I came for the samosa!  Bring it on!"
This is what a bar is all about.  Come as you are.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  The people are down-to-Earth and very friendly.  Bathrooms were very clean and everyone was having a good time.  Live Music was playing and drinks were cheap.   If you're looking for a good time without all the glitz/glam and snooties...this is the place.
"Well, Yelp has yet to fail me.  The pumpkin bread is as amazing as everyone says.  I had the lox omelet and it was delicious. Biscuits and gravy were to salty for my liking.  Definitely will be returning here the next time in Vegas"
"this place is great , the ambience , the food , the service is usually pretty good . I love this place , one of the best fish and chips I ever have had but it was just a chef special one day and I have never seen it back on the menu (sad face) . I love the burger , the soups , the wine , I have had some great dinners here as well , the steak was fabulous . Its a great date place day or night !!!!"
"""Very fresh food, very clean restaurant, very friendly staff.  I was excited to get a chance to try a taco that was not as American as being \""""outside the bun\"""".   Delicious.  I can't have a taco from Taco Bell without thinking \""""It was SO much better at Baja\"""""""
"My coworkers and I order pizza here often.  We had delivery a few times and they're pretty quick.  Today we decided to carryout.   We ordered 2 classic pzone pizzas and 2 garlic butter dipping sauce for only $11.87.  It was ready within 20 minutes.  Upon arrival, I got confused as to which door to enter so I opened the delivery only door and immediately shut it and went to the door to the left.  That was the right door!  There were no signs telling me where the entrance was, so beware and read the signs.\n\nOverall, pzone was delicious!"
"Great food, especially for the price! A lot of filling cooked foods though so you end up getting full quickly. The sushi is not that good, but I can't really complain. They have delicious seaweed salad and I could go there just for that. Always the same food, but it's tasty."
"Oh Starbucks, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... This Starbucks is always busy enough to provide a nice vibe, but never over congested. The staff is always pleasant, and it's a great location."
"""It is a Trader Joe's - of course it is an awesome place! This particular location is my favorite. The sales staff are some of the person. I got person recommendations and help whenever I want, or can be left alone if that is your preference. The prices cannot be beat, and yeah, you can eat like crap anywhere, but this place helps me eat a lot cleaner. It also doesn't jack up the prices on healthy food like most retailers. I love that they will sample anything you ask about. The wine tastings are great, as is the sample station. It is our primary grocery store. My son has renamed it \""""The Sticker Store\"""" because the staff always hook him up with stickers at the check out.\nOur family staples are: Cheeses, Yogurts, Milks, Produce, Frozen Treats, the unique chocolate candies (chocolate covered edamame!), Frozen veggies and fruits, and breads."""
"I am a huge fan of the furniture selection that they carry. The showroom tends to show a more old fashion style. The catalogs that they carry will showcase a larger variety of different items. I ended up going through most of the Coaster and Homelegance collections to find a varied selection of items. \n\nSandy, the owner, is amazing. She sat with me and gave me a deal on everything I chose. I ended up leaving Hotai feeling like I got the best deal I could have. I set out a budget for all my furniture and did not reach the amount. I looked online afterwards to add up my coffee table, sectional sofa, dining room table, eight chairs, two nightstands, and a chest to find that it would have cost me more to purchase it all directly. \n\nIf you are a first time homeowner like I am, you will be in great hands."
"The chicken fried steak is so awesome, it's so huge and filling. Honestly I haven't tried anything else due the the great deal and the fact it's so much food. I come with a large group and it is still quick service and fresh food. I would recommend this to everyone."
"Though it's a little bit off the beaten path, this was one of the first restaurants I was taken to upon moving to Charlotte, which says a lot about it, I think. Smack dab in the middle of NoDa, CFT is worth checking out if only so that you have an excuse to check out the funky neighborhood its nestled in. \n\nBut the food and drink are worth it, too. As the name implies, try the fish tacos. My girlfriend's obsessed, and they're prepared the same way they are in Mexico--lightly battered, served with cilantro and all the fixins. Very fresh and very tasty, and not too expensive at all. The other food is standard mexican--nothing too transcendent, but it's all very good, too. I love the drinks here, and they sometimes have margarita specials which are worth checking out. \n\nAs for its environment, we love this place. It's small and intimate, so we love a date night here (clearly we're not alone). Definitely a good plan: go check out a gallery opening and eat here before or after. Or grab a romantic cocktail on your way home from some art-buying. Tres classy."
"I've been going to this Supercuts for a few months and Yanet is by far the best hair stylist there. Very friendly and sweet, and she does an amazing job. I always get a combover/slicked back kind of style and she is always amazing. If you ever go to this Supercuts request her and you'll be so glad you did!"
"I had two pairs of pants altered there -- one hem and the other, a hem and waist intake -- in November. She (or they?) does an excellent job. Alterations are never cheap, and I found her prices reasonable. (I brought my pants to her while visiting from New York, where alterations can be VERY costly.) I admired her work on a beautiful velvet men's jacket that a customer came in to try on and retrieve."
"Loves the recent Cezanne show. In fact I've seen it twice in the last week. I need to find out more about who curated the exhibit as it is very fine. The Oriental collection is very nice and soothing. \nThe Downtown Chamber Group gave a wonderful concert in the great hall on Sunday. I wonderful and unusual program of saxophone and harp. I think it is great to have music in the galleries. I liked the musicians being on a platform. since the room isn't banked one can see the performers.\nA few things I'm not so crazy about:\nThe great room is this awesome space for large art. Sunday I sat and looked at it for several hours. You know, not such great art. I find the Terrill boring and the other pieces uninteresting.\nThe cafe never quite lives up to its promise. My lunch companion barley touched her lunch and the waiter never asked why or offered a box.\nEnough grousing I love the place and go often."
"More like 3.5 stars. I do not go there often enough, but it is a little more than A-OK. I gave it the full 4 because the hot apple cider is that memorable.\n\n61C Cafe has  even 1-1 human-laptop ratio. Yes, the cafe may seem a little hipster (it is), a little grad school (it is), and a little granola (it is). But don't let stereotypes deter you; 61C is a pleasant experience.\n\nThe drinks I have had at 61C have been good, I might have had a better chai here or there, but overall I have left satisfied. I especially love late summer nights under the strung lights and people watching on Murray Avenue."
I go every time I need my haircut. Ever since moving to Pittsburgh I have been visiting the shop. \n\nThe atmosphere is great. Independently owned and you can tell by the family feel you get when you visit. \n\nBess cuts my hair and normally I just sit down and tell her to do whatever she wants. I have never been disappointed with a cut.
"Always great food and service! This place has looked the same ever since I was a kid. I actually don't think it has ever been remodeled! The old atmosphere is part of the experience. You won't find another place in Vegas like this. We went here today for Father's Day dinner and I always get the steaks which are delicious but I thought I would try something new. First, let me say the bread is the best here! It's cheesy toasted sourdough and I can eat 2 baskets myself. I ordered the Salmon with cajun seasoning and mixed Vegetables with a ranch dressing side salad. The fish was cooked well and not dry but it as very over seasoned. The seasoning is spicy and has good flavor and i'm sure it would be delicious if it was sprinkled instead of coated. I don't think I would order it again. After all it is a steak house and I will be sticking with the steaks in the future. My husband got the filet and as usual the filet was perfectly cooked and juicy. Everything else here is okay but the steaks is where it's at."
Good Fresh Bagels at Great Prices!\nTheir bagel sandwiches are also very good and at very reasonable prices. A dozen bagels there are HALF of what you pay at the Panera down the street.  Service is generally pretty good too.\n    It's nice to go into a place and get quality food without the feeling you're getting gouged on price and value.
Tatiana is the best! She takes her time and does a great job on a Brazilian Blowout! Great hair care that lasts for months!
"Step 1: Check the weather.  Make sure it's a nice, summery evening. \nStep 2: Arrive at PCaf with a large group of friends.\nStep 3: Sit out on the deck.\nStep 4: Order drinks and a heckload of wings.\nStep 5: GO TO TOWWWWWN."
I like this petsmart because they have the toys my dogs is always in need of. Sometimes you have to hunt for staff for check out but worth the wait.  I love being able to bring my dog in and try out in her things store.
"I've never lived in Madison, but as a visitor I've been to this place a half dozen times over the last few years, often when in town solo, and always have ended up having a good time.  5 stars for a bar with a great jukebox and friendly staff where even if you go alone you don't end up drinking alone- no attitude from the friendly, reasonably social fellow drinkers."
"After 5-6 visits to Osaka, I can say I'm pretty much a regular here...\nExcellent menu, delicious food and awesome late night specials (after 10 PM.) The staff is friendly.. However, the service could be better and faster"
"After a few failed attempts at other sushi restaurants ended up here as a last resort... I'm glad we came here food is amazing, fresh and delicious. Great customer service!"
"I love small businesses like this! I had been looking for a dentistry office in Madison and Dr. Hazen and the rest of his staff are awesome and so so helpful. Everyone is nice and treats you like a valued customer. I was in about a month ago for a regular check up and it was very thorough. The only thing that was kind of weird was the baking soda rinse...definitely something to get used to. Overall a great place to go, very happy with my choice!"
"The best Aesthetician EVER! Vonya will have you in and out of her waxing studio within 15 minutes for almost any combination of services. She's professional and manages to make you feel comfortable immediately (come on ladies, you know why this is important). I've been going to her for years, I would rather go au naturel than find a sub-par substitute."
"First Watch offers the standard American breakfasts.  It's good stuff.  What I noticed about this restaurant is the consumer service.  Albert's customer service skills are second to none.  Dude asked me what my name was, shook my hand and referred to me by my first name every time he came by to see how I was doing.  I recommend this restaurant."
"This is one of the best places for dancing in Madison.  From the few times i've been there, it's never been too crowded, but it's also never so empty that you feel like there's a spotlight on you.  It's usually at a good enough level where you have space to do your thang.  The music itself is interesting, as it's usually live DJs catering to a different theme every night.  I've heard several different types, such as house, latin, and juke.  It's a very refreshing change of pace from the usual top 40 or standard EDM you may hear at other bars.\n\nDrink wise, it's good.  Reasonably priced beers, and a small selection of specialty drinks to get you going as well.  The few i've had have been tasty.\n\nI don't have any valid complaints about this place.  Note though that if you aren't there to dance, then you're not likely to enjoy yourself.  It's what this place is built for."
"This place has the best selection of Halloween costumes locally. My only advice is to shop early. If you wait until the day before or the day of Halloween, you will want to pull your hair out. Their selection is NOT the cheapest, but there is plenty (if you are early).\n\nThroughout the year, they also have a lot of other decorations. I bought my New Year's Eve hats here and during summer, their luau decorations are spectacular!\n\nThere are a few other party places around town and I'm sure you can shop around when it comes to generic party supplies. Their mylar balloons are too expensive IMO, but I still really like this place.\n\n(10/16/10) I called beforehand for a bachelorette sash on a Saturday afternoon. I was on hold for 10 minutes before they told me they didn't have ONE sash in the entire store. If you are looking for something really specific, call first."
We stop in this place by accident and OMG.. Best chicken fried rice I have had since leaving NY.\nService and food is good.
"This place is outstanding. I couldn't be more  satisfied with the staff. I could say Lara, Jaylene among others go beyond their duty to serve."
I think this hospital AND the staff are GREAT. I live around here and have several family members who know and TRUST this hospital VERY MUCH
"My entire family has been going to Mr. Brakes for decades. It is hands down the best brake shop in Vegas. They are honest, their work is exemplary, they use the best parts, and their prices are great. No one else compares!"
"Wow! Been in here a couple times since moving nearby and everyone in the store are always very friendly and helpful.  Prices are good and they are very organized in making sure you get back all of  the items you drop off.  Turnaround time is decent and if you're in a pinch and need something sooner, they are willing to help you out."
"I am a Catholic and had no problem walking into this place!  Um, that is until I walked down the aisle and began to get that eerie feeling...like I was at a wake or something.  To be honest, it felt weird but I enjoyed myself.  The inside of the church was awesome...especially the tank setup at the altar and to the left of the aisle.\n\nI went to Church Brew Werks over the winter and do not remember what I ordered for dinner, but I do remember what I ordered to drink - STOUT!  I had two of them and my co-worker had the sampler along with some pale ale, I believe.  I remember the beer being outstanding.  So much so, I took a growler back to the hotel and put it into my luggage to bring back home with me..."
Yum yum yum. Hungry for Gyros? This is your place.
"If you want to get out of the city and go to a bar from a small town, here it is.  I like it right near the capitol."
"I love this place.  It is always busy, so you have to be patient, but it is worth it.  You get huge helpings and friendly service.  This is a no fuss kind of place, but try it, you will be hooked!"
"Las Vegas institution! My family has been here since the early seventies and all have been going here since it opened. There are many great ice cream places, some that I have reviewed, but my heart still belongs to Luv-it. Hate he drive to it, location has some issues, but all rewarded with the custard. Me, Scotch Jimmie, kids anything with chocolate, and my wife is the Western, thus reason for kids and the chocolate fixation. Great for moderate late night, pre 10pm Sunday - Thursday and pre 11 pm Friday and Saturday. Love that they are now open seven days, something that was not always the case."
"Best Thai I've had in the Mid-west. It reminded me a lot of the Thai that I have had in San Diego.  Very delicious.  They never asked me how spicy I wanted the food, but otherwise it was great.  The food wasn't too spicy though.  When I have Thai, I am always concerned about the heat.  \n\nThe Panang Curry was outstanding.  It had just the right amount of peanut sauce to coconut milk.  An\n\nThe restaurant is in a strip mall, but don't let the looks deter you.  The food is what you come for.  They give you a lot, so make sure that you have a big appitite or take some home. And as always the Thai Iced Tea is delicious."
"Its a Vegas landmark.   Really creamy, delicious and a variety of sundaes and toppings.  The only issue is they're very popular and sometimes theres a wait.   Adding something sugar free would rock too.  \n\nShe tells me it brings her back to custard she had growing up and its her favorite."
"Love this place!  The red curry is great,  as well as the mint pork. Yum! Their regular 1-10 spice level isn't THAT spicy so I usually get a 10 and it is just right.  The service is great,  maybe not overwhelmingly friendly but fine.  The interior is not what you would expect from the strip-mallish exterior as it is warm and inviting. Certainly a regular Thai stop."
"Stopped by this place for the first time in a while. They seem to be in the process of a lot of change, and from what I can see, it's good change! Their menu is a lot easier to understand ANDDD\n\nTHEY FINALLY TAKE CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS! \n(for orders over $5) \n\nBut hey, it's a start. Tried the Berry Berry smoothie (a new menu item..i think?) and it was so refreshing! Totally recommend it! Their boba was well-cooked as a I remembered from before too! \n\nIt was a bit expensive from what I saw though but worth it! The place overall seemed to be under a lot of construction. I don't remember a TV being there and the walls are covered in K-pop posters. If you're into that stuff, it'll be great for you!\n\nOverall, starting to get a better vibe and the food is good too!"
"""Wisconsin Craft Market has been causing quite a stir in the Midwest knitting blogs lately and as an avid knitter, I decided to make the 2+ hour trip from my hometown of Sheboygan, Wisconsin.  \n\nI have been knitting feline apparel for the last 28 years; coats, collars, dresses, mittens, hats, and capes are just a few of the products I create and donate to cat shelters across the country. \n\nUpon entering the market, a distinguished-looking man with a beard politely directed me to the store's yarn section, aptly named the \""""Wall of Cascade\"""". Now, I spent my youth living in a small Idaho town located in the Cascade range, and I must tell you; the plethora of colors in Wisconsin Craft's yarn section was reminiscent of my days spent in that beautiful mountain range. \n\nWell done, Wisconsin Craft Market! I applaud you on your excellent service and effervescent yarn collection. From now on, my 3 cats and the countless homeless felines across the country will be donning yarn and buttons sold from your charming establishment. \n\nHave a blessed day,\n\nKittyKnitter17"""
"Bill Spoon's BBQ is a small hole in the wall restaurant in Charlotte owned and operated by the Spoon's family.  I have actually been going here with my grandparents since I was 10 or 11 years old.  \n\nSpoon's has a small group of extremely loyal customers who have been visiting the location for several decades.  They retain customer loyalty not only because of the ridiculously tasty barbecue, but also because each member of the staff radiates a warm small town friendliness that makes each customer feel special and appreciated.\n\nThe barbecue itself is definitely the best that I have ever tasted.  They avoid using any heavy tomato based barbecue sauce.  Instead they blend peppers and spices into the pork and keep the meat its original color.  They offer their homemade barbecue sauce as a side item along with a homemade spicy vinegar creation that can be easily imitated but never duplicated.\n\nMake sure you stop by this place next time you are in Charlotte.  It is a one of the most popular small restaurants in town.  Spoon's is almost a local celebrity, who is always spoken about during conversations concerning great barbecue."
The most elaborate menu I've ever seen at a Vietnamese joint. \n\nI opted for the rare beef pho and was not disappointed. The noodle to beef portions was just about right and the broth was delishus. \n\nThe bowl of noodles was a little pricier than I'm use to but not by much.
"I adore Globe Salon. I have the privilege of knowing the owners, Stacy and James and they and their staff are delightful. Globe Salon is classy, hip, clean and a step above the rest. Take it from a female who for four years settled on mediocre, overpriced Vegas stylists. At Globe, you get what you pay for. They offer amazing facials, waxing and other exciting services and did I mention they are a Bumble and Bumble network salon? Huzzah! I love going here and I see either Sam or Megan. :-)"
"""At Med Grill you can BYO (save big $$ - couldn't say if there is a corking fee but if so it's like a buck or two). The Lamb shank is really good at Med Grill and I like the Kibe (baked and raw - did I spell \""""kibe\"""" correctly?). If you don't know what it is you should go and ask about it. Go raw for an adventure. When you go to Med Grill you descend stairs what appears to be like an underground office space (kind of weird) and surprise there is the Med Grill. No windows eww...but great service ...but  the decor is just ok... but I am giving it 4 stars mainly for the BYO and good food."""
"ate here twice in one weekend...\nonce for a catered dinner and once for sunday brunch.  unlike the masses, i preferred the former.  i could've eaten a whole plateful of the passed fig/cheese crostini apps.  the salad was perfectly dressed - slightly tart, completely delicious dressing.  i had one of the best catered vegi meals - mushrooms on top of polenta.  every bite was the perfect herbey blend without being over the top in salt or butter (as a lot of polenta dishes tend to be).  \ntake 2...brunch.  absolutely loved the atmosphere and mini pots of tea (green tea was excellent), however i think the overall selection was mediocre.  i guess i was hoping for some more savory dishes outside of the egg family since i normally avoid them.  i settled for the scrambler which again was mediocre.  the rosemary bread that came with it was quite delicious though.  all in all, i would totally recommend this adorable spot - great location by the capitol and quick service."
"I love this place.  Get there early because it can fill up by 1145am for lunch.  I don't understand the reviews that seem to view that as a negative towards the restaurant.\n\nWhen I worked downtown we used to go there once a month or so.  Now that I don't work there, I still make a pilgrimage a couple of times a year for the food.  \n\nService is always pleasant.  Yes, it's busy, but the staff always seems to handle it well.  \n\nLove their Gyros and Gyro Salads.  The french fries are also great.  Love, love LOVE Crazy Jim's!!!"
"We have been coming here now for about 2 yrs. An i have to say this place is great not only do all our clothes come out perfect every time, the service is impeccable. They're always nice and greet you with a smile and by name. It a family run businrss which gives it that specual touch as well an they take pride in their business. They have done hemming for me as well as sewing things that i have ripped  or snagged an it has always been perfect. They're very fast and get you in n out and they even have a drive up window if you're in a hurry and really don't have time to get out of the car. The prices are great and very reasonable. I highly recommend them for your dry cleaning needs. We have recently moved an it's a little drive to take our clothes but it's well worth it. Wouldn't go anywhere else..."
"""I have to agree with the other users; therefore, not too much more to add.\n\nLove the staff, they're really friendly. I also love the fact they carry items from the \""""Fred & Friends\"""" line.\n\nParking can be \""""interesting\"""", as they share a lot with Thai Taste.\n\nI'm happy to purchase things here, since it's a local business."""
"The staff is extremely professional and extremely friendly and helpful. I had my flowers re-delivered multiple times because the recipient was not present and they were great with their communication and customer service. Most importantly, the flowers turned out fantastic and everyone loved them.\n\nI highly recommend Tiger Lily!"
"I love luv-it.  My go to sundae is the western.  Lately I have branched out a bit and tried some of their flavors of the day.  I might just be used to my sundaes but I prefer them over a flavor of the day in a cone.  It is nice they offer different flavors though.  I will still give them a try from time to time.  There is almost always a line, even in the winter but there is plenty of people watching to do to pass the time.  I do wish they were open a little earlier but when I first started going they weren't open 7 days a week like they are now so I will take what I can get.  My fave downtown lunch is Viva Arepeas then dessert at Luv-It.  So good!  Oh yeah and make sure you bring cash, if you forget there is an atm in the mini mart next door."
"The staff is friendly and on top of their game. The food is so good, I want to move there just to be able to be a regular. I will be back."
"Great store, amazing deals. Always walkout spending too much money, but the savings are amazing. Dan is really helpful and has a great eye for style. The customer service is unmatched!"
"I LOVE Quiznos, a lot better than some other fast food sandwich places. I think the bread quality is better here and the ingredients are fresher. It just seems so much more convenient to me to order the sandwich from the menu and they prepare it for me. Then I add the extra jalapeno peppers and peppercinis. Also I'm a big fan of their honey mustard sauce."
"""In Pittsburgh, there are a ton of sub shops. This one however, is pretty good. They make pretty much all the \""""normal\"""" subs with a couple of speciality subs too. The fries here are particularly good, especially the sweet potato fries. Service is pretty quick but if you go later at night, it tends to get pretty busy. Overall, can't go wrong here for lunch or dinner."""
"Before I was vegetarian, I visited Cedarland at least once a week for their Shawarma Baladi.  Wow.  That was one great sandwich.  One I definitely recommend to you meat eaters out there!\n\nI'm not a big fan of their falafel or their stuffed grape leaves (I much prefer Middle East Deli which I think changed it's name last year for both of these items).\n\nHowever, I do prefer Cedarland for their turkish coffee.  I've had it all over Charlotte, and I do believe it's my favorite here.  I always get a whole pot for the best taste.\n\nI also love shopping in the grocery store for various items!  And the olives here are super cheap and delicious!"
"""I love Capriotti's.  This is by far my favorite place to eat in Law Vegas.  Yes, this $7-8 sandwich tops the much more expensive food you can get at the buffets or other fancy joints in town.  The turkey sandwiches are made with real turkey, as in thanksgiving turkey not lunch meat slices.  The \""""bobby\"""" is their most popular sandwich, which is like a thanksgiving leftovers orgy with turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  Personally, my favorite is the \""""plain\"""" turkey sandwich with sweet peppers, hot peppers, and pickles.\n\nMy only complaint about Capriotti's is that they serve Pepsi, but I guess no one is perfect."""
"This place is amazing! Every single time I come here I am never disappointed. Not only do you get what you pay for, plus more, it is really good food! The menu may seem like any other place with the items listed, but they bring something special to the table every time. The area is a little weird & parking isn't ideal, but with the service / food, I don't mind a bit!"
"Burgers are one of those things that have branched out into several sub-genres. The Original Hamburger Works sticks with the classic, hand-shaped and flame broiled. Yes, much like you'd make at home. \n\nThis isn't a fast food burger. This isn't a gourmet burger. This is a BURGER. And a burger place that you want to eat at. \n\nThe chili cheese fries are sick. In a good way. Love it!"
"Mmmmmm I make a visit here for my Chinese cravings when I am in need of a mouth orgasm. They give it to me fresh, clean, and generous in which I always leave filled up just how I like.\n\nI tried the general so chicken on this last visit and boy I was in a sea of bliss with this delicious dish!\n\nI have been craving it since, I dream of it, I need it, I want it more and more.\n\n\nI have 12 check ins at Golden Flower and every single dish I try is just as Amazing. The staff is Fantastic, the food is top quality and the prices are low for the giant portions.\n\nTheir war wonton soup is a delicious meal in itself as well for those cold nights! It is full to the brim with shrimp, bbq pork, chicken, veggies and wontons! A must try!"
"""The prices are decent; the drink selection is good; and the burgers are surprisingly good (one of the only places in Oakland that can consistently get \""""medium rare\"""" right)."""
Great looking gallery and customer service.  The frame and mat choices were overwhelming but the girl (Stacy?) was really helpful.  The finished piece looks better than I imagined on the magnetic display they use.  I have recommended and will be back again after my trip.
"I like to stop in Marshall's from time to time.  This one is conveniently located when I am on N. Tryon Street.  The store has shoes, clothing, luggage, adult and children's clothing.  If you need it, you can usually find it at Marshalls, which is affiliated with TJ Maxx.  No wonder I like this store!  I especially like to peruse the housewares and discounted sections of the store.  And you should know that I must at least walk through some purses (none bought during this trip...phew!).  I love purses, purses, and more purses.  For some reason, the ones I touch are always the priciest! \n\nNote:  Traffic in this area of N. Tryon St. is horrendous during the holidays."
I always get boba here when I visit LV.  The service is fast and friendly.  The shop is clean with a ver hip feeling.  But the main reason I come here is the boba is always fresh and the perfect consistency of chewiness!
"Tends to be a meeting spot whenever I'm in the northwest. Solid bar food, plus the only place I know of that has walleye. Their brews are pretty good, but if it's war dog season, order no less than three. Then a growler of it to go, it's liquid gold. Fun times at their mini brew festivals as well, held every few months."
"Linda, Tammy & the rest of the staff are so sweet & gentle. The office uses the latest technology, does everything in-house, and they take most insurance carriers! I'm sending my entire family to Dr. Earl!"
"Rarely do I visit this store but I find time when they're having a great sale.  I do however love shopping for shoes on their website and I've had nothing but great experiences in store and online, they are all about personal one on one service and very serious about pleasing their customers."
"This is a great Chinese restaurant, and not only in contrast to the previous establishment (of the same name).\n\nHow Lee has both a standard American-Chinese menu and a Schezuan menu. The American menu is great; the dishes are well made, with good ingredients and of nice portion size. I should say that I did find their hot'n sour not as good as Zaw's (bear in mind though that this should be a leftovers soup with maybe interesting flavors over time; How Lee seems to make it from scratch).\n\nThe Schezuan menu is fabulous; I'm still working my way through it. My only comment is that these dishes can be very hot, so know what you're getting yourself into as you order.\n\nI've never had any unpleasant interactions with the staff. As in all such things: treat them nice and they will treat you nice.\n\nOne warning: If you order delivery the restaurant adds a steep surcharge (not noted on the flyers). So, eat out or do pick-up."
"gotta love their chicken wings. Mmmmm!!! going to this hooters your going to have to wait in line, but no problem for me, probably be waiting for less than 20 min. The servers that we have been getting, have been attentive and nice. Get's kinda loud here, but's it's all in the fun of sports, drinking, and chicken wings! The original and spicy are my favorite."
Excellent prices. Decent food. Nice staff. Clean and friendly.
"I am a fan of Halo Piercing.  I have had 3 piercings over the last 10 years and 2 of the 3 have been at Halo.  Had I know about Halo earlier in life I would have got my 1st one there too.  \n\nThe staff was very professional.  They talked me through the whole thing, step by step. The inside of Halo is cleaner than most doctor's offices and they take pride in their line of work.  \n\nThe only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they do not pierce anyone under 18 years old.  This is unfortunate as I called Halo piercing to pierce my 3 year old daughters ears.  I asked if they would do it if I brought in my drivers license and her birth certificate so they would know I was her mother, and they still said no.  \n\nI hope that one day they change this policy.  But, I can also respect their professionalism.  I know when my daughter is 14, and goes into Halo to get pierced, they wont do it.   And, that is comforting."
"I'm not sure I can say much that every other person here hasn't! \n\nThis library is pretty darn perfect. \n\nIt's comfy. It has beautiful architecture. It's really fun just walking around browsing different sections inside the library. And you can find everything from a cafe to reading rooms hidden in this spacious building; I've been coming here on a regular basis for six years and I'm still discovering new nooks and crannies in this place! Haven't seen the ghost that supposedly haunts the lower levels yet, though...\n\nAnd the resources are splendid - the librarians can help you with research, there are staff members who can work with people who need help finding jobs, and the library also offers numerous lectures and classes on a regular basis which are usually free. I'm currently enrolled in Spanish and Japanese classes, which didn't cost me a dime.\n\nPittsburgh's library system overall is absolutely wonderful, but out of all of our libraries, this is the one you need to visit at least once - just to see it and experience the glory that is the main hub of the Carnegie Library system."
"Loved it,small intimate, food very good, desert nummy!"
"""A Restored Mill in South End, with lots of Character!  Salons, Restaurants, Shopping and sometimes a \""""Market\"""", sometimes an Art Show!

"Joe Craig and the other stylists at Salon Botanical offer old fashioned customer service in a modern salon. I've been a client for ten years, and would not think of going anywhere else. Mui's manicures are the best I've ever had. -Great Dilworth location!"
I love Volcano Tea. There is a place I think is better but volcano has the variety and right price. All of their drinks are good. They use some fresh ingredients and their boba is good. They take cards now.
"PIES, PIES, PIES. If you love PIES, only at this location and another location that they distribute to will you enjoy the best, especially PUMPKIN! I odered online and they tried to contact me to let me know they sold out. When I got there, they quickly apologized and took care of me for the next day. YUMMY."
"Yelp does it again. Found this gem and have to add my five stars. Fresh sushi, great staff, wonderful service, and totally random location. If you aren't pretentious and have to be seen on the strip, go here and enjoy. Ask the servers for their recs on rolls."
"I have been going to Studio 924 for a couple years now. Everyone is friendly. The cuts and colors I have gotten have been perfect. I have been to several salons in Madison and this one is the best for customer service, friendliness and quality of the product."
"Pricey, high class, good quality food! Not too pricey though. You get what you pay for. I tried the Small Plate Sampler appetizer and Filet Mignon for my lunch. The food is rich in taste, very delicious. Service is quick and very friendly. The place is crowded for a reason. Interior is very clean, cozy, warm, and a bit dim. Easy to find. There's absolutely nothing to complain about but lots to remember as you leave the place."
"Outstanding customer service, super friendly and very welcoming! Nate was our bartender and did a great job taking care of us. Honestly, it was super dead in the Ox when we were there but the staff was fantastic and we'll definitely be going back in the future. Great locals watering hole."
"My daughter has taken lesson here for 2 years.  Miss Nancy is wonderful and caring, and the staff truly dedicates themselves to the children.  My daughter has some range of motion issues, and both the instructors she has worked with have taken their time with her to make sure that she advances along with the rest of the class."
"""I've been in a sandwich/sub mood for lunch the last few months. I've been to Calabria a few times now and have been ordering the Italian sub with everything- great sandwhich!!\n\nThe location and \""""dining\"""" area is a bit rough- but get over that and enjoy a nice meal."""
Get the fattoush with chicken!!! \n\nI have now been to this eatery a total of 4 times and I have enjoyed each and every visit.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the safhi that I had ordered as an appetizer the meat was a little dry. It still tasted wonderful but the meat seemed like it was reheated....\n\nGreat trendy atmosphere and heala good food yumm-o\n\nThe vegetable salata at Aladdin's is to die for.
Carb/cholesterol savor...chicken fajitas with no tortillas...Yummy!!!
"""Ok, I know Panera is a chain restaurant, but I still like it. Especially on a hot day like today, a \""""You Pick Two\"""" seems like a winner. I'm a HUGE fan of the You Pick Two and since I am pretty mundane when it comes to sandwiches....I always order the Sierra Turkey with no Onions and possibly the Mac and Cheese, Broccoli Cheddar Soup or the Chicken Noodle Soup. The bread is always soft and there is plenty of turkey in the sandwich to make me feel like I'm fully satisfied. Overall, Panera is one of my favorite lunch joints to go to."""
"Best persian food ever.\nWOW!\n\nPossibly the BEST Persian food I've EVER had.\nTheir kabab Bargs are to die for.  LITERALLY! \nWe ordered sabzi plate , Mast Musir ,Salad shirazi with the bread as appetizer.OMG!\n\nAfter the first bite, my face was like a cartoon; my jaw dropped, my tongue rolled out, and I was salivating.  Seriously, it's just that good.\n\nI really really recommend this place .l 5 diamond Star"
The loft like layouts and the amount of light my unit had was why I moved there. Unlike any other place I've seen in Vegas St. Clairs would be the only place in NV I would call home again. The pool and gym were all top notch.
"This place is a must eat! I didn't expect a place like this to be in Vegas, I felt like I was on a small town ranch. The meat was perfectly smoked and tender and full of flavor! The portions are huge and inexpensive."
"We've been coming here since it was a little hole-in-the-wall. It's awesome. About the best Thai food in Vegas. Chicken Satay is great. Tom Ka Kai soup is wonderful. All the noodle dishes are great as are the curry entrees. The only complaint is that it's always busy and every once in awhile the service is a bit spotty. Overall, great!"
I love the jerk chicken and pork. The meat just comes off the bone. The plantanes were superb but be careful with the dipping sauce--SPICY! D\u00e9cor is a lot of local flavor.
"""There aren't many Cajun restaurants in the area to compete w/ Razoo's.  However, this place won't disappoint! If you like spicy food you will enjoy eating here. They serve 'Nawlins style food including fish, chicken, and crawdads/crayfish. This is only place in the area that I know of that serves crawfish. If you aren't a fan of seafood, the menu is big enough to accommodate your tastes. \n\nAdditionally, the drinks here are great. Sometimes, my friend and I come here on Friday nights just for a drink or two. I love their frozen \""""Mardi-rita\"""" and potent \""""Worm Burner.\""""\n\nThe service is good/average and the decor is colorful, as the theme is Mardi Gras-esque."""
"I love great Asian places with reasonably priced noodle dishes. This is one such place. Flavorful, varied menu, nice atmosphere, good service. The strip-mall location is a little devoid of character, but it's a great place."
"What a wonderful museum! I especially liked the modern art area. Went with 2 adults, a 9 and 4 year old and 3 month old. In many museums this would be frowned upon especially by other patrons but we were pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, the kids area was closed the day we were there. Thank goodness they were all quite happy to check out the other exhibits! We only made it through about half of them before deciding that it would be best for us to leave the others for another visit. Loved the courtyard outside and would love to go back sans kids for a meal at the cafe. It will likely be a while before that happens because EVERYDAY the kids ask when we're going back!"
"I came here for restaurant week and it was my first experience here. It's a pretty small, romantic feeling place that's great for dates. The appetizer, pasta, meat, and dessert were all so good. I was very satisfied. I want to come back and try some of their dishes on their regular menu. It's pretty difficult to find parking. It is easier during a snowy winter, but I'm not sure if I even want to try to find parking around there during nicer seasons."
Top notch service that never ended. The employees were professional and friendly. Rooms were nice and clean. Very accommodating.
"As a bonafide movie geek and serious cinema collector, I'm so happy that we have a shop like this in town. While the inventory has gown downhill in recent years, I'm glad they have been able to stay open. The vintage posters sold on consignment are cool (though that rare Revenge of the Jedi one sheet has been in there for years now) but the new posters are mostly reprints. If you need help tracking down an original poster, the owners are glad to help. The 5x7 and 8x10 photos are mostly reprints (and poor, blurry reprints at that). Some decent lobby cards but most of them aren't really worth buying. I still like this shop and I encourage all movie buffs to stop in and buy something; let's keep them open!"
"""If you want good Chinese food served in a nice restaurant with good service this is the place to go off the Strip.  Try the clay pot dishes, chow fun, Peking duck, scallops in black bean sauce or any seafood dish and you can't go wrong.  Service can be inconsistent but the food is \""""dynomite.\""""  Open late for those of use who get the munchies."""
"Menu looks awesome! Tuesdays there is $5 wines and kids eat free. Has a funky smell, but it's minor and the place is old. Parking in front is tricky, but plenty of parking in the back. Menu is great for large crowds and plenty of seating throughout. Salmon wrap was just okay, but black and blue burger was amazing!! Kinda divey, but I like it. Seat yourself."
"Dr. Smooke and his staff are amazing! They are so kind. Dr. Smooke is great, he really works with you. I never had a problem with making an appointment, and would sometimes walk in. I defiantly recommend Dr. Smooke to anyone who needs a great chiropractor."
"""*UPDATE*\nThey got a new pastry chef in there that makes the most awesome cupcakes! Oh yeah, do yourself a favor and try the Red Velvet Cupcake.. killer, seriously! \n\nThe first time I tried Willo many years back I was unimpressed as the bread was to doughy and heavy for my tastes. Well I recently tried Willo after having a horrible \""""funky monkey\"""" and cibatta from another local bakery. This place has SO improved!

"Support your local businesses! With that said, this little pizza shop is close to home. The owner knows me by order. He always greets with kindness and offers me something for free cause hes nice. I've ordered quite a bit from here. Can't go wrong with wings. Chicken Fingers are huge. This one of those places that has awesome ranch! no serious! I usually get a personal pie with an order of wings with fries and it's less then $15. With Pizza Hut and Dominos near by...you just can't get that there. And they taste better than the chains. Go there! For real!"
My husband I go here at least once a week and we went on Fathers Day. Was surprised they raised the price and still had the same food they always do.  It was still awesome though. the best part is you get to eat all the sushi you want.
"Nothing better than a big bowl of soup!!!! And I have tried the pho in lots of Vietnamese restaurants.  Best ever here . After your first visit, you become family and if you don't remember what you liked, they do.  It's a rainy day MUST !"
"Like having our own little MoMA on State Street! I'm addicted to the inventive, original merchandise. Definitely the gen-X/Y gift-shopper's classier alternative to Archie McFee -you'll find less cheap plastic crap and instead books, toys, bags, clocks, dishes, office supplies, cards, gifts, and gadgets aimed towards the more cerebral of pop-culturists. Great for shopping; fantastic for browsing. It feels like you're in a gift shop run by the spawn of MacGuyver and Yoshitoma Nara."
"Girlfriend and I decided to give this pub a shot.  We drove right past it the first time, as there really is no sign.  We entered the restaurant side and were the only ones there.  The bar must be great, because that side was pretty full.  Our waiter was fast and the food was great.  I will go again when we're cruising this part of town again."
"No Wonder these guys have such high ratings. These guys are awesome when it comes to knowing their stuff and helping you out with some information on discounts and ways to save. My bf and I were in the store the other day and it was the cashier and another customer. We came and got some information on what else to do to our pool to keep the alkalinity/ph etc all balanced. But what we really got was..... information about a 50 rebate through SNWA that you can apply to a solar pool cover. Also... through May 11, there is 15% off the solar covers in the store and additionally...... they have military discount. Total, my solar cover will be about 65.00 - SCHWEET!!\nWe visit these stores all over the area in our shopping adventures but this one and the Southern Highlands one are the ones we frequent most as they are the most helpful and haven't steered us wrong yet."
"I don't know of a better place in Charlotte to get a sandwich or a wrap.  This one for me is an A+.  I've recently introduced (hooked) about 10 people at work onto Laurel Market.  It's at least a 45 minute round trip for us to go for lunch (takeout) but it's worth the time/gas!  So far, my favorite and the crowd favorite is the #4.  Most of us get it on a Spinach or Tomato Basil wrap.  It's incredible!  Turkey/Pepperjack/LTO/Bacon/Chipotle spread... unbeatable."
"""A Charlotte gem. Walking into Paper Skyscraper, you feel like you're in a small town card and gift store, except not. PS is classy. This hot little shop has a complete library of new and classic books, knick knacks, the best card selection you will find in town, and great paper to wrap your gifts (even the ones you buy for yourself because you will find something for yourself here among the toys, jewelry, kitchen items, chocolates, journals, etc...). Plus, there's a naughty little section with wonderful scented massage oils and other \""""behind closed door\"""" activities. One warning, don't expect to be in and out--I often find hours disappear as I wonder through."""
Love this place! Good prices! The food is really good and the portions are huge. Average diner comfort food done well. The owners are Greek so they know what's up! I've had breakfast (best pecan waffles in CLT) lunch (steak salad comes with fries on it) and dinner (meatball sub is authentic as it gets). Their only downfall is they don't handle volume well and the staff gets stressed. You can wait awhile for drink refills and the check if they are busy. The food is worth it!
"I have to say, this has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Chambana.  I've only visited for lunch and although their dinner menu looks good, I haven't made a trip to try.  I have always had great service and the food has always been wonderful.  \n\nThe only time I haven't been completely pleased was with the Farro salad which came with veggies, but there were only two quarter pieces of zucchini and two 1-inch slices of asparagus.  \n\nThis place is now my go-to restaurant for lunch because of the extensive burger and sandwich menu.  They have great sides and the prices are great for the quality of food and creativity."
The best vets ever!!!   We have 3 dogs.  These guys make you feel each pet is the most important ever.  The vets will always call you at home on their cell phones to follow up and check on your animal.  The staff is sweet and very accommodating.  They are building a new facility to open in the fall downtown Matthews.  Anyone new to Charlotte/Matthew/Weddington area -- this is the vet for you.   Always caring.
Omg it was sooooooooooooo good u gotta hug the chef I went on my day best steak Burger
"""This is a self-described \""""hippie store,\"""" and it delivers the goods. Bumper stickers galore, band t-shirts in spades, and a fine selection of blown glass in the back.

It's a must shop if you're a bleeding heart, and you should stop in even if you're not...just for kicks and/or a heart attack. Then you'd be bleeding heart though...\n\nTheir website is actually really good for an Indy place like this, as is their Facebook page."""
OMG thats all I am going to say about this place! Totally worth every penny and worth breaking your diet for! Move over Krispy Kreme and Dunkin!
Great shop! Excellent customer service.
"We came to get a taste of AZ and we totally got it here. Friendly locals that dance awesome, way cheap happy hour and a fun atmosphere that never let the party die.\n\nWe came in on a SAT, got to join at some line dancing classes lol.... THAT was fun... we sucked but it was still FUN!!!  Everyone was really nice and welcoming. \n\nI think we spent a total of like 60 bucks this night and got HAMMERED, danced like crazy, and even got to eat tacos from a taco truck next door!  \n\n\n\nIgnore the bad comments. We did our research on local bars, we wanted a place that did NOT feel like LA or any other big city copyKat. This place did the job.\n\nAll the other bars nearby reminded us of every other bar we normally go to in LA, and lets face it, if its nice fancy bars that you seek, with a lot of pretty people posing, cocky attitude and want to pay a nice penny for drinks.... we have the best in WEHO.  =) \n\n\n\n\nIF we come back to AZ again... we'll for sure come back again!"
"Absolutely the kindest staff and quick good service.  They saw me coming with a stroller and rushed to get the door, very kind and friendly!"
"This is my favorite Chinese place here in Madison. My sister told me about this place but never went til about 4 years ago. We don't go there very often but they always remember us. The wait staff is very friendly,which I have never experienced in a Chinese restaurant ever. They know customer service to the T. I never have to ask for anything. The tea cup is always full. Service is prompt and quick with a smile. Food is the BEST. Take out is very quick too."
"i LOVE this place!  Emily J. rocks!  Nice building, relaxing environment, and very professional.  Great prices for their services!  I've only gotten haircuts (around $25) and partial highlights (around $65) here, but now i won't go anywhere else."
"Not the largest selection, but what they have is great. Beautiful and interesting choices.  I'm always tempted by several of their fabrics. Every time I've been there, the service has been perfect. I've been asked if I needed help within moments of walking into the store, and I've had my fabrics cut out and purchases rung up very quickly."
"Big Jim's is something from the past, if you are looking for those Pittsburgh restaurants from yesteryear then you are in luck with Big Jim's.  The gf and I went here for Dinner one night on a Monday at 6pm and this place was packed.  She got the reuben, which had homemade russian dressing made with bread & butter pickles, (not my cup of tea), but still very tasty.  I indulged in the chicken parm sandwich, which I found out later that the veal parm is the way to go, but nonetheless the chicken parm sammy was very good.  We also had onion rings, which were run of the mill.  But all in all for two gigantic sandwiches, onion rings and 3 beers for under $30 is a great deal."
"I've been playing for a few sessions now and love it here. I'm on a social league and the refs call the games as such, which is nice to see. They are fair and friendly. Turf is in good shape. Win or lose, my team is known to stay after for some delicious beer and popcorn."
"What a nice place to stop for a cup of java, tea, or other similar concoction.  I love the atmosphere...everyone is on a laptop or iPad.  I didn't hear too much conversation (except at my table).  There were plenty of customers in the establishment yet there were plenty of tables available.  A nice spot.  I look forward to trying the other location and hope it is as comfortable as University."
"One of my Favorites in Pittsburgh.  The pasta and salads are excellent, the baked ziti is my favorite.  Service can be a little sketchy at times, but other than that, love this place."
"Yes, I just gave this donut house a five star rating.  Winchell's is benefiting from the wave of nostalgia that came over me when I walked in with my pal Matt after dinner at Wendy's Noodle House.  It was already 8:30pm, but the cases were FULL of fresh donuts.  I remember having Winchell's all the time when I was growing up in SoCal and they were everywhere.  I'm sure I've driven by this one, but never stopped in until tonight.  Matt told me they're open 24 hours, too--curses!  I don't need to know that.  He's just paying me back for telling him that Keebler Grasshopper cookies are the same thing as the Girl Scouts' Thin Mints and can be had year-round.  Now we're even.  Four donuts for $2.99 cannot be beat and the memories that Winchell's brings back are priceless."
"I have come here twice while visiting Madison and I must say my girlfriend and I love it. The line can seem intimidating at times but tables flip fast and the line out the door can turn out to be only 15 minutes worth of a wait. The scrambler is excellent, any pancake or French toast dish is to die for and the omelets are always delicious. Do yourself a favor and get your butt down to marigold kitchen for breakfast brunch or even lunch. You will not be disappointed."
I put it out on Twitter that I was in search of succulents & a friend pointed me towards Campbell's.  Everyone who worked there was extremely friendly & even went into the back to get fresher moss than what they had out because I had mentioned I was using it for a photoshoot & he wanted to give me the nicest looking moss he had.  \n\nI will definitely come back when the weather gets warm enough to plant.
"I have been trusting Thrifty Cleaners with all of my dry cleaning ever since they opened.  I always have wonderful results from them and my clothes still look as if I just brought them home from the store.  The owners are incredibly nice and honest.  If you are looking for a great dry cleaner with great rates and fantastic results, look no further.  Thank you Thrifty Cleaners!"
"Pewter Rose is the perfect place to go for an upscale brunch in South End. I'm still craving the bananas foster french toast I had for brunch. Before our meals, the friendly waitress brought us delicious butterscotch scones. The whimsical decor is beautiful, with sculpted trees by artist Jared Nicholson. I'll have to try Pewter Rose for a romantic dinner next. \n\nI should mention that the first time I tried to go here for brunch, they were closed for a private wedding party. That happens, of course, but the staff was pretty rude to me when explaining this."
Really fabulous sushi!  Hotel told me to go to nakama which I did.  It's a bar that serves sushi not a sushi bar.  I got in a cab and went to kiko.  While it is not the prettiest place I ha e ever been the sushi was fantastic.  Sushi chef was com Tokyo and been doing this for 25 years. He made me an unbelievable Sardine.  I wasn't sure I would like it and he had me try it and said if I didn't line he wouldn't charge me.  I loved it and ordered another.  Tuna was super fresh and the scallop was also fresh and served in the shell as sashimi.  The salmon skin hand roll was also great.\n\nwant to add that most true sushi eaters would never order a spider roll with spicy mayo.
"I have been here countless times and have never been disappointed. They also have prompt delivery for those campus dwellers who are sans car. Everything here is delightful and amazing.  For vegetarians this menu is daunting. (So many options, but almost all menu items have a seafood, chicken, or beef/pork option.)"
"Near Bacon Street (Yes, there is a Bacon Street!) in Waunakee, this is the gas station we always use to fill up on our way to and from Sauk City. It's clean and you can buy cheap bananas here."
I agree with someone else who reviewed this dry cleaners. Grace is a real sweetheart.  She takes personal pride in the work. I can't recommend  more!
"I cannot say enough good things about Halo. This is absolutely the most professional and cleanest shop I've been to in Arizona. They have a great selection of jewelry a little on the pricey side but that's what you pay for retail. Jeremiah was our piercer and not only was he super professional and awesome at what he does, he was a great guy to work with--hilariously funny and very personable. If you are looking to get another piercing or perhaps take your child in to get her first, this is the place to go. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and it's not one of those weird trendy places where you go in and feel uncomfortable. Everyone and anyone is made to feel welcome here. And for the teenage crowd remember at Halo you get 3 free piercings on your 18th birthday."
I love this place so much. Their rice is a thing of beauty. I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience. It's very small but there always seems to be a clean table available. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Food is consistently delicious and my husband loves their baklava.
"Some of the best sushi I've ever had....and I come from the East Coast.  Unreal toro, have some of it's available."
Classic feeling southern food. I enjoyed my chicken and dumplings more than most places.... take that Cracker Barrel!
"Favorite Thai in TOWN.   I know this could be argued, but I will say this....its fresh, balanced, fast, cheap, and they have several locations.  They know what they are doing here, its a winning combination at Pin Kaow, lunch or dinner its packed and thats a sign of success.  10 star Thai!"
Wow!  Best Pho in Phoenix for sure. Broth is so intensely flavored I hardly had to or wanted to add anything to it. Also the best service we have had anywhere at any restaurant in ages. Super friendly and boxed our pho for us!  Also brought out cut chilled noodles for our baby. So impressed!
"If you ever want a good plate of asparagus, this is the place. It had a slight crunch, but was fully cooked, the sauce is like heaven, and the proscuitto is perfection. Had a cup of French onion soup, which was tasty, and crab cake on the way. Amazing. Bon appetit"
"Came during my lunch break from near by CSN. I was craving something light and not expensive. I came in and it was a very cute spot--very mom and pop. \n\nI sat down and was given water immediately and a menu. I had their Prik King chicken dish with a side of soup.\n\nWhen I got the soup first it was pretty tasty and so I ate it with a quickness. After, I got my Prik king and I was a fan on the first bite. The chicken was well cooked and the sauce was well done--not too salty and oily. The rice made is good compliment to the dish as many Asian dishes.\n\nI would come again."
Food always good. Service is always fast and friendly. Prices are inexpensive.
"I stopped by after a craving for pizza overwhelmed me. There is a very nice priced lunch special for a 2 topping personal pizza and drink. I added some Detroit Red Wings to my order. I am pretty new to the Vegas area and have been searching for a good chicken wing. I've tried several local bars and what not, but I think I have found my wing! NN has a extra crunchy fried wing not tossed in some dreadful wing sauce, which makes it perfect if you like naked wings. The pizza is good as well, but there was a slight sour taste that did not sit well with me. I got the same off putting taste at another local establishment. My taste buds could be off, I'm not sure. Menu taken with, I will return. I am not a Detroit or Michigan anything fan but, the place has a true oldschool sports bar feel. Enjoy the sounds of the 60's playing in the background."
"""best wonton soup in the city.  amazing egg rolls.  sweet aquarium up front.  delicious broccoli with garlic sauce (don't judge me for ordering this).  i will always say \""""yes\"""" to coming here!!!  \n\nparking can be a bitch, but you're downtown -- so it's no surprise/fault of chinatown inn."""
"""I love these hot sandwiches. It is a big rtion that I can rarely finish in one sitting. If you eat in, you also get fries for free.\n\nThe service is pretty quick, although they do get quite busy at lunch time. The sandwiches come out hot and to order. I usually get the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak with L,T,M,O and always enjoy it. They also offer adding an egg, which can be yummy.\n\nHighly recommend for a delicious hot sandwich at lunch or dinner.\n\nNegatives:\n- The restaurant itself looks kinda run-down from the furniture, to the floors, to the poor lighting. Although they seem to be going for an \""""old\"""" look, it could really use a facelift.\n\n- They only take CASH. They have a ATM-like machine to get cash, but it will charge you for the transaction.\n\n- Wish they were open late!"""
Drew at VW service at O'Brien always has my best interest at heart and does great follow up - pleasure to work with a truly professional organization
"As a LA native I have had the famous Roscoes chicken & waffles, this is BETTER.  I never thought I would ever say that.  Every time I come here we come in a big group, they are really accommodating and quick with the food.  The servers are really friendly and they have kool-aid on tap, if you're a fan.  The chicken is delicious, perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried, and perfectly juicy! The waffle was not soggy and compliments the chicken well.  The mac and cheese is so good.  Be ready to be so full you can't breathe though! Big portions and super heavy.  Its a must try if you are ever in Phoenix!"
They took great care of my car. The exhaust sounds amazing and even performs a hell of a lot better
"This place is much better than that other pancake chain, IMO.  What you really want to order is the Swedish pancakes.  They are nice and thin with good texture, and the lingonberry sauce is yummy.  The plate of three is not a super-heavy meal and goes nicely with a side of bacon.  As for the rest of it, well, it's breakfast food classic style.  Not a lot of worldly innovation, but it's all good.  Plus they are open at the crack of dawn."
"Amy's Cafe is an excellent spot for lunch.  In college I lived across the street and had to stop there every other day.  Soup, salad and baguette is my favorite.  Their greek salads are excellent, the brocolli cheese soup very good, and who doesn't love baguettes.  Try the soup in a bread bowl as well.  Perfect spot for a light lunch.  Biggest drawback however, is the unbalanced tables outside and the size inside.  It's very compact, and if you're not careful when sitting outside you could lose your drink to the shaky tables that lean down the slight hill."
"""This is a nice little place. I enjoyed my taco salad. The food is good, but what one would expect at this price point. The people that work there are what makes this a place I'll return to. Very friendly and attentive. They are chipper, and they smile and look happy. They make you feel happy and welcome. We sat on the \""""outside\"""" patio. It was nice and fresh and open, but really noisy. So I recommend this area for the kids and boisterous friends. First dates and intimate conversations would be better inside."""
"Ocha is awesome.  Ocha taught me a lot of things - mainly how to drink, but we won't get into that here.  Ocha taught me about Thai food, basically.  \n\nWe went here one night about a decade ago because we heard tell that someone would let us sing karaoke.  So we showed up, and the entire restaurant was filled with Thai people.  Yes, there was karaoke, but there was also the opportunity to try some authentic Thai food that was obviously really good. I started trying all different things: pad thai, chicken satay, tom yum soup, thai fried shrimp, curries, etc.  All of it is great and has been consistently great for years.\n\nIt ain't fancy, and it ain't in a good neighborhood.  If you're trying to impress someone with a posh place, this isn't where to go.  But if you're trying to impress someone with good food, it ain't a bad choice at all.\n\nI don't know if there's karaoke there anymore, but that's not really the point anymore, now is it?"
"I've always walked and driven by this place but have yet to go in, after coming in twice within a week I can tell you I will be going here for lunch for a long time.  They have a ton of sandwiches, homemade soups, prepared foods and the staff is really friendly.  I felt a really good vibe being in there, very welcoming.\n\nI was there for lunch and had a chicken panini that was really wonderful, the homemade soup was great too.\n\nIf you live in the area or are just passing through check this place out."
Eric the massage therapist and Dr. Dollarhide are both awesome in their craft. If you've got a kink or need to get adjusted. I highly recommend this place.
"Been a regular here for lunch and post work drinks for over a decade. Menu is good, portions are huge, and they have the best wings around Concord Mills. If Mindy or Megan are working the bar, you will be taken care of, just don't be easily offended."
"A great, newly remodeled lunch place for us state employees!  I was surprised to see such a nice looking restaurant in this area....maybe because I eat at my desk, maybe because the area is shady.  The menu has your regular mexican items, which means refried beans to yours truly.  That's okay, because I got a bean and cheese burrito and was happy to see it not smothered in melted cheese and a ton of sauce.  Although I'm sure you can get it that way if you'd like.  The chips and 2 salsa's were delicious, service was fast for a busy lunch crowd.  \n\nThe inside looks really modern, without the cheap and cheesy looking mexican decor.  They have lots of space, and it's very clean.  Will definitely be back - hopefully for happy hour to try the margaritas!"
"This was a good, cheap ethnic restaurant, off the beaten track.  It's a few minutes north of Sahara on the Strip.  You know it's pretty good because locals eat there.  There is not a lot of seating, but we managed to snag a table right away at 1:30.  \n\nI liked my chicken dish, and my husband had the steak.  Very basic but tasty.  Not sure how authentic, but the owners are Cuban, so I'm sure it was pretty authentic.  The steak was very nicely marinated, tasty like the Mexican carne asada but a different flavor.  The chicken special (they have specials for each day of the week) had crispy, tasty strips of chicken, grilled peppers, and rice.  The avocado salad was good, but so simple that you could probably make it at home.  I wish I had tried the fried plantains - will do next time.  \n\nIt was very reasonable, and totaled about $30 for two people."
"What a lovely place! It's scary on the outside, but so cute and small on the inside! We first off served with water and boiled peanuts. I cannot stress enough how comforting our server was, who is also the owner! He encouraged us to try the side dishes he served us, offered more rice, offered Korean tea, etc. It was like eating at a relative's house. \n\nI loved my teriyaki hamburger steak along with the banchan, and I would love to come back again."
"The week of May 14-20, 2012 is National Beer Week. Any of their brews are $2 off. A pint of their beer is less than $3 for this week. It does not matter what time because this special is a 24/7 promotion. I tried the 38 special which is a blend of two different beers. It was smooth and enjoyable. \n\nPair any of these cold drafts with one of their monster burgers and satisfaction is sure to ensue. I got the Tex-Mex; a thick burger topped with a grilled green pepper, cheese, bacon, crispy sweet onion straws, and a BBQ sauce. With a side of their sweet potato fries for an additional $1 hit the spot. Although the fries were cold, the burger more than made up for it. My friend ordered the Big Dog burger and something else came out. In the end, we split both burgers to help alleviate his disappointment. Instead, we were both very happy. Maybe just closing my eyes and pointing would not be a bad option."
have been here twice.  Once for dinner which I thought was alright- nothing too special.  Second time for brunch which I was much more impressed with.
"Came here late night, a local friend of mine suggested it. He's mexican, so he should know what's good! \n\nCarne Asada Burrito: Got it with the typical beans, rice, onions, cilantro.. However, the meat here was pretty darn good! Definitely better than half the places I've tried here in Vegas. They also got the lime, red, green hot sauces at the usual, salsa/condiment bar. A little squeeze of citrus and some heat always does a burrito good!\n\nCarnitas Taco: Great flavor, not explosive but did the job.\n\nLemonade: They had this on tap/fountain drinks. So light and refreshing, haven't seen this drink option at any other mexican joints..\n\nI'd come back, if I'm ever around the neighborhood"
"For the price this place was a great deal,\nConvenient location, and a free breakfast meal.\nThe shower heads were very low in the bath,\nbut there were comfortable beds and an affable staff.\n\n\nDon't let the reviews deter you. The rooms are very, very nice. The beds were great and everything was clean.\n\nWoke up and ate breakfast in the morning. As long as I can get some protein I am OK, so I had some hardboiled eggs and microwaveable waffles. A couple cups of hot coffee and I was ready to rock!\n\nMy girlfriend and I swam in the pool because it was 65 degrees, but everyone else walking around the area was wearing sweatshirts and jeans. Did we look like tourists? Yup.\n\nThe staff at the front desk was very nice. The only negative thing about this place was the questionable neighborhood, but we had no problems. Just lock your car and you'll be fine. They keep the parking lot well-lit and have a security guard at night to monitor the grounds."
"We are regulars for weekend breakfast at the CBI so I won't be reviewing\nthe food.\nThis 5-star review is for our server, Nancy.  So professional, accommodating, and extremely nice and pleasant!!!!  CBI is lucky to have her on their staff!!!!!"
"Brixx is better since the botox. Not sure why, but I love the patio, pizza and salads. I always order my pizza well-done on the basic crust and could eat almost any of them that they would put in front of me. Beer specials are quite good. TIP: At the end of the year, you can buy discounted gift cards to use all year."
"This is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. I know it's in the same plaza as Lotus and many people like it, but Komol is my kind of place. They recognize regulars, serve some of the most amazing traditional Thai dishes and you really can't beat their prices. If you have veg friends, this is the place!"
All I can say is I LOVE everything about this place!!!   EVERYTHING!!!!
"Based on this visit, an EASY Five yelp stars!!!  Though they were out of the main item I was shopping for the lady who helped me was very good at making suggestions and asking the right questions!  Impressive!!!  The staff here is usually very good at giving direction and being very helpful!"
"Really nice rooms! Comfortable, friendly, includes breakfast. The design inside felt homey and didn't have the tacky comforters (thank goodness)."
"This place was bomb dizzle fo shizzle nizzle. Lol. They had some damn good mac and cheese. i ordered the lolos special, i think it was the #3 anyway, the chicken was real tasty and so were the waffles. Bring a camera when you come to this place because it has a real novelty aspect to it, this place might be a 5 star, but my waffle house experiences are close to none existent but i will edit my review if need be once i frequent more of these type places. Oh and they give you your drink in a big kerr canning jar 'pretty cool'"
Great filet and magarita
"This is the only place we order pizza from if we are too lazy to cook. Their pizza is fantastic. Their delivery is super fast (except late at night, but that's understandable). Their prices are pretty cheap as well. Love it!"
"Solid.  Great service, nothing fancy, high quality food with good portions for a fair price."
"""http://www.azpuppets.org/\n\nAdult Puppet Slam = My favorite thing to do in Phoenix.\n\n\""""Quirky, edgy puppet shows by Arizona's leading quirky, edgy puppeteers.\""""\n\nI've been to the last three Adult Puppet Slams, and they just keep getting better and better.  The writing is intelligent, and the puppetry is as creative as puppetry can get.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of stand-up comedy, especially of the 'dirty just for the sake of being dirty' variety, and these Adult Puppet Slams are right up my alley.  Before my first visit, I expected rude and crude humor (since the shows are 21 and over) and I couldn't have have been more surprised.\n\nThe shows are 'Late Night with Conan O'Brien' quality, and the theater itself - an old Mormon church - is worthy of a visit just for its architectural wonderfulness.  They serve cheap drinks, the shows are full-feature length, and the lobby doubles as the country's premier puppet museum.\n\nTwo notes:\n\nA) The shows are growing in popularity.  Buy your tickets in advance.\n\nB) The Adult Puppet Slams seem to pop up unexpectedly on the theater's schedule.  Visit their website monthly, or else you'll miss the show announcement."""
"""We love coming here to eat. We literally live around the block so I pass by it often and I have to stop the temptation to eat out. I've had many things from here-- mixed grill breakfast, meatloaf, country fried steak.. all winners in my book. They also have great drink prices and a very friendly staff who are all hard workers. They play bartender, food server, cook and a person to vent to. When bobby has a week day off of work, he will wake up and come here for breakfast. He'll then meet me for my lunch hour downtown and say \""""i'm not hungry.. i stopped at Nadine's\"""" I've heard that line atleast 5 times in the last 6 months"""
The quality and comfort of the shoes at this store is fantastic. The prices are in line/competitive for the quality of the shoes they sell. The employees are very knowledgable and friendly. It is a full service shoe store. My only gripe is that it can be hard to find someone to help you because they are busy - but once you get a turn they give you their full attention. They also have a punch card system where you can earn $50 off a future purchase by collecting enough punches. That was a really nice unexpected bonus to find when I purchased. I will go back again.
"I am a huge fan of this store, in fact I'm not sure it's a store... it's more of a community! If you need DJ equipment, they can definitely help you out and their rates are lower than what you'll get at Guitar Center. Plus, they will work with you to make sure you get what you need (and want). They also sell DJ lights, not my current needs - but good to know they have it.\n\nThe community aspect is that they offer free sessions to introduce extraordinary world of DJing to newcomers. If you're looking for digital DJ tips, go on any Tuesday from 4-6pm. Or, if you're into learning more about the classics... vinyl (old school DJing), visit MC Audio on Wednesdays between 3:30 and 7:30pm.\n\nThey are great at igniting (or re-lighting) the fire and motivating people to keep at it. I plan on visiting them regularly!"
"I just gotta give these guys the pizza crown. They deserve it. Real NY pizza, great sauce, authentic ambiance, this place just oozes NY. I think I would know, I was born and raised there... \n\nI went back again and ordered a large pie by myself and almost downed the whole thing. All I could think about was how amazing each bite was. \n\nI will always come back here. They are just a great bunch of people and the pizza is so good! Forget the rest, seriously. This is where it's at."
"Great Dive Bar! Make sure you bring CA$H.\n\nThey have a bar of many spirits, and bartenders who pour em strong, all at the right price. \nThe music is loud, the music is good, and the live DJ was a man at one with the beat. \n\nThe tiki vibe isn't laid on too thick, just enough to give it some personality. The place is small, but there were two bartenders behind the bar when I went and the service was pretty good. The parking lot is the only real downside, you might get ten cars in with a crowbar.\n\nOne tip, make sure you go out the back way on the way out for one of the best street vendors you'll find for some solid eats before you depart."
"I've heard good things about this place so I had high hopes, but nothing was too special. Despite the sweetness, the ice cream was still good and filling. I got the birthday cake!\n\nThe interior is cute and fun looking. Good for little kids. (:"
"Been here for a variety of events and always enjoyed this venue. I wish the ladies room was a little more accessible but beyond that, the seats are comfy, the stage is easy to view no matter where you sit, and the people who work here are actually helpful. Have yet to have a bad experience!"
"I am only reviewing for the Friday Seafood night, where they have snow crab legs. I LOVE going to this buffet for the all you can eat crab legs and oysters. For the price of 2 people, with your BConnected card it's roughly 50.00ish dollars, pricey, but if you'd see how much me and my husband can eat, it's actually a bargain, LOL. All other food is average buffet food, lots of different genres; Mexican, Asian, Salads, Desserts etc. etc. Only reason why it's not a 5 star rating would be because the service is a little slow =/"
"even better that the one on the Sahara, that is close. Friendly staff and very attentive."
"I brought my dog here to get spayed.  The customer service was warm and friendly.  The veterinarian explained the procedure thoroughly.  The veterinarian assistant explained the healing process, and the effects of the meds.  The day after the procedure I received a call checking on my dog, which I appreciated.  I will definitely bring my dog back again!"
"""I think this is a Top 3 Madison Restaurant for me.\n\nI've never been less than 100% satisfied upon each visit.  Their Curry Fried Rice is Curry Fried Ridiculous.  Ridiculously awesome, that is.  They have a curry dish w/shrimp and potatoes that's fantastic, too.  It was a discovery of my ex's that when you pour the sauce from the shrimp-potato dish over the curry fried rice, you're left with a sinful, drool-inspiring juggernaut.  As he put it, \""""Curry goes really good with more curry.\""""  \n\nThey have an awe-inspiring lunch special, and are otherwise kind of pricey.  Do I mind?  Not at all.  I would eat here every other day if I could afford it.  It's making my tummy rumble just thinking about it."""
"Quaint hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  I've only ever been for lunch, but the food is excellent and the service is lightning fast.  Thursday is Chicken and Dumpling day - out of this world!!"
"We were put hear for temporary housing I think the apt is nice the lay out is great.. The people are nice and the grounds are well kept! Safe and great location . Only issue is the proximity to the Main Street .. There is really nice friendly people hear and the back of this place backs to the ballentyne country club .so u can go running , walking back there .. My kids love the grassy hills we are thinking about leasing hear till our house is built . I recommend this complex"
"one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes...\n\nIn Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. I had the chicken fried steak (which is pretty much my favorite breakfast) & the girlfriend had huevos rancheros (didn't try but looked good). Overall, the food was very good & the place has quite the kitschy ambiance. I prefer chicken fried steak to be an actual cut-of-meat steak rather than a ground steak product. The former is rare & this place served the latter. The gravy, however, was distinctively outstanding & the potatoes, served as home-style chips, were pretty good too. If you're looking for breakfast in Vegas & not in the mood for the $50 buffet with the obligatory gluttony that accompanies it, Omelet House is a very good, much lower cost option that still serves up ample portions."
"I really enjoyed this place, the atmosphere and the food was awesome. They were so busy when I went so we just waited had a few drinks at the bar. The buffalo head did kinda freak me out but besides that it was a great experience."
"""What a fantastic tour guide! A much older gentleman that had a wickedly funny sense of humor! I mean, I laughed the entire trip, got lots of great information....and truly appreciated a \""""dam\"""" good tour! I purchased my tickets through Groupon and had no problem once in Vegas redeeming them for my actual tickets. To be honest, it looked like over half of the people in line had Groupon!\n\nThe tour guides at the Hoover Dam were equally as hilarious! By far out of the trip (gambling, drinking, club hopping), the tour was the BEST! \n\nI would do this tour every visit to sin city!\n\n* Note, the previous reviews are probably regarding a different tour bus operator that is no longer doing the Hoover Dam Tours....or they just went on a bad day :/"""
"""BEST COFFEE EVER\n\nLove this place.\nActually maybe a bit better than my other review of Victor Allen's...but I like their cafe a bit better. This is more of a place to stop by than to stay.\n\nGet the Ancora D'Oro for home, and the White Zombie for right now. (Almond flavor is my favorite) \nOr the mocha, which is heavenly. Seriously, the best mocha I've ever had. EVEREVEREVER. The chocolate has some weight, but blends perfectly to be a grown-up version of chocolate milk you had as a kid. \nThe White Zombie is a strange and beautiful thing. A \""""white coffee\"""" drink, it's light and powerful, you will feel like a high-powered cloud ghost zooming around after drinking this. They tried to change the name to White Lightning, but no one wants to feel a crackling electric jolt. Don't worry, the zombie will carry you through the day like a white flotaki magic carpet, smooth, airy and sensuous."""
I keep on vowing to try something else and always go back to the Chicken Feta Salad.  It is so good and the perfect office lunch.
great place!!!
Very nice hotel. Rooms were roomy and reasonably priced. The lobby and breakfast was actually edible (although not much beyond the high carb processed goods) and the staff was super friendly. I've stayed at quite a few Hampton Inn & Suites and this was one of the nicer ones. It's also right next to the Motor Speedway (about 1 mile away) so if you're in town for that this place would work great.
"I am very picky about my asian food, being asian myself. But this place is actually one of best chinese food restaurant in las vegas. Hubby ad i always go here when we are craving chinese. The portions are good for the prices they charge. Since we always do take out, customer service isn't bad. Of course whenever we do place take out they tell us it'll only be 15 minutes but they are pretty busy so it's usually an additional 10 minutes from what they actually tell you.  \n\nI love won ton soup, but im quite picky about it however i will say that hands down this place seems to be the only place that makes really delicious wonton soup. \n\nGreat for the wallet and the tummy!"
"My husband and I came here for a date night and I am so glad we did! Since we bought our tickets online,  we were VIP (LOL) and were sat right away. \n\nHowever, we were sat at this little rinky-dink table with another couple! I mean, this table was meant for two people,  but they packed four people AND their drinks at it. It didn't help that the other couple was unfriendly and the girl was bitchy. I was hoping to have our own table. \n\nAnyway, our server was OKAY. She gave me the wrong bill twice which was super annoying. \n\nThe comedians and the DJ were hilarious. I would definitely come back here if I could get my own table next time."
My wife found this place on Yelp.  She wanted to get a manicure and pedicure without paying the crazy prices on the strip.  We made appointments that same day and were taken in right away.\n\nI'm not an expert on manicure and pedicures.  But I have to say they were very thorough and did an great job with my hands and feet.  My wife happened to tell me that this was one of the best manicures and pedicures she's ever gotten.  We're sure to visit again on our next trip to Vegas
"Well it is a Mexican place that is close to downtown that actually has waiters so that is a big plus right there.  The chips and salsa that seem obligatory with Mexican places were pretty good.  I ordered a spinach and feta burrito or something.  I couldn't really see it because it was burried under a ton of this cream sauce stuff - not that I minded, that stuff was good!  My burrito thing was really tasty and I'd probably order it again.  Their menu was a bit overwhelming and I wish it had some pictures cuz I had no idea what most of it was.  In the end, it was good, and I'm sure I'd go back."
"I've always had fun when I've been to Wandos.  You never have to wait long in line, and there are three different floors to choose from if you need a change while your inside.  I love the third floor because it's probably the most spacious. They don't have the greatest drink specials, but why should they right? I mean I feel like they're always busy.  A fish bowl is must if for no other reason than that it is what they are known for.  I personally like the orange the best.  The bartenders are all cute, the music is nice, and it's an overall nice atmosphere.  Did I mention bacon night? Yes please."
The shrimp fried rice was delicious as well as the salty spicy shrimp but the salty spicy squid was over cooked... It was pretty busy inside which is a good sign. Long story short I will come back again
"The only authentic thai restaurant on the strip. They can even cook food not on the menu. Beef Jerky, Padthai noodles, Crispy Pork with Broccoli and Papaya Salad were all good. Other than the food, you have excellent customer service by everyone from the server to the owner. I actually cant remember a friendlier place to eat than this! Food was served really fast too. Highly recommended!"
"I love saving money!!  I was just browsing, and I did not expect to buy anything.  I found a deal that I could not pass up though.  I think that they normally have a buy 1 pair get the 2nd pair for half price.  I was able to get a pair of shape up shoes for $39.95 and a second pair of shoes for $14.97 (Orig. $44.95)!!  \n\nI used my shoes to go hiking at Red Rock Canyon later that week.  I haven't used the shape ups yet.  I probably won't need another pair of shoes for awhile....but if I do, then I will definitely go by here again."
"This place is too good. Service is amazing. Meat parilladas are perfect. The chimichurri sauce goes well on everything. Wine, beer, deli, desserts, all you need. Too good."
"Its been nearly 4 years since I have been here, but honestly, its the best Japanese food I have ever had. The tempura was out of this world and the Ousimono was great. And the sushi, was amazing! I wish I had been old enough to yelp back then!"
"When you walk in you will not be overwhelmed with the decor, but we were greeted by a manager and seated promptly.  The bar is inviting.  There is a lot to choose from and if my stromboli is any indication, you get a ton of food.  The prices may not seem to match at first but when you see the size of the portions it all makes perfect sense.  There is no reason to ever leave here unsatisfied.  \n\nThe stromboli was great too."
Serving persian food in fast food setting. Very clean and well done food. I had chicken kabob plate and cucumber and yogurt. Liked the quality of food and the atmosphere. The lady un the counter was noce and helpful. The food was reasonably priced. Liked the freshly baked bread as well. I recommend if you are passing through the area of working close by. Not suitable for parties of dates ! Lol
"I love the fact that this Trader Joe's is super close to me. It makes it handy to pick up snacks which is what I usually get here. I love trail mix and they have a large variety at reasonable prices. I don't have much of a sweet tooth so I appreciate the fact that so many of the trail mixes don't have chocolate or other sugary add-ins.\n\nThey also have a decent variety of salads, sandwiches, and other pre-made foods for a last minute meal.\n\nThe other nice thing is their produce, which is organic yet reasonably priced. \n\nThe selection isn't huge so I've never been able to make it a one stop grocery shop, but it is good for inexpensive unique items."
"Awesome food, friendly staff, and quick if your on the go and order out! I would like it if it wasn't in such a sketchy spot but hey, the food makes it 5 stars so what ever! I get the veggie Pho and goodness I swear I dream about it. I also have gotten the spicy shrimp with noodles and veggies and it is great! Tons of seating, so if your going with a group you're set, just on Sundays for brunch go early as it gets packed!"
"Landmark was recently featured on the Food Network and for good reason.  \n\nWhere do I begin?  Ok, maybe with the breakfast.  They serve breakfast all day (they close at 1 or 2 AM).  Homemade pancakes that cover the plate, French Toast using homemade bread, sausage, grits, and the works for around $6.\n\nThe gyros are out of this world.  No pre-frozen cheesteak on a pita.  The gyros is filled (I mean filled) with lamb, beef, and homemade tzitki sauce.  They serve it with greek salad and the dressing?  Yep, you guessed it, homemade Greek dressing!\n\nThe waiters and waitresses are a friendly bunch.  I went at night and was served by lady in her 60's with a beehive, very funny and warm.  The desserts look amazing, but the portions are so big that I never get to them.  A great place to take visitors and necessary pilgrimage if you have a big appetite for Greek, southern, and/or breakfast food.  I guarantee you'll love it."
"Definitely love the half price lobster when they had the special. I ordered the lobster with thai chili sauce and it was to die for. I ordered the lobster fried with xo sauce before and it wasn't as good as the thai chili style. Honey walnut prawns were the best. Fried sea bass was fresh too. baby bok choi with garlic was a little greasy but perfect. Word of advice, take a chinese friend with you who knows how to order cuz the experience will b 10,000 times better."
"This restaurant has been in Madison for decades, but I have only enjoyed it for a few years now. \nThe GARIBALDI is the sandwich that put this place on the map. I suggest getting it with a mix of sweet and hot peppers. \nBut all the food there is excellent."
Love the bakery small place and they know your name after you have been in a couple of times where else can u find that in this day and age great lunches an Saturday breakfast is to die for the cakes are amazing and they have about 15 different soups that are made from scratch  and frozen in quart size makes dinner easy after a long day at work
"the associate Chris and the Manager Dan where very helpful. Chris is always willing to help me and is very knowledgeable, he knows alot about the products they sell and more. every time i have a question Chris is able to answer it and explain it I explained my situation with Chris and Dan and they took care of me. I shook there hands and thanked them. Thank you Chris and Dan and thank you pepboys for hiring such good employees.\nSteve"
"Im pretty sure this the place I was at when I met this girl, I had 20 bucks came home with 8 so the drinks is cheap. Batchroom was clean. Anyway this girl game me some disease. AND I LOVE IT!"
"I've been a couple of times here and I think it's a very good choice if you are looking for good quality, good portions and excellent price. The have very accessible specials and most of them are very good in flavor and amount. The place looks brand new, and most of the time its pretty quiet and relaxing environment. There is thou, a waiter that apparently is always mad about something, but not in a bad way, it actually is kinda hilarious. The pad thai chicken is very good, the fried rice is awesome and most of the specials on the menu are good for any appetite. The place is on an area with not as many good options like this around, so i definitely recommend."
"I've been to a number of art museums in my lifetime, but the Phoenix Art Museum was pleasantly different from the norm.\n\nWe went for the Video Game exhibit, which I enjoyed immensely. I saw some parts of the rest of the museum, but mainly stuck to the exhibit.\n\nMy only gripes are that the bathrooms were a bit confusing to locate (I didn't have a map), the wandering staff wasn't terribly helpful (couldn't tell me where the bathrooms were), and that the gift store didn't have a good selection of magnets (I collect them)."
I love Cielo! No other salon in Vegas / Henderson has ever done as good of a job on my hair. Penny is the best! The salon always has great specials on spa services too.
"""I used to come here alot, when I worked right around the corner- it was convenient, before going home. On our recent weekend jaunts, we were in the area on sunday, and came here to buy Nutro dry dog food for our cocker-spaniel. This has always been a clean store, nicely organized, and fully stocked. On the weekends, there are adoptions going on, with many cats and dogs, ready for their \""""forever home.\""""  On that particular day, there were many families here shopping. Reliable store for pet food and pet supplies."""
This place was awesome!  Portions are Yummy and HUGE.  Why didn't I give it a 5?  NO wow factor..but still a great place to eat...I would go back in a second.
"Wings and fries were great! Honey Hot wing sauce was delicious and the blue cheese dressing was absolutely the best I've had in awhile. The only problem was the grilled wings came out ice cold! However,  They didnt have any problem taking them back. Laid back atmosphere. I will be back in the near future!"
"I stopped in here for a late lunch and it has been years since I dined here and I was glad to see they have not lost any of their atmosphere and food quality.  \n\nI ordered the black bean and chicken tortilla and it was great, just spicy enough and very tasty and then for dessert, I washed the main meal down with the pumpkin cheesecake, Mmmmmmm.\n\nThe service was above average and my drink never got to the bottom of the glass - thumbs up for the service!\n\nThis is one solid restaurant in my books and I will go back for sure!!!"
"""This Goodwill is a *little* better than other Goodwills I've been too. The clothes here are more modern and stylish and the crowd that shops here is younger. This store is small so I would recommend coming at least once a week to check for \""""new\"""" items."""
"Man there was a lot of food here! The wait staff was nice and prompt. It is a buffet, and there were all ages here from babys to grandparents, so family friendly I would say yes.. The food was pretty darn good for the price! I don't know if I will be a regular here (mainly cuz I don't care for small humans, they tend to be loud) But for the price the food was better than most fast food options out there and a good mix to choose from.."
"""A regular stop when we're in Las Vegas!\n\nLocated in the bizarre \""""Commerical Center\"""" off Sahara, a sprawling huge parking lot with restaurants, odd businesses, strange clubs and an occasional crack dealer and homeless guy with no shirt and a shopping cart stumbling around, we've come to love our dining experiences at Komol.\n\nIt's a friendly, family run place and we've had no big problems with the service like another recent reviewer.\n\nOnce seated you're presented with a heavy wooden menu! It weighs like 3 pounds!\n\nThey have great vegan options including soups, salads and wok-made dishes of all varieties, and a great portion of brown rice if you order it.\n\nOn a recent visit we requested that all of our dishes be prepared with as little oil as possible--but things were still on the oily side, especially our eggplant with black bean sauce dish which was positively greasy. It's almost as if the chef did the opposite of our request. \n\nSo, I'm deducting one star--I'm simply not a fan of lots of oil and grease in Asian food.\n\nBye for now; we'll see you on our next trip!"""
"This place is amazing. It's in Chinatown and a small dingy area run by these very friendly people. The donuts here are AMAZING. \n\nALL OF THEM! I can't explain how good they are (I know they are donuts...but these are just so good).\n\nBoston Soy Creme - Ok....no idea I was eating soy creme. This thing is so sweet, moist and tasty. It's addictive\n\nGlazed - Best glazed I have ever had!\n\nDonut Holes - Portion Controlled Pockets of Heaven\n\nI'm not a fan of chocolate donuts but  co-workers of mine (I brought in Ronald's) now drive all the way to Ronald's on the weekends to have breakfast. \n\nNot just for vegans (although a large selection of their donuts just happen to be vegan). This place is for everyone who enjoys a good sweet treat!\n\nYum Yum...I've never been this obsessed with donuts till I met Ronald's!"
Consistently good pizza. Only place to get good deep dish pizza in the city. This place is better than any of the Sq Hill places people flock to like Mineos.
"I'm usually next door at the Wings place, but today I wanted something a little different. Good choice.\n\nGreat selection of quickly made entrees. I do not think that they pop stuff out of a microwave here at all - it's made right to order. Friendly service and so darned fast! You can see right into the small kitchen where it's all prepared.\n\nI had the chicken curry with brown rice. Great flavor with nice, crisp veggies and plenty of them. Lots of chicken too! Clean plate! A great deal for a fresh meal for under $7 with tip.\n\nTV's on opposite sides of the restaurant. Parking is a bit of a challenge. Try the lot across the street next to Moe's and the YMCA."
I had the chicken and dumplings it was great. My husband had the meatloaf  his plate was clean when we left. Service was friendly and guick   The place was clean and neat.  Would go back
"My husband I went here for a nice dinner and looking for a little atmosphere with our night out.  We found exactly that with Otto's.  The martini at the bar was served very chilled, they have a decent wine list, although not the best I've ever seen.  The entrees were delicious and presented beautifully.  The only critique I can offer is that the wait staff was a bit cool in reception and serving us at our meal.   The charm of the old farm house was warm, delightful and gave us a feeling of old world charm coupled with fine dining.  Will definitely go back."
"I took one of my two dogs in today to Commonwealth Animal Hospital and received the same great service everyone else raves about.  We got a friendly welcome from reception and got more smiles from the nurses and the vet.  They were quick, knowlegeable  and answered all of my concerns without dismissing them.  \n\nGreat experience and, needless to say, I will be bringing my second dog in shortly for his routine check up!"
"I love this place! The food is surprisingly good. Since I have a dairy allergy, I stick to the turkey pita club and its delicious every time. Also good - hummus, calamari, soup of the day every time, onion rings, bbq bacon burger!  Don't let the pool tables fool you; this is a classy joint."
"I think this is the most under rated brunch spot in Madison.  The bacon, cheese, egg croissant is delicious beyond comparison.  I'm also a big fan of the citrusy vinaigrette they put on the side salad that accompanies many dishes.  Outdoor seating is nice for when the weather is cooperating and they have ample indoor seating as well.  My only complaint would be that the coffee is way overpriced for so-so quality."
"I am writing this review for the pharmacy . I have been getting my prescriptions here for a while now and have always had a pleasant experience in addition to cheap prices. On top of the it is open 24 hours and they can email, call, or text you when your prescription is ready. When I went to pick up my birth control the woman helping me gave me a lot of information and helpful tips about taking it and regulating my cycle . It was very much appreciated because not many people go out of their way to inform young women of the importance of birth control :)"
"Okay, I know this place has been yelped 99 times before me, but I just have to say how much I LOOOOOVE their waffles!!!  I've been there about 3 other times prior, and today was no different!  On this particular day I had the #10 which is two legs and a waffle, and then I had a side of mac and cheese.  As with every other time I'd been here, they did not disappoint.  The chicken was on point, crispy and well seasoned, the mac and cheese was oooey gooey cheesy goodness, and the waffle was oh so scrumptious!!!  They're light and fluffy, they have a hint of cinnamon, the butter they put on top is also fluffy, and the syrup is served hot.  It's orgasmic!!!  So if you want some bomb chicken and the best waffle you've ever had in your life, go to Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffles!!!"
"I spent a couple of days in the Carolina's with a single goal: to find Carolina-style BBQ and find out what all the fuss is about.  I enrolled in Carolina BBQ 101 at Bill Spoon's and I think I got a good education.  \n\nThe menu is simple and straightforward, which is greatly appreciated, I recommend getting the pulled pork, it's what they're known for.  I've never had hush puppies outside a seafood place, but I found they complement the meal pretty well.\n\nThe food is tasty & reasonably priced, the environment is casual & comfortable, and the staff is very friendly. *like button*"
"Yes! Such a great Chick-Fil-A.  \nFor some reason my wife and I started a list of the 5 best places in Charlotte for customer service and this Chick-fil-A in particular is probably #1 on our kind of cheesy but totally cool list.  Whether I go through the drive-thru or into the restaurant, I am always greeted with a smile and by a friendly face.  I look forward to eating here not only for the fresh and delicious food but for the helpful and happy atmosphere.  And while I may not agree with some of Chick-fil-a's policies (you know what I'm talking about), how can I expect people to respect my opinions if I don't respect theirs?  So let's focus on the great food and service and the things we have in common instead of those we do not!  Do yourself a favor and eat here!"
"BEST BLACKBEAN BURGER EVER IN MY LIFE.\n\ni miss crane alley. it was my go-to restaurant in the CU area. \n\nalways: blackbean burger, no sprouts with a side of greek pasta salad. even better with a bloody mary or a spicy martini, there's a specific one that i'm talking about but i can't remember what it's called...\n\nthey also have an AMAZING beer selection. every time i go there are a few new draft beers. definitely try a beer flight. \n\noh and the sweet potato fries. so goooooddddd.\n\ni've tried a few other items on the menu, but after finding the blackbean burger there was never a reason to order anything else. SERIOUSLY THE BEST EVER. 5 million stars."
classic great atmosphere fresh yummy
Omg I love this place! Cheap and cheerful and just jokes! When I was in Vegas I simply had to stay here!
"Busy at 2:30 in the afternoon. This is one of the few off strip high quality places in Vegas. We had the Roppongi roll, 911 roll and Tiger Rolls, all incredible. The bldg/decor is not that great bit the food is top quality. The Toro ranks at the top. Prices very reasonable."
"I loved the basic fish taco they serve.  It is simple yes, but delicious.  I wasnt a fan of the sides but the tacos definitely made up for the lacking.  Our waitress was really friendly and very attentive.  I am definitely going back  when I move to Charlotte."
"For what it is - a cheap Mexican restaurant - this place gets 4 stars. I have been going here for the past 4 days for lunch and I sit at the bar. The staff is really friendly. \ntheir food is great, and that $4.99 menu is fantastic - no skimping on portions here! Their chips are great, but I don't think they serve beans any longer with them.... at least not at the bar for the times I went. The salsa is muy authentico!! \nSuper Mex is a hidden gem for a cheap, full-portioned, and tasty meal."
"Been here a bunch, usually come on Sunday mornings. Service is decent, food is great. I usually get the garden skillet with the bisquit and gravy. Ive never been disappointed with this place or their other stalks and yolks location."
"Randy gives a great pedicure! I came from out of town and was blown away by the way he handled my feet...awesome. The place is not fancy, but definitely a hidden gem. The price was right!"
"While the comedians themselves are hit or miss (such as the way of stand-up), the overall experience is consistently good.  We've been to the new space a couple of times now, and it's a tremendous improvement over the old location.  The admission is reasonable at $10.00 a head without a coupon.  Make a reservation and settle in, order a couple of drinks and relax your fine self.\n\nAlthough it has a two-drink minimum in the showroom, the drink prices are fair and the drinks themselves are not half bad."
While visiting friends in Charlotte they showed me the lay of the land with a must visit to Manifest.  Did not know what to expect when we got there. The shopping center was stuck in the 1970's. The place was awesome. Liked that the used DVD's and CD's were buy one and get the second one for $1. I was very proud of myself that I did not get too crazy shopping with this deal. The selection was great and got some good CD's. Will be going back on my next visit.
"We've used Presidential Limo several times over the last few years and have always had a positive experience. Our drivers haven't minded stopping at a liquor store on the way to our hotel and have been very accommodating. They've always been on time, are friendly and have a smile on their face. \n\nThis past weekend with friends, we didn't have time to make a liquor stop AND get our picture taken at the 'Welcome to Las Vegas' sign, so our driver offered to pick us up early on our return trip so we could stop at the sign. So nice!\n\nFor the price, they can't be beat! Not sure if they're the most economical, but  it doesn't matter since we get such a high level of customer service - and that means a lot to me. \n\nCars are always clean and are stocked with cold water and champagne. \n\nI definitely recommend Presidential Limo for your next soiree in Vegas!"
Very good Italian food-which has been hard to find here in Charlotte!
"""I like Kabul's flatbread and chutney a lot. (Each table has two chutneys, roasted red pepper and cilantro.)  The salad dressing is very good, but the salad veggies are your conventional iceberg lettuce, bitter carrots, and mealy pink tomatoes that were probably shipped 2000 miles.  I usually order the salad anyway (since the only soup is non-vegetarian) and then dip the bread in the dressing.\n\nVeggie entrees are in a separate section of the menu, so they are easy to find.  Some of Kabul's entrees are mediocre, but I *love love love* their veggie strudel (which is not on the menu but the never-changing \""""specials\"""" board).  It is a spinach, feta, and mushroom streudel in a flaky phyllo dough crust, and it's topped with a spicy tomato sauce.  I also get cravings sometimes for their veggie ashak or their fasuliya, both mildly spicy veggie dishes served with yogurt sauce (though I remember thinking they were pretty hot when I was a teenager).  The entrees are all reasonably priced.\n\nFor dessert, try the firni!  It's great."""
HELLO BIRTHDAY CAKE ICECREAM! I was with some fellow Carnegie Mellon alum and they swore that I needed to get the Birthday Cake. I am not one to be craving ice cream but it was so good.
I've been to Roxy's twice this month and so far the service has been consistently ok. I ordered the burger during both visits and thought it was consistent too. The service is great during both visits but much like most Vegas restaurants you feel a bit rushed.
"Holy cow, this place is good.  My boyfriend and I had wrote down the address as a place to go in Las Vegas, and when the GPS brought us here, we almost didn't get out of the car!  The strip mall is shady looking, but have no fear, the food is amazing!  The staff was helpful, and the service was prompt.  If I lived in Las Vegas, I think I would become a regular here.  Everything was amazing!"
"Pho is really all about the broth and these guys really hook it up. It's the first place I go when I've been out of town too long.  Good service, clean, and really good food."
Restaurant is situated on the Dessert Shore lakes. The food was good and the service was great. The trout that we had had some bones on the fish The food was a little bland but the ambience more than makes up the lack of flavor its a great place for dates due to the location. Have not tried the dinner service will keep you guys posted as soon as we try dinner.
"""Not to brag or anything, but I've had some damn good donuts in my day. And Ronald's stacks up with the best of 'em. \n\nMy donut obsession began at an early age, when my Dad used to take me with him to Harold's House of Donuts in Decatur on Saturday mornings while we waited to have his car washed/detailed next door. As I got older, these trips became few and far between, but they'll always hold a special place in my heart. Heartwarming, I know...\n\nBut as I said earlier, I've had some awesome donuts since then, including World's Fair Donuts (St. Louis), Voodoo Donuts (Portland) and Psycho Donuts (San Jose). Each one has their own \""""shtick\"""" and I happily gobbled up the offerings. What I liked about Ronald's is that there is no gimmick-  No cereal on top, fancy colors or witty names, just classic donuts at their best. It very much reminded me of Saturday mornings with my Dad at Harold's. Simple and a tad nostalgic. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and able to get out from partying on the Strip to try some truly local food, definitely hit up Ronald's. Nothing fancy, but it hits the spot."""
"Love this little place! It is a reliable whole-in-the-wall, neighborhood restaurant. I've never stayed to eat there, it is a little run down, but it is a perfect take-out place. You are always greeted by the same friendly people who take your order and get it done fast. The prices are great and the portions are generous. There are several other (American) Chinese places to choose from in the area, but this one just always gets it right. I have tried most of the items on the menu and favor them all over their competition. Their egg rolls, sweet & sour chicken, and vegetable lo mein are my favorites, not to mention their Chinese donuts are just a sugary, melt-in-your mouth piece of heaven! If you are in this area of Mint Hill, drop in and get some take-out, I promise it won't be the last time you make your way to Hop Feng II!"
"I drive all the way from Canada just to come to Fleet Feet -- that's how good this place really is. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Ask them about the Pittsburgh Marathon and they'll talk your ear off.  I'll definitely make a return visit if I'm ever in the PGH again.  If you're an athlete or just looking for the right pair of running shoes, this is the place to go."
It was a very cold day in Pittsburgh on Tuesday- minus 8- but it was a great day to \nget some serious chicken dumpling soup at Nadine's.  I went with friends- we all enjoyed the soup I had the Turkey- well cooked not too dry and the smash with gravy was heaven- my gang had fried bologna sandwich  and number #1 selling Roast Beef-\nIt warmed us up- This is a friendly local hot spot that has not let TV stardom go to their heads.
"I was home in Madison visiting my parents had a very nice time at Nau-Ti-Gal.\n\nWe were able to enjoy the outside seating which was very nice.\n\nMany people in boats pulled up to have dinner.\n\nThe entertainment wasn't that great, but it was easy to ignore.  It was some singer and guitar player who were kind of blah.\n\nThe food though was great.  Very Wisconsin and when I return to Wisconsin I have a craving for very Wisconsin food, unhealthy as it is.\n\nParents each had some sandwich that they enjoyed.\n\nI had some fried fish thing with clam chowder which I enjoyed very much.\n\nThe staff that work there are very young but very nice and responsive."
"""This place is a great \""""dive\"""" bar. Walked in during the middle of the day on a Wednesday and I got the feeling I was hidden away from the world. It was dark, dank and the service was awesome. I forgot it was a beautiful sunny day outside in no time and the people watching was the entertainment there. Loved it."""
"We have been going to the Osaka on Sahara for years.  If you can get past the crazy entrance and the basic first dining room, you will be impressed with the other rooms, the prices, and the tasty food.  We love the choices offered, and it is always fresh and prepared to our specifications.,  We had friends fly in for business, and told them to go there to eat.  they really questioned my recommendations as they entered, but at the end of the meal, they raved and raved."
"Hands down - best steakhouse in Madison. Can't beat the food, service or location"
"First time and the food was excellent... the place is small/intimate. Our waiter was a little 'much' with all his talking but overall enjoyed the food/experince. Only complaint was draft beer was warm and the glasses they were served in were warm which didnt help (we had two different beers) BF had the crabcake salad, said it was best west of charleston, I had the burger with pimento cheese and onion jam which was amazing, I ate the whole thing which I rarely do when eating out, BF did get one bite which he was lucky to get!"
"The Spa was clean and well organized, and the prices are hard to beat. I can see why the RJ gave them the best of Vegas award. The 80 minute couples massage was fabulous, and I was impressed with the amount of treatments they have from Facials to Belly wraps. I will be a regular for sure."
"This is, in my opinion, an above average store. It's always clean and well stocked. The staff is friendly and very helpful."
Superisingly very goog for a 10 dollar dinner buffet.   Both my wife and i tried as many different items as possible.   Most all exceeded our expectations.   We now plan on returning for their 6 dollar breakfast buffet someday based on this meal.
"Delicious chai latte. Love that they give you real mugs, not paper cups, if you stay inside. Very spacious and open with lots of seating. Yeah service is a little slow if there are a lot of people because there is just one guy behind the counter, but it's a local business and I will continue to support it!"
"The best prices are on designer items like sofas & furniture.  Moderate prices on antiques.  Great place to find accessories and artwork, too.  Really nice, knowledgeable staff -- no snooties!"
Always good. And good prices too.
huge selections and the customer service always seem to be helpful.
"the food itself is worth 4 stars, tasty toasted subs-parking is not the greatest but its worth the effort"
"Service is great! Also on time and very friendly,tech was clean and treated use well."
Good service and very nice employees!
"We have only experienced amazing things at this apartment complex.  The staff does more than help you with your residential experience, they befriend you.  Everyone who lives at Yorktown is amazingly nice.  It feels like you are a part of a giant family.  The crowd consists of young families, young singles...skips a few generations...and has a strong retirement presence.  I don't mind, because it's always quiet.  I would however like breakfast to be served a bit earlier, because we young ones have to go to work!  Although that's not too much to complain about, because it's free breakfast every week day. Pretty darn awesome.  \n\nThe landscaping is pristine.  There are illuminated pathways that allow you to walk your dog at night and still feel safe.  The location is super convenient to shopping and  dining in the west side.  There are enough giant trees and nature to make you feel tucked away in your own privacy.  \n\nThe yorktown estates is luxury living and I can't imagine living anywhere else."
Authentic Vietnamese entrees. I enjoyed the beef vermicelli dish. Good spot and would recommend. Service was a bit slow though so don't be in a rush.
The service is a little slow but the people are so nice and the food is so delicious it's totally worth it!
"Ahhh, this brings back memories or walking down to lunch from High School.   We swung into Pasquals for lunch and while it was not as good as I remembered it was still delicious.  \n\nI got the good old Taco Dinner with shredded beef and I love shredded beef taco especially at Pasquals.  Honestly, I cannot say anything bad about our lunch at Pasquals except it was good food (still not he best but very good).   I also loved the Nachos that had mass amounts of cheese melted to perfection.  When you get Nachos and do not have naked chips left over is always a plus."
"This is a cool Starbucks , great atmosphere , tons of seating inside and out . Staff are fine , they remember my name and I only go once a week. They've got a dog bowl for Ozzy , wifi works , they pick up the old newspapers and clear the tables . No drive thru so when I'm starting a road trip with the family I do the Lake Mead / Rampart Starbucks. Very popular with local hot moms so dress nice guys!"
"Perfect for tourists like me that decide to brave the 15 freeway and drive 10 hours to Vegas, rather than hop on a plane and eat salty nuts. As soon as we arrived in Vegas we stopped at this little gem for snacks and some cold road sodas.  Ended up with some 3 packs of Bud Light ($4.99), Jalapeno Chex Mix ($1.89) and a couple other 20 oz. sodas ($1.59).\n\nWe were in and out of there really quickly due to convenient parking up front and fast service.\n\nAlso nice is that they will give you change on your debit card. Not all places do this.  7-11s do but only up to $10.00.  We took $40 back in change from our purchase! Love being able to do that."
"100% prettiest, fanciest place i've ever seen in my life.  absolutely breathtaking.  from the lobby with rock features and waterfall, to the lit up painted ceiling, to the enormous pools that overlook golf courses and lakes as well as wide 360 views of the surrounding mountains, etc... just... wow.  even the stairs have little decorations as big as my head.  a random pot of flowers sitting in a corner was twice as tall as me.  i felt like a little ant."
"In my humble opinion, the best steakhouse in Madison. Oh I grant you, Madison has no shortage of quality steakhouses (Tornado, Wonder Bar, etc). But Delaney's stands above all. \n\nI have never had a better bone-in ribeye, even in Chicago. Plus, unlike a lot of the other steakhouses in Madison (looking at you Ruth Chris), they include a side and a soup/salad with your meal. Under $40 for steak, side, starter??? Yep, sign me right up. \n\nFor appetizers, the onion straws and button mushrooms are can't miss. Great intro to a night of incredible food. \n\nAs far as drinks go, it would be hard to find more knowledgeable and engaging bartenders in Madison. They have an extensive wine list, and even more important, a great bourbon/whiskey selection. Everything pairs together amazingly for a great dining experience."
My personal favorite!
"The orange scrub on your legs and feet feels so good! Very relaxing, very nice staff."
"""As always this Carraba's always aim's to please and this last trip was no different. Great food, great atmosphere, and great Service. A winning combination. Now if they would just get \""""Red Oak\"""" on tap. That might change my mind to 5 stars."""
"I absolutely LOVE this place! It's me and a few of my friends secret spot. When friends come to town, although, I always have to take them there to get their full Vegas experience. I found this place looking up historic places in Las Vegas. \n\nThe surroundings can be a little scary. Lots of homeless drunks around there, but the custard is so good you don't even care. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of the fact that it's cash only, but you just gotta remember to get some money before you leave, and if you forget, there's a gas station right behind it with an ATM you can go to.\n\nI always get the bumble berry and top it with bananas. Friends and family have tried a variety of their sundaes and daily custard specials and have never been disappointed! A regular is HUGE!"
"This place is by far one of the best BBQ places I have ever ate at. The baked beans, brisket, ribs, mac n cheese were incredible. The portions are huge and delicious. I live across town and do not mind driving over here to eat. The eating area is outdoors which is the only drawback. It's just too damn hot in the summer here in Vegas to be eating out doors. Besides that, the food is great and I highly recommend this place!"
"We usually try to eat here whenever we visit from SoCal. I always get the spicy noodles (vegetarian), it is not on the menu, but they will make it and they never disappoint.  Beware, their 5 is pretty spicy!"
"I'm staying at the Hilton & a familiar face, within walking distance, was in order. This fit the bill perfectly. Excellent bartenders, hats off to Mallory & Miranda. So-so beer selection, tho, that's why the 4 star instead of 5.  \n\nI ordered the ribeye, very rare, & was brought a ribeye mid well, much to my chagrin. Mallory watched me cut into it & immediately whisked it away for another try. The second steak could only have been better had it been first. Fork tender & seasoned to perfection. \n\nThe regulars at the bar are a hoot & very informative to those who don't know the area. I will definitely be back!"
"Yet, another great Hampton! \n\nMy wife, son, mother and I stayed at this hotel en route from Northwestern PA to Northeast FL. The rates were ridiculously low and the rooms were very spacious, and included a whirlpool tub. The only downer was that our room had the slightest hint of smokiness...not enough to be a big deal, but you could tell it was a smoking room a long time ago. I would stay here again!"
"I would give Komol 10 starts of they had that option.  For vegetarians and others alike I cannot praise this place enough. Food out of this world,  portions large and great value.  This will be one of our regular on every trip to Vegas."
"Every single thing to eat at Buraka is delicious - with the exception of the little salad that they give before every meal.  Tibs, Baris, any of the spicy bits . . . so good.  And the lentil salad at lunch time is divine!  I don't live in Madison anymore, but if I did, I would still be eating at Buraka weekly - and hitting up the lunch cart!"
"Dr. Mueller was great!!! Very down to earth, listened and helpful. The staff was awesome, didn't even have to sit down, went from reception desk to doctors office ad he came right in! & they give a 40% discount if u don't use insurance!:)"
"When we moved to the mainland 11 years ago, first thing we did was get a membership and boy was that a good deal.  Over the years, we have had to use their services on more than one occasion.  They have rescued me a few times, especially in the 100 degree temps we have here in Vegas.\n\nWe also take advantage of the free travel information, like maps and tour books.  We go a lot and love to investigate the places we're going before we get there.  These maps and books help us do that.  \n\nThis is a must have service for anyone, where you travel or not, first time you need a tire change or tow, they'll come to your rescue and you'll understand why it's worth it!"
Wasabi ahi tuna\nBBQ mahi\n\nBoth were outstanding. My boss got the carne ones and those were better than the salmon ones.\n\nHighly recommend. 2nd time there Nd definitely not the last.
"Great location, nice enough room, great beds. I'm sure the views would be fabulous in summer, but looking out at a frozen lake and snowy terrace is just okay. The most impressive part of the hotel may have been the very nice workout room. The pool and hot tub was nice until a screaming child came to play. Overall very nice place to stay."
"I'm not a big expert on Filipino food but I do know my lechon and sinigang.\n\nI really like the people there, really good ambience. The lechon was good and crispy :) the lechon dipping sauce, was OKAY. but still didn't ruin my lechon experience.\n\nSinigang.. u cant really mess that up so it was really tasty to me :) I like the cafeteria style they have, super fast filipino food. I liked it a lot."
"Went here a few months back with some buddies of mine. I like the food here a lot. Heard great things about the pizza so we had some of that and pretzels too. And of course beer.\n\nThe food was pleasing. The pub itself has a cool vibe. Some tvs and decent service. It's a little more laidback than some other bars around the way. \n\nThe outdoor area looked awesome. It was a rainy day when we went, so I didn't get a chance to enjoy it, but I definitely want to hang out there. Plus I hear that Michael Jordan goes there sometimes, gotta run into mj!\n\nThe worst part about this place is the parking. Honestly if parking wAsnt such a hassle here I'd be here more often. But one of these days I'll be back. Cool place."
Lots of different people but I love Kerry. She does amazing 3D and they stay on. She is very creative!
"Colburn Enterprises is great. Completely predictable pricing. Worked efficiently, and gets the job done right the first time. Amber in the office is awesome and very kind. We will use them in the future."
Getting new winter tires for my vehicle next door at discount tire. Decided to have a lunch here. Very yummy coffee and tasty panini. Nice and clean lication. Long line but it took me less than a minute to place an order.
"They have a great Cornish pasty for only $4. It's a very good size and is a meal in itself.\n\nIt's not a U.P. style pasty with rutabaga and such but has  ground beef, potato, and onion. \nThey also carry do breakfast pies, cheesy pasties but for me it's the ground beef.\nThere's no seating however so plan accordingly. Closed Sundays too."
"I'm from Texas and been trying to find good bbq here...this is hands down the Best BBQ in Las Vegas! We thought we were in the wrong area when our GPS took us into a neighborhood and then we found it...the holy grail of bbq!!! For meat we got the brisket, hot links and rib tips. For sides we got the collard greens, mac n cheese, green beans, potato salad and cornbread. The portions are ridiculous, they definitely do not skimp!! Everything had such good flavor from the bit of spice in the green beans to the sweetness of the moist cornbread. The brisket was tender and the hot links had just the right spiciness. I can't say I could tell much of a difference in the hot or mild bbq sauce, but both were good. The line was a bit long but it only tells how good the food is and it was lunchtime on a Saturday, so we didn't mind! We live in the south side of town but I can foresee many more trips here in the future. So glad that we found this place!!!!"
"""Definitely one of the best \""""go to\"""" places for lunch in Downtown Phoenix. As a salmon lover, I have to split up the salmon offerings around downtown, and Yasda Bento is one of my favorites when I'm looking for something quick, reasonably priced, relatively healthy, and tastes great. Their Salmon Teriyaki Bowl is it. Broccoli is always fresh, love the option of brown rice, regular or large bowl. It just works for me and apparently many others. The manager is all about great service; which is efficient and quick. It's a small place and gets crowded very quick, AND they've been known to run out of MY favorite if I arrive too close to closing. Just sayin..."""
"Three way burro. Enchiladas. Chile Relleno. Beans and rice. Cheese crisps. All delish. This is my first stop when I come into town and it never disappoints. Can't attest to ambiance or service for dining in because we always take out, but food is always hot, ready when they say it would be, and we always have an ample supply of home made hot sauce to take home. Can't beat the prices or the authenticity."
This is by far the best mexican food in las vegas. They have almost anything you can think of but the tacos are the best. They are just the way a taco should taste authentic mexican. They only accept cash but do have an ATM inside for you to withdraw cash. The wait is only about 15 min for you to get you food .......but of course they're always packed so thats great service in my opinion. Everyone is friendly there if I could 20 stars not just five   :)
"Okay, I love this store.  You have to visit If you're looking for an ultra cool rug (simple geometric patterns) or end-table... Anything related to the home- but especially those.  Prices are phenomenal."
"Probably my fav store for Sanrio/Hello Kitty stuff in Vegas. Most official Sanrio stores only carry the current lines, but this one always has a huge variety of styles. Guessing its because they don't have a clearance section to get rid of current stuff, and for once that's a good thing. You get a lot more to choose from and they do also get the current lines too.\n\nSanrio is just one section of the store - its mostly Chinese language books, magazines and DVDs. Pretty big variety of those too"
"This place never disappoints, it's dirty grungy and tasty. All sandwiches are $3.50. I love the hot sausage, got it today but they also had stuffed peppers today for $1 that was also really good. If u want comfort food cheap in a family owned establishment this is the place.  Would so a dinner here but great for lunch."
"The parking lot has dedicated spots for ER patients, look for them.\n The cafeteria has done delicious pizza, if you get stuck waiting for a ride.\n Courteous, caring staff.\n They all seemed to care about me and what was up. No one hesitated when I asked for anything, like a warm blanket. Each person took the extra minute to make sure I was good.\n The check in was the fastest I have seen yet. No waiting while hurting, all done in the room, and taken care of for me while I was getting the EKG. :)\n I also loved the food, which is very rare at an ER. The Pizza was hot and fresh, and the workers there asked the person in front of me if she had enough Ranch? Whaaa? LOL\n I used their Phone Registration, and she was very nice, helpful, and sympathetic. You have to preregister three days in advance if you do it online but for emergancies they will do it by phone, then a quick run in to get the bloodwork done. Bing Bam Boom, done."
"Just stopped in for an ice cream cone with my friend!  We both got dipped vanilla cones....she got blue raspberry and I got the dipped peanut butter.  They were both delicious.  (And cheap!)  I feel like so many places mark up ice cream cones for no reason at all!  This place also reminded me of the burger joints where I'm from in Upstate NY.  You see them cooking on the grill....order at the counter and they bring it over.  It's a pretty small space, with outdoor seating.  I didn't try the actual food, but if you are looking for some greasy, cheap fare in South End check it out!!"
"""I am from back east, Waterbury Connecticut. I really love this place, it makes me a little home sick. The food is wonderful, the people who run this are the friendly, and courteous, and have class. They try to make everyone happy, that's a fact. I have seen the owner himself tell people \""""no charge\"""", if something was late getting out of the kitchen. If you want that New York style food and  atmosphere, look no farther. I travel to Las Vegas almost every week, and usually wind up here on a Friday night."""
"Good food, clean environment, friendly and fast service."
"Dr. Strickland is professional, courteous and a master of his craft. Add to that a finely-tuned sense of humor and your won't find a better, more knowledgeable and skilled chiropractor anywhere west of the Mississippi. Love this doctor!"
"I have to highly recommend Jozsa Corner to anyone looking for a unique and memorable dining experience.  It honestly feels like you're being invited into someone's home in Hungary to enjoy family recipes passed down from generation to generation.  The food is delicious, but the freshly baked bread was the best part of the meal.  \n\nHungarian food has never gotten the credit it is due outside of its country of origin (try finding a Hungarian restaurant as authentic as this anywhere), and this is the best I've had in the U.S.\n\nAlex, the owner and cook, is also an artist, with an amazing life story and he will talk your ear off about it.\n\nOn the downside, Jozca Corner suffers from a frequent Pittsburgh problem: BYOB.  It is also in an depressing area (think Post-Industrial Meltdown), and you have to make a special reservation here, since it's tiny and closes unexpectedly and periodically.\n\nAt the same time, aren't you tired of eating the same food over and over again?  Give this place a shot."
"Thank God for the  caring nurses and excellent Drs.My mom spent 2 weeks here, in ICU after lung surgery.  Its a nice hospital with an excellent staff.  Good food too!  Cheers and thank you to all the awsome people who took care of my Mom, Joyce."
LO LO's has the best DAMN CHICKEN in AZ! The people are always really nice. This is a place that as a local I tell people to go for fried chicken.  A+++++
"Really well organized and easy to find anything you may be looking for on the artist supply side.  We popped in for just a minute but we will for sure go back when we are in need of more canvases and paints. The staff was friendly and offered up help in guiding us to anything we may have been looking to find.  \n\nOverall: A\nA little bit of a drive from our house, but definitely has more to offer than Michael's or JoAnn's - and at better prices - in regards to art supplies!"
"The best sushi Ive had in Vegas my husband and I love it here! There is only one sushi chef, Ken, but he is very personable, like you've known each other for years. Awesome service, so seat at the sushi bar! Traditional Japanese sushi and fresh quality. Ask for the snake sake!"
"This place is awesome!!! All the techs are very great,i can honestly this is the best salon i have done my nails! Starting from the nail products all the way to the owner! They offer you always something to drink and not just water but soda and wine! I mean what other nail salon will make you feel so pamper and relax! I enjoy going to do my nails at this salon when im tired and feel i need to be pamper, because i know i will be in good hands! The nail products they use are amazing,the color and shininess last. All  the girls from my fam go to this nail salon and we have never complain!! Def recommend this place to anyone who is new or a resident in charlotte! Please DONT listen to these 2 bad reviews!! I been going to My Nails &Tan for 3 years you wont regret it !!!"
"Celebrations Bridal is wonderful!!! It was my first visit today and it was magnificent!!! The Bride and I visited on a Tue @ 5 pm with an appointment and everyone was so helpful, nice and knowledgeable!! Don't believe ANY of the ridiculous negatives reviews!!!!!  So glad we went and the bride was very satisfied!!!!! THANK YOU LAURA!!!"
"We have had breakfast here a ton, and its cheap and good. \n\nBut last night we decided to have dinner and I think we madea  good choice. I got the Philly Cheesesteak and it was good! The bun was fresh and stood up to the steak without getting soggy or falling apart! Wife got the grilled cheese with bacon....great tasting plamento cheese only thing could have been hotter. But overall great taste. Fries or also good but don't get the onion rings they are  not good at least this day. \n\nServer was great and made sure we had drinks and even gave us a to go cup!! \nCheck it out for a cheap dinner"
"I've always had a great experience here at Long. Conveniently located near Uptown in Dilworth on South Blvd, they're open till 7pm weekdays which is uber convenient for a dog mom that works late some days. There's always a ton of lovely vet tech ladies at the desk when you walk in and lots of seating on benches around the waiting area. I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a pedicure (walk in) or a check up (which we've made appointments for).\n\nPedicures here are $10 which is reasonable for me considering my 80lb dog thinks you're cutting his toes off and reacts accordingly each and every time he gets his nails clipped. A check up is $40, heart worm test is $32 and they offer a wide variety of meds at good prices (only a few dollars more than 1800PETMEDS' prices). \n\nWe've always had a good experience here with a young female vet & all the vet techs and will continue to go back. I would NOT recommend boarding here, though - the facility is older and the kennel area isn't spacious enough for a dog over 50 lbs, in my opinion."
"A lovely breakfast place!  Kind of pricey but I can tell the food is fresh and high quality unlike Mickie s dairy bar,and it's definitely a healthier choice."
"as far as fried chicken goes, this place is great!!!! Beware of the hours and they only take cash. Deffinetly worth a visit."
"I cannot believe all this time I've never visited this sushi joint..... It was an absolute treat fresh sushi/sashimi, don't miss to there specials!!!! I had bluefin tuna, yellow tail surf clam sashimi, and the most sweetest uni ever!!!! This is the only place I had so far that actually ask me of I want my uni from SD or Japan..... Oh and wait fresh wasabi!!!? Really really impress with this local treasure"
"Great food, soup and deserts. Had nice burger and great soup. Lot of variety on the menu, but make sure you save room for desert. A lot of great deserts, but I went for the very odd but tasty cookie dough egg rolls.\n\nI thought they were going to be made with phyllo dough, but was more true to an egg roll dough. In fact even had a bit of the smell of an egg roll, maybe due to the oil used. They were deep fried. Results is nice crisp outside, and gooey hot cookie dough inside. Topped off with chocolate dipping sauce, and some ice cream."
"My overall conclusion is that it's good for the price. If you're in a group and you're looking for cheap eats, this is a good place to go. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.\n\nPros: if you order large salads/appetizers, it can easily turn into a meal for two. Generally, the prices for large sizes are still under 10 bucks so if you find someone to split it with, or want to take some home, then it's a great deal.\n\nIt is all self service, which is nice because you don't have to tip a waitress (only the cooks/kitchen staff/bartender.. Definitely still tip!)\n\nThe grilled cheese is solid\n\nThe quesadilla was pretty good\n\nThe Mediterranean salad was mostly good. I'm not a fan of sweet couscous but that's a personal preference.\n\nCons: limited seating during big games \n\nThe atmosphere is a bit run down and leaves much to be desired"
"""We loved our trip to the Hoover Dam. We had a super awesome bus driver. I can't remember his name and it was not this \""""Steve\"""" guy. Whoever he was, he was very entertaining the entire way to there and back. The bus was clean, and while it was packed with people I didn't get that airplane feeling. I won't comment much on the tour as this is a review for the bus operator. The tour was fun and it was amazing to see the iconic structure that is the Hoover Dam. Speaking of Dam, I loved all the \""""damn\"""" jokes."""
"It's a bit pricey for a chain restaurant, but the food is really good.  Our servers were top notch and so friendly.  We will go back!"
Dinner was great.
"This is the best neighborhood establishment you could hope for. Staff is friendly and helpful. Food is always fresh and consistent. I never been disappointed, and neither will you."
"Went here fked up. It's pretty standard, not gunna lie, but WTF WITH THE PORTIONS! you get a lot of what you pay for!"
"I've been here many times with family and my little cousin even had a birthday party here. It can get busy here but it doesn't get crowded. I took my brother here (newbie bowler) and we had a great time. Today is Monday so we paid $1 for shoe rental and $2/game for each of us. We looked at the price list on our way out and the prices go up as the week goes on. Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays seem to be the most reasonably priced days to go, especially Mondays."
"Why do I love diners the most out of all food establishments? Perhaps because of my father, who loves diners? I cannot say. There's just something about simple food and a cast of characters that makes for a good time.\n\nThe two brothers that own this little mainstay of Madison are amusing. They're both quite friendly and make you feel at home. One cooks all the food by himself. The other orders, washes dishes, makes the coffee and rings you up. On a Saturday morning, it's like watching a low-budget Cirque du Soleil. Food is always spot on and the decor is everything a diner should be complete with counter seating. Many a morning did I spend at this little spot, driving my cholesterol through the roof. What a time... What a way to go..."
"Love this place. I've only been here a couple times and they have not let me down. I've had their beef, and egg salad sandwiches, chicken panini and smoked zucchini soup - amazing flavors all over! I'm going back for more and I got my eyes on some chocolate croissants. I've thought about purchasing their bread, which I notice many people coming I  just to get a loaf...but then I realize I probably couldn't replicate the flavors. I'll just have to visit more often.\n\nhttp://www.getnmahbelly.com/2013/10/madison-sourdough/"
"NOM NOM!!! Ok so it is a rare occasion that I will actually purchase a donut, but when I do it is from Ronald's because they have the tastiest selection of donuts ever! And a ton of vegan selections! And cute people working there! One time my friend (cough::Ally::cough) drove me here at 4am before driving me to the airport so we could enjoy a freshly baked vegan delight before skipping town.\n\nOH YEAH. One time, when I was way younger, I stopped here with another friend after a night of party times, and bought a donut there, and thought it was a nice gesture to buy some for my family (especially so my dad wouldn't yell at me for being out so late). Well I bought a dozen and I think I ate like 2 more on the way home. FAT ASS. But they're that good. And that is why I can go only maybe once a year. The end."
"I spent a couple of hours at Madison Sourdough and it was enjoyable from top to bottom. Corey D and I started with breakfast. I had a decaf latte and I know, I know. What's the point of coffee without caffeine? Being pregnant means I can't have too much caffeine, but I still really enjoy the smell and taste of coffee, hence the decaf version. And sometimes decaf tastes terrible, like the coffee gods are punishing you for having poor taste. But, this one was quite nice.\n\nFor food I ordered a selection of sides - a build-your-own-breakfast if you will. I had two eggs, a giant side of fruit, and a warm biscuit served with house made preserves. I enjoyed every bite.\n\nAfter breakfast we spent some time working, aka Internetting, and the connection was always reliable and the atmosphere calm and friendly. I would easily recommend this spot for breakfast, a bit of work, meeting up with friends, or baked goods!"
"If you want a legit college town experience go to Peter's Pub.  If you're out of the college scene (as I am) you can still enjoy Peter's for lunch.  If you're in college, go there at night and have some drinks (and for your 21st birthday go here for your horns).\n\nThe menu is stacked with pretty typical 'bar food' options, however, I had a really tasty, and quite healthy, berry salad for lunch.  My friends and I shared an order of homemade potato chips with French onion dip.  Delish!  \n\nOn previous visits I've enjoyed their sandwich wraps.  I know they also have some nice happy hour specials.  Service is decent and the atmosphere is relaxed.  Makes me glad I work for a University and can transport myself to my college days by going to Peter's.....this time as an adult who orders iced tea and salad, but still, I can reminice..."
"Not only are the chocolate chip cookies TO DIE FOR, but the service is impeccable.  I've been in only a handful of times, but the employees there greet me so warmly as if we are old friends.  I don't know if they recognize me or if they are just the nicest people in the world, but every experience in this bakery has been a more than pleasant one."
"This is a lovely store, with all kinds of jewelry (including a huge ring selection), artworks and imported clothes.  I go there mostly for fabric items.  I don't know how they cram it all into their small space, but they carry curtains, bedspreads, cushions and more.  The handcrafted rug and bedspread I brought home are just beautiful!  I didn't even ask, and they even gave me a discount just because I was buying the last patchwork bedspread on the shelf."
"I love O'Aces!  Solid food, some decent beer options (for Vegas) and pretty nice staff like Ingrid (who doesn't take crap from anyone).  Plus, Skip is there and he's a trip.  Even though he's a Yankees fan, he is a fun standby there at the bar.\n\nI also met Jimmy, another regular, who's a fellow San Francisco Giants fan and all four Giants game I watched at O'Aces were victories including the last two against the Reds in the NLDS.  So I may have to go back if my G-men fall behind in a series again."
"I have been to this location many times. The pancakes are excellent and the service is usually very good. I have requested turkey sausage or bacon for years, and they added it to the menu recently. So now I can visit more often instead of giving all of my money to the competitors."
I love this place!\n\nEveryone there is always so helpful and pleasant.\n\nThe prices are right.\n\nThey know what they are doing to keep everyone coming back
"We have used Liberty Heating and Cooling for many years now. They installed a new unit for us about 6 years ago and we always call them for routine service calls and maintenance. They are professional, honest, fair and friendly. I like when Robert (one of the owners) is able to take care of our calls but their other technicians (especially Jonn) are also very good. I highly recommend Liberty!"
"My name is Demetria and I'm a Belk-a-holic........Belk Southpark is my favorite department store.....yeah, I know it's not a big time department store like Nordstrom's, Neiman Marcus, etc, but I know for a fact their additional 50% off red dot sales cannot be touched by any of the other high end stores around. So if you like the name brand's but not the prices checkout a red dot sale at Belk Southpark, you won't be disappointed."
"Burgers, burgers burgers.  This was the best hamburger I've had in years.  I've had most every burger on the NYC best 100 hamburger over 3 years and can say that this would rank at the top.  I'm glad Fatheads was too busy because now I know where to go for the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Try it you won't regret it."
"I grew up 45 minutes north of this Pittsburgh spot, but made the trip for Lulu's pan fried noodles as often as I could. Now I live 8 hours east in NYC and still do the same thing. The mix of crunchy and soft noodles are great, the shiitakes are perfectly flavored, and oddly enough...the leftovers taste even better the next day."
"Dr. Steelman at Bonanza is simply put, in my opinion the very best (and fairest) cat vet in Las Vegas. She is very, very knowledgeable and very compassionate. I'll take any and all of my cats to Dr. Steelman until the end of time."
"An excellent museum that has something of real interest for everyone. I'm not a big fan of experimental art but there were pieces and installations that were really cool and command your attention whilst the Chinese and Japanese rooms are well put together and very interesting.  \n\nYou could be there for most of the day if you want- I was there for two hours and probably only managed to look at 50% of the rooms in any real depth. For a city that supposedly 'lacks culture', PAM is as good a place to spend an afternoon as anywhere in New York and so on."
"I ordered the salmon and eggs special from the New Year's Day menu. The salmon was flavorful and pulled apart nicely; it wasn't overcooked and dry. The price, under $10, was reasonable. The staff was attentive and ensured we were satisfied with our orders. Bottomless cup of Just Coffee was self-serve."
"I really love Sally's; I buy the Hairtrition line of haircare products because the moisturizing line actually WORKS! It makes my hair super shiny and soft. \n\nThey also carry my favorite nail polish line; China Glaze. If you sign up for a sally card they're only $4.50 or so, as opposed to nearly $6. The savings add up if you're a nail polish junkie like I am! \n\nThis location is often clean and quiet, with decent parking. Sometimes the lot can fill up and be a little more of a challenge to park in, but it's not the store's fault. \n\nThe employees here have been helpful and pleasant. \n\nThis is NOT a promotional store; the crackle line of polishes was never shipped here, so don't come here expecting to find a limited run unless it's on sale from another store..."
"It tastes pretty decent for your average Chinese takeout.  I was going to give it 3 stars because the delivery took an hour when my estimated delivery time was for 35 minutes. However, the serving sizes are very large for the very affordable prices! Not to mention the large soup size for only $1.50! For a family of 6 we ordered 4 soups and 4 entrees with plenty of food leftover, thus earning it another star."
"We recently moved into the neighborhood and decided to give this place a try. Since my husband is a picky eater, I decided to order take out in person for the first time. Service was friendly and efficient. Good knowledge of the menu and answered my questions nicely. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name. Very helpful with special orders. Everything was fast, fresh, tasty, and most importantly, correct. We will be back and we are looking forward to trying the delivery."
Love this place.  The pizzas are perfect New York style and when I ask them to cook it a little well done....they actually do.  Garlic knots are crazy good.  The owners and staff are a blast to be around.
"Worth for you cost, food is tasty and I like spicy as I am from South India and as I asked for extra spicy they really cooked chicken fried rice and Penang curry as I was expecting to eat. Definitely good place for Togo style, restaurant ambiance is not good. Very near to stratosphere hotel and casino."
"I have known JC for 13 years. She does a fantastic job and is extremely knowledgeable. She helps advise me as to what will look good. She did my hair for my beach wedding, and it was more beautiful than I could have imagined! I wouldn't trust my hair to anyone else! Thanks JC!"
"I was impressed with the no-pressure approach of the manager, Todd. \n \nIt seems they are about building customer relationships."
"Ate here again Thursday night - had the broccoli in hot garlic sauce. Was good (again, wish it were spicier so I should ask next time) but I loved the vegetable roll. Please do not be put off by some of the negative reviews. I enjoyed my second time here and intend to make semi-regular visits as I live nearby."
"Whenever I'm in town, I make sure to stop here.  It's a welcome respite from the meat and potatoes fare at most other restaurants.  I am in love with the salad pita, and the homemade dressings, ESPECIALLY the sesame dressing btw, are to die for!  The food is always fresh and delicious, and healthy too.  Plus you never have to wait long!  The only caveat is that the desserts look better than they actually are..but I am picky!  (Plus in the summer, you should probably just venture outside to the ice cream place nearby instead anyway..its' famous!  All in all, this is a GREAT place! YUM."
This UPS location has some of the best customer service I have ever experience. They are extremely nice and helpful knowledgeable. They have patients and process clients quickly.
"This is my local branch and I have had nothing but good service whenever needed. The staff seem to be happy and there is not too much turnover, the ATM is in the lobby and it can accept a cash deposit in several denominations. \n\nParking is great and it is just a couple doors from Starbucks which is my favorite morning destination."
"I needed a new suit recently, and had an outstanding experience here.  \n\nThe sales associate at the Men's Wearhouse was very professional and cordial.  When i described what I what looking for, he showed me the perfect suit.\n\nThe jacket sleeves and pants legs were a little long, but they tailored them to a perfect fit for me within a couple of days."
"I have always enjoyed Panera.  Food is fresh and usually very good.  Every so often you get something not as good as you expected, but that can happen almost anywhere.  One thing I really enjoy is their fresh brewed iced tea. Always refreshing on the hot summer days in Las Vegas.  I wish they would serve a traditional style breakfast (eggs, meat, potato's) with one of their fresh baked breads."
"Espresso Royale is one of many coffee shops on State Street. I continue to stop there over other places because it's near campus, has friendly staff and lots of seating, and makes good drinks!\n\nI have never had any complaints about Espresso Royale, but it doesn't have that extra special touch to earn a 5th start."
"I really like this bar. Each time I've been here, whether it be during a pub crawl, happy hour after work or an hour or 2 before a Suns game, I have yet to experience poor service.  The atmosphere is cozy, clean  and a good mix of casual and business.\nRecently they also added a small sushi bar which I look forward to trying. \nNext time your exploring downtown PHX, make this place one of your stops!"
"I LOVE the Bacado. There is nothing better for nursing a hangover than the Good Egg. \n\nWe try to visit every few weeks. Yes, the wait for a table can be long, but it's totally worth it!"
"We got the tasting menu (no wine pairings). The amuse was amazing (never knew I liked cottage cheese). Loved the octopus appetizer (could have used a few more on the plate) and the agnolotti was perfectly cooked. I had the tenderloin as the main course and although slightly overdone, was gone in about 5 minutes. I've had better crumble but this one was perfectly acceptable. The service was top-notch. You could really tell the server had a passion for the food."
Great Pizza!\nI mean really great. Best pizza so far in Oakland area.\n\nUpdate: the dough of the pizza made by the lady who works there (not by an old guy) was a little too thicker than I've expected.
"Fun little shop!  Love that they carry Zutano, Jefferies Socks, Haba, Robeez, etc. The guy behind the counter was very welcoming and nice.  Well laid out for a small shop, filled with great stuff, but not overwhelmingly packed - plenty of room to move around and browse.  A great spot to find age appropriate, fun and whimsical clothing items.  Wonderful place to find unique gifts.\n\nMy one complaint is their prices - a bit too high! Though, I realize they must have a smaller inventory, etc. which will be reflected in prices... \n\nOverall, great little shop and I look forward to visiting again when we're back in Madison."
"we went at 845 on a friday night with our baby and she still seated us and was totally sweet.  Best Mu SHu I've had in the valley.   I also had the ribs, and those for some reason are hard to find here in Phoenix.  they were pretty good.\n\nI'll go back, but it was a little spendy.  the ambience was just ok, but with a baby and our lateness the food came out fast and was pretty good and she wasn't mad (or at least she pretended not to be) so I'll take it!"
Great Mexican food for the price. Esteban is a very courteous waiter. The gringo dip is a frat choice for an appetizer.
"I actually really like the subs at Jimmy John's.  They're pretty much no-nonsense quick cold subs.  No salads, no soups, no toasting.  You can get chips and a cookie if you want, but that's pretty much all for sides.  (I think they might have pickles too?)  Anywho, the subs are huge and tasty and very quick!"
Great place to take out of town friends. Excellent happy hour specials & delicious pizzas. There was a period where service was a bit lacking (waiting over a hour for food) but things seem back to normal now. I've been coming here for over 10 years & overall the service is great and you can't beat the ambiance.
"Great food, great/fun service! Bring an appetite!  We were hungry after a long walk- this negated the issue. Our server was fun and the manager was accommodating. Highly recommend."
"I love bread.  I love pastries.  Mirabelle supplies those both in short order and they're' delicious, although a bit pricey.  That's fine, they're worth it when it's the weekend after getting my stipend and some high-falootin', gussied up pastry seems appropriate on a Saturday morning.\n\nWho says grad students don't have fun?\n\nIn all seriousness, it's a quality local bakery and well worth it."
"There is nothing better than Blackened Mahi Mahi Tacos and a Silver Surfer Margarita and the only place you can find such a delicious meal is...........CABO FISH TACO!!!!!!\n\nI have fallen in love with this place over four years ago and am so very thankful for the expansion and outdoor area.  They could extend the whole block and still have an hour wait on weekends.  \n\nI have tried many things on their menu, but I stick with my old faithful because it's crazy good.  I have never actually had bad service there, mostly the wait staff is attentive and very easy going with suggestions about the menu or specials.  \n\nWill continue to frequent!  Thank you for being awesome"
Flat bread pizza was pretty good.  Clean restaurant and the staff is very attentive. Not much of chain restaurant person but I don't mind dining here. It's always nice to come down to Station Square and get a change of scenery.
Frank and Fred are the best... I bought both my cars with these guys and they also service them too... No hassle auto sales!!!
"A trip downtown usually warrants a visit to Luv-It. It's a little stand on the corner with a parking lot (although, I usually just walk over here).\n\nThere are some daily flavors that you can get, but I just go for the Western special. Vanilla custard with caramel, fudge, pecans.. Perfect combo.\n\nSome may say the location is sketch, which I won't disagree with, but it adds a certain charm to the business."
